In the Green Paper on Future Noise Policy, the Commission addressed noise in the environment as one of the main environmental problems in Europe.(2) In its Resolution of 10 June 1997(5) on the Commission Green Paper, the European Parliament expressed its support for that Green Paper, urged that specific measures and initiatives should be laid down in a Directive on the reduction of environmental noise, and noted the lack of reliable, comparable data regarding the situation of the various noise sources.(3) A common noise indicator and a common methodology for noise calculation and measurement around airports were identified in the Commission Communication of 1 December 1999 on Air Transport and the Environment. This communication has been taken into account in the provisions of this Directive.(4) Certain categories of noise emissions from products are already covered by Community legislation, such as Council Directive 70/157/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles(6), Council Directive 77/311/EEC of 29 March 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the driver-perceived noise level of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors(7), Council Directive 80/51/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the limitation of noise emissions from subsonic aircraft(8) and its complementary directives, Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles(9) and Directive 2000/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors(10).(5) This Directive should inter alia provide a basis for developing and completing the existing set of Community measures concerning noise emitted by the major sources, in particular road and rail vehicles and infrastructure, aircraft, outdoor and industrial equipment and mobile machinery, and for developing additional measures, in the short, medium and long term.(6) Certain categories of noise such as noise created inside means of transport and noise from domestic activities should not be subject to this Directive.(7) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, the Treaty objectives of achieving a high level of protection of the environment and of health will be better reached by complementing the action of the Member States by a Community action achieving a common understanding of the noise problem. Data about environmental noise levels should therefore be collected, collated or reported in accordance with comparable criteria. This implies the use of harmonised indicators and evaluation methods, as well as criteria for the alignment of noise-mapping. Such criteria and methods can best be established by the Community.(8) It is also necessary to establish common assessment methods for \"environmental noise\" and a definition for \"limit values\", in terms of harmonised indicators for the determination of noise levels. The concrete figures of any limit values are to be determined by the Member States, taking into account, inter alia, the need to apply the principle of prevention in order to preserve quiet areas in agglomerations.(9) The selected common noise indicators are Lden, to assess annoyance, and Lnight, to assess sleep disturbance. It is also useful to allow Member States to use supplementary indicators in order to monitor or control special noise situations.(10) Strategic noise mapping should be imposed in certain areas of interest as it can capture the data needed to provide a representation of the noise levels perceived within that area.(11) Action plans should address priorities in those areas of interest and should be drawn up by the competent authorities in consultation with the public.(12) In order to have a wide spread of information to the public, the most appropriate information channels should be selected.(13) Data collection and the consolidation of suitable Community-wide reports are required as a basis for future Community policy and for further information of the public.(14) An evaluation of the implementation of this Directive should be carried out regularly by the Commission.(15) The technical provisions governing the assessment methods should be supplemented and adapted as necessary to technical and scientific progress and to progress in European standardisation.(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(11),HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1Objectives1. The aim of this Directive shall be to define a common approach intended to avoid, prevent or reduce on a prioritised basis the harmful effects, including annoyance, due to exposure to environmental noise. To that end the following actions shall be implemented progressively:(a) the determination of exposure to environmental noise, through noise mapping, by methods of assessment common to the Member States;(b) ensuring that information on environmental noise and its effects is made available to the public;(c) adoption of action plans by the Member States, based upon noise-mapping results, with a view to preventing and reducing environmental noise where necessary and particularly where exposure levels can induce harmful effects on human health and to preserving environmental noise quality where it is good.2. This Directive shall also aim at providing a basis for developing Community measures to reduce noise emitted by the major sources, in particular road and rail vehicles and infrastructure, aircraft, outdoor and industrial equipment and mobile machinery. To this end, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council, no later than 18 July 2006, appropriate legislative proposals. Those proposals should take into account the results of the report referred to in Article 10(1).Article 2Scope1.

A summary setting out the most important points shall be provided.Article 10Collection and publication of data by Member States and the Commission1. No later than 18 January 2004, the Commission will submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council containing a review of existing Community measures relating to sources of environmental noise.2. The Member States shall ensure that the information from strategic noise maps and summaries of the action plans as referred to in Annex VI are sent to the Commission within six months of the dates laid down in Articles 7 and 8 respectively.3. The Commission shall set up a database of information on strategic noise maps in order to facilitate the compilation of the report referred to in Article 11 and other technical and informative work.4. Every five years the Commission shall publish a summary report of data from strategic noise maps and action plans. The first report shall be submitted by 18 July 2009.Article 11Review and reporting1. No later than 18 July 2009, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the implementation of this Directive.2. That report shall in particular assess the need for further Community actions on environmental noise and, if appropriate, propose implementing strategies on aspects such as:(a) long-term and medium-term goals for the reduction of the number of persons harmfully affected by environmental noise, taking particularly into account the different climates and different cultures;(b) additional measures for a reduction of the environmental noise emitted by specific sources, in particular outdoor equipment, means and infrastructures of transport and certain categories of industrial activity, building on those measures already implemented or under discussion for adoption;(c) the protection of quiet areas in open country.3. The report shall include a review of the acoustic environment quality in the Community based on the data referred to in Article 10 and shall take account of scientific and technical progress and any other relevant information. The reduction of harmful effects and the cost-effectiveness ratio shall be the main criteria for the selection of the strategies and measures proposed.4. When the Commission has received the first set of strategic noise maps, it shall reconsider:- the possibility for a 1,5 metre measurement height in Annex I, paragraph 1, in respect of areas having houses of one storey,- the lower limit for the estimated number of people exposed to different bands of Lden and Lnight in Annex VI.5. The report shall be reviewed every five years or more often if appropriate. It shall contain an assessment of the implementation of this Directive.6. The report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by proposals for the amendment of this Directive.Article 12AdaptationThe Commission shall adapt Annex I, point 3, Annex II and Annex III hereto to technical and scientific progress in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 13(2).Article 13Committee1.

Definition of the day-evening-night level LdenThe day-evening-night level Lden in decibels (dB) is defined by the following formula:>PIC FILE= \"L_2002189EN.001802.TIF\">in which:- Lday is the A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in ISO 1996-2: 1987, determined over all the day periods of a year,- Levening is the A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in ISO 1996-2: 1987, determined over all the evening periods of a year,- Lnight is the A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in ISO 1996-2: 1987, determined over all the night periods of a year;in which:- the day is 12 hours, the evening four hours and the night eight hours. The Member States may shorten the evening period by one or two hours and lengthen the day and/or the night period accordingly, provided that this choice is the same for all the sources and that they provide the Commission with information on any systematic difference from the default option,- the start of the day (and consequently the start of the evening and the start of the night) shall be chosen by the Member State (that choice shall be the same for noise from all sources); the default values are 07.00 to 19.00, 19.00 to 23.00 and 23.00 to 07.00 local time,- a year is a relevant year as regards the emission of sound and an average year as regards the meteorological circumstances;and in which:- the incident sound is considered, which means that no account is taken of the sound that is reflected at the façade of the dwelling under consideration (as a general rule, this implies a 3 dB correction in case of measurement).The height of the Lden assessment point depends on the application:- in the case of computation for the purpose of strategic noise mapping in relation to noise exposure in and near buildings, the assessment points must be 4,0 ± 0,2 m (3,8 to 4,2 m) above the ground and at the most exposed façade; for this purpose, the most exposed façade will be the external wall facing onto and nearest to the specific noise source; for other purposes other choices may be made,- in the case of measurement for the purpose of strategic noise mapping in relation to noise exposure in and near buildings, other heights may be chosen, but they must never be less than 1,5 m above the ground, and results should be corrected in accordance with an equivalent height of 4 m,- for other purposes such as acoustical planning and noise zoning other heights may be chosen, but they must never be less than 1,5 m above the ground, for example for:- rural areas with one-storey houses,- the design of local measures meant to reduce the noise impact on specific dwellings,- the detailed noise mapping of a limited area, showing the noise exposure of individual dwellings.2. Definition of the night-time noise indicatorThe night-time noise indicator Lnight is the A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in ISO 1996-2: 1987, determined over all the night periods of a year;in which:- the night is eight hours as defined in paragraph 1,- a year is a relevant year as regards the emission of sound and an average year as regards the meteorological circumstances, as defined in paragraph 1,- the incident sound is considered, as laid down in paragraph 1,- the assessment point is the same as for Lden.3. Supplementary noise indicatorsIn some cases, in addition to Lden and Lnight, and where appropriate Lday and Levening, it may be advantageous to use special noise indicators and related limit values. Some examples are given below:- the noise source under consideration operates only for a small proportion of the time (for example, less than 20 % of the time over the total of the day periods in a year, the total of the evening periods in a year, or the total of the night periods in a year),- the average number of noise events in one or more of the periods is very low (for example, less than one noise event an hour; a noise event could be defined as a noise that lasts less than five minutes; examples are the noise from a passing train or a passing aircraft),- the low-frequency content of the noise is strong,- LAmax, or SEL (sound exposure level) for night period protection in the case of noise peaks,- extra protection at the weekend or a specific part of the year,- extra protection of the day period,- extra protection of the evening period,- a combination of noises from different sources,- quiet areas in open country,- the noise contains strong tonal components,- the noise has an impulsive character.ANNEX IIASSESSMENT METHODS FOR THE NOISE INDICATORSreferred to in Article 61. IntroductionThe values of Lden and Lnight can be determined either by computation or by measurement (at the assessment position). For predictions only computation is applicable.Provisional computation and measurement methods are set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.2. Interim computation methods for Lden and Lnight2.1. Adaptation of existing national computation methodsIf a Member State has national methods for the determination of long-term indicators those methods may be applied, provided that they are adapted to the definitions of the indicators set out in Annex I. For most national methods this implies the introduction of the evening as a separate period and the introduction of the average over a year. Some existing methods will also have to be adapted as regards the exclusion of the façade reflection, the incorporation of the night and/or the assessment position.The establishment of the average over a year requires special attention. Variations in emission and transmission can contribute to fluctuations over a year.2.2. Recommended interim computation methodsFor Member States that have no national computation methods or Member States that wish to change computation method, the following methods are recommended:For INDUSTRIAL NOISE: ISO 9613-2: \"Acoustics - Abatement of sound propagation outdoors, Part 2: General method of calculation\".Suitable noise-emission data (input data) for this method can be obtained from measurements carried out in accordance with one of the following methods:- ISO 8297: 1994 \"Acoustics - Determination of sound power levels of multisource industrial plants for evaluation of sound pressure levels in the environment - Engineering method\",- EN ISO 3744: 1995 \"Acoustics - Determination of sound power levels of noise using sound pressure - Engineering method in an essentially free field over a reflecting plane\",- EN ISO 3746: 1995 \"Acoustics - Determination of sound power levels of noise sources using an enveloping measurement surface over a reflecting plane\".For AIRCRAFT NOISE: ECAC.CEAC Doc. 29 \"Report on Standard Method of Computing Noise Contours around Civil Airports\", 1997. Of the different approaches to the modelling of flight paths, the segmentation technique referred to in section 7.5 of ECAC.CEAC Doc. 29 will be used.For ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE: The French national computation method \"NMPB-Routes-96 (SETRA-CERTU-LCPC-CSTB)\", referred to in \"Arrêté du 5 mai 1995 relatif au bruit des infrastructures routières, Journal Officiel du 10 mai 1995, Article 6\" and in the French standard \"XPS 31-133\". For input data concerning emission, these documents refer to the \"Guide du bruit des transports terrestres, fascicule prévision des niveaux sonores, CETUR 1980\".For RAILWAY NOISE: The Netherlands national computation method published in \"Reken- en Meetvoorschrift Railverkeerslawaai '96, Ministerie Volkshuisvesting, Ruimtelijke Ordening en Milieubeheer, 20 November 1996\".Those methods must be adapted to the definitions of Lden and Lnight. No later than 1 July 2003 the Commission will publish guidelines in accordance with Article 13(2) on the revised methods and provide emission data for aircraft noise, road traffic noise and railway noise on the basis of existing data.3. Interim measurement methods for Lden and LnightIf a Member State wishes to use its own official measurement method, that method shall be adapted in accordance with the definitions of the indicators set out in Annex I and in accordance with the principles governing long-term average measurements stated in ISO 1996-2: 1987 and ISO 1996-1: 1982.If a Member State has no measurement method or if it prefers to apply another method, a method may be defined on the basis of the definition of the indicator and the principles stated in ISO 1996-2: 1987 and ISO 1996-1: 1982.Measurement data in front of a façade or another reflecting element must be corrected to exclude the reflected contribution of this façade or element (as a general rule, this implies a 3 dB correction in case of measurement).ANNEX IIIASSESSMENT METHODS FOR HARMFUL EFFECTSreferred to in Article 6(3)Dose-effect relations should be used to assess the effect of noise on populations. The dose-effect relations introduced by future revisions of this Annex in accordance with Article 13(2) will concern in particular:- the relation between annoyance and Lden for road, rail and air traffic noise, and for industrial noise,- the relation between sleep disturbance and Lnight for road, rail and air traffic noise, and for industrial noise.If necessary, specific dose-effect relations could be presented for:- dwellings with special insulation against noise as defined in Annex VI,- dwellings with a quiet façade as defined in Annex VI,- different climates/different cultures,- vulnerable groups of the population,- tonal industrial noise,- impulsive industrial noise and other special cases.ANNEX IVMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR STRATEGIC NOISE MAPPINGreferred to in Article 71. A strategic noise map is the presentation of data on one of the following aspects:- an existing, a previous or a predicted noise situation in terms of a noise indicator,- the exceeding of a limit value,- the estimated number of dwellings, schools and hospitals in a certain area that are exposed to specific values of a noise indicator,- the estimated number of people located in an area exposed to noise.2. Strategic noise maps may be presented to the public as:- graphical plots,- numerical data in tables,- numerical data in electronic form.3. Strategic noise maps for agglomerations shall put a special emphasis on the noise emitted by:- road traffic,- rail traffic,- airports,- industrial activity sites, including ports.4. Strategic noise mapping will be used for the following purposes:- the provision of the data to be sent to the Commission in accordance with Article 10(2) and Annex VI,- a source of information for citizens in accordance with Article 9,- a basis for action plans in accordance with Article 8.Each of those applications requires a different type of strategic noise map.5. Minimum requirements for the strategic noise maps concerning the data to be sent to the Commission are set out in paragraphs 1.5, 1.6, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 of Annex VI.6. For the purposes of informing the citizen in accordance with Article 9 and the development of action plans in accordance with Article 8, additional and more detailed information must be given, such as:- a graphical presentation,- maps disclosing the exceeding of a limit value,- difference maps, in which the existing situation is compared with various possible future situations,- maps showing the value of a noise indicator at a height other than 4 m where appropriate.The Member States may lay down rules on the types and formats of these noise maps.7. Strategic noise maps for local or national application must be made for an assessment height of 4 m and the 5 dB ranges of Lden and Lnight as defined in Annex VI.8. For agglomerations separate strategic noise maps must be made for road-traffic noise, rail-traffic noise, aircraft noise and industrial noise. Maps for other sources may be added.9. The Commission may develop guidelines providing further guidance on noise maps, noise mapping and mapping softwares in accordance with Article 13(2).ANNEX VMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR ACTION PLANSreferred to in Article 81. An action plan must at least include the following elements:- a description of the agglomeration, the major roads, the major railways or major airports and other noise sources taken into account,- the authority responsible,- the legal context,- any limit values in place in accordance with Article 5,- a summary of the results of the noise mapping,- an evaluation of the estimated number of people exposed to noise, identification of problems and situations that need to be improved,- a record of the public consultations organised in accordance with Article 8(7),- any noise-reduction measures already in force and any projects in preparation,- actions which the competent authorities intend to take in the next five years, including any measures to preserve quiet areas,- long-term strategy,- financial information (if available): budgets, cost-effectiveness assessment, cost-benefit assessment,- provisions envisaged for evaluating the implementation and the results of the action plan.2. The actions which the competent authorities intend to take in the fields within their competence may for example include:- traffic planning,- land-use planning,- technical measures at noise sources,- selection of quieter sources,- reduction of sound transmission,- regulatory or economic measures or incentives.3. Each action plan should contain estimates in terms of the reduction of the number of people affected (annoyed, sleep disturbed, or other).4. The Commission may develop guidelines providing further guidance on the action plans in accordance with Article 13(2).ANNEX VIDATA TO BE SENT TO THE COMMISSIONreferred to in Article 10The data to be sent to the Commission are as follows:1.

GuidelinesThe Commission may develop guidelines to provide further guidance on the above provision of information, in accordance with Article 13(2).Declaration by the Commissionin the Conciliation Committee on the Directive relating to the assessment and management of environmental noiseThe Commission takes note of the text agreed for Article 1(2) of the Environmental Noise Directive by the members of the Conciliation Committee for the European Parliament and the Council.The Commission considers that legislative proposals to reduce noise emissions from all major sources should be made on the basis of robust evidence supporting such proposals. This is in line with the \"knowledge-based approach\" for policy-making as proposed in the Sixth Environment Action Programme (COM(2001)31) and approved by the European Parliament and the Council.In this regard, the reports required from Member States under the Directive on the basis of harmonised noise indicators will be an essential element. The provision of such data across the Community will allow the impact and benefits of possible measures to be properly assessed prior to presenting Community legislative proposals.Therefore, and in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Commission will evaluate the need to come forward with new legislative proposals, reserving its right to decide as and when it would be appropriate to present any such proposals.This is consistent with the Commission's right of initiative, as laid out in the Treaty, while the requirements of Article 1(2) relating to the submission of new proposals within a fixed time frame appear to be prejudicial to this right.", "summary": "Assessment and management of environmental noise\nAssessment and management of environmental noise\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nThe Environmental Noise Directive (END) aims to:\nprovide a common basis for combating the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise* across the EU;\ngradually introduce measures establishing common noise indicators* to measure the long-term exposure of humans to environmental noise throughout the day and sleep disturbancesobliging EU countries to draw up strategic noise maps* to serve as a basis for action plans* to prevent and reduce noiseimplementing the national action plansfor public information and consultation, especially about the national action plans.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive seeks to control noise:\nin built-up areas;\nin public parks or other quiet areas in urban areas;\nin quiet areas in open country;\nnear schools, hospitals and other noise-sensitive buildings and areas.\nIt does not apply to noise:\ncaused by the exposed person him or herself, or by neighbours;\nfrom domestic activities;\nin work places;\ninside means of transport; and\nfrom military activities in military areas.\nNoise indicators and their assessment methods\n2 indicators are used when compiling strategic noise maps: Lden is an indicator of the overall noise level during the day, evening and night which is used to describe the annoyance caused by exposure to noise;Lnight is an indicator for the sound level during the night used to describe sleep disturbance.Their values are defined using the common assessment methods set out in Annex II to the directive.\nThe European Commission had to establish these common assessment methods. Until this was done, EU countries could use their own methods, provided they complied with Annex II.\nOther indicators may be used for acoustical planning and noise zoning and in the special cases listed in Annex I.\nDose-effect relations* would be introduced in Annex III by future revisions to the directive to enable the assessment of the effect of noise on populations.\nBy 18 July 2005, EU countries had to inform the Commission of any relevant limit values in force or under preparation, expressed in terms of Lden and Lnight and, where appropriate, Lday (day-noise indicator) and Levening (evening-noise indicator) for: road-traffic noise;air-traffic noise;rail-traffic noise; andindustrial noise.\nStrategic noise mapping\nStrategic noise maps must satisfy the minimum requirements laid down in Annex IV.\nEU countries had to: inform the public of the bodies responsible for making and approving strategic noise maps by 18 July 2005;inform the Commission by 30 June 2005 of the major roads with more than 6 million vehicle passages a yearrailways with more than 60,000 train passages per yearmajor airports andtowns and cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants;make and approve strategic noise maps showing the situation during the preceding year near these infrastructures, towns and cities by 30 June 2007;inform the Commission of all the towns and cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and of all the major roads and major railways within their territories by 31 December 2008;make and approve strategic noise maps showing the situation during the preceding year for those towns and cities, roads and railways by30 June 2012.\nNoise maps must be reviewed, and revised if necessary, every 5 years.\nAction plans\nAction plans must meet the minimum requirements set out in Annex V.\nMeasures within the plans must: address priorities identified by the exceeding of any relevant limit value or by other criteria chosen by the EU countries; andapply in particular to the most important areas as established by strategic mapping.\nEU countries had to: inform the public of the bodies responsible for drawing up and approving the action plans by 18 July 2005;draw up action plans: by 18 July 2008, for major roads with more than 6 million vehicle passages a yearrailways with more than 60,000 train passages per yearmajor airports andtowns and cities with over 250,000 inhabitants;by 18 July 2013, for all major towns and cities, major airports, major roads and major railways.\nAction plans must be reviewed when a major development occurs affecting the existing noise situation, and at least every 5 years after the date of the approval of those plans, according to amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1010.\nPublic information\nEU countries must ensure that:\nthe public is consulted and that the results are taken into account before action plans are approved;\nstrategic noise maps and the action plans are available and disseminated to the public in line with Annexes IV and V and the EU’s rules on public access to environmental information;\nthe Commission receives the information from strategic noise maps and summaries of the action plans within 6 months of the dates laid down in Articles 7 (Strategic noise mapping) and 8 (Action plans), as referred to in Annex VI. The Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency, must develop a digital information exchange mechanism, by means of implementing acts.\nEU countries’ noise maps and action plans can also be consulted in the European Environment Agency’s ReportNet system. According to amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1010, ReportNet is a ‘data repository’, an information system containing environmental noise information and data made available by the EU countries.\nReportEvery 5 years, the Commission submits a report on the directive’s implementation to the European Parliament and the Council.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 18 July 2002 and had to become law in the EU countries by 18 July 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEnvironmental Noise Directive (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nEnvironmental noise: unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities, including noise emitted by means of transport, road traffic, rail traffic, air traffic, and from sites of industrial activity, as defined by Directive 96/61/EC.\nNoise indicator: a physical scale to describe environmental noise, which has a relationship with a harmful effect.\nStrategic noise maps: maps designed to assess the overall noise exposure in given areas arising from different noise sources or for overall predictions for those areas.\nAction plans: plans designed to manage noise issues and effects, including noise reduction if necessary.\nDose-effect relation: the relationship between the value of a noise indicator and a harmful effect.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (OJ L 189, 18.7.2002, pp. 12-25)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2002/49/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
