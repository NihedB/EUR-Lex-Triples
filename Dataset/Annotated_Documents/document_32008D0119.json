INTRODUCTION\nThe proposed revised Accession Partnership updates the first one, on the basis of the findings of the 2007 Commission’s Progress Report on Croatia. It identifies new as well as remaining priorities for action. The new priorities are adapted to the country’s specific needs and stage of preparation and will be updated as necessary. Croatia is expected to develop a plan including a timetable and specific measures intended to address the Accession Partnership priorities. The Accession Partnership also provides guidance for financial assistance to the country.\n2.   PRINCIPLES\nThe Stabilisation and Association Process remains the framework for the European course of the Western Balkan countries, all the way to their future accession. The main priorities identified for Croatia relate to its capacity to meet the criteria defined by the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 and the conditions set for the Stabilisation and Association Process, notably the conditions defined by the Council in its Conclusions of 29 April 1997 and of 21 and 22 June 1999, the final declaration of the Zagreb Summit of 24 November 2000 and the Thessaloniki Agenda, and the requirements of the negotiating framework adopted by the Council on 3 October 2005.\n3.   PRIORITIES\nThe priorities listed in this Accession Partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Croatia can complete them or take them substantially forward over the next few years. The priorities concern both legislation and the implementation thereof.\nIn view of the need to set priorities, it is clear that there are other tasks for Croatia to complete which may become priorities in any future partnership, also taking into account future progress made by Croatia.\nAmong the priorities, the key priorities have been identified and grouped together at the beginning of the section below.

Accordingly, this Decision will have no financial implications. The financing agreements serve as legal basis for the implementation of the concrete programmes.\nCroatia can also have access to funding from multi-country and horizontal programmes.\n5.   CONDITIONALITY\nAssistance to the Western Balkan countries is conditional on further progress on satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and on meeting the requirements of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and specific priorities of this Accession Partnership. Failure to respect these conditions could lead the Council to take appropriate measures on the basis of Article 21 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 or, in the case of pre-2007 programmes, on the basis of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000. The assistance is also subject to the conditions defined by the Council in its conclusions of 29 April 1997, in particular as regards the recipients’ undertaking to carry out democratic, economic and institutional reforms. Specific conditions are also included in individual annual programmes. The financing decisions will be followed by a financing agreement signed with Croatia.\n6.   MONITORING\nThe implementation of the Accession Partnership shall be examined in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process, including through the annual Reports presented by the Commission, in the context of the political and economic dialogues, as well as on the basis of information provided to the accession conference.\n(1)  Some Member States underlined in this context the importance of accelerating the process of restitution of property, in line with the relevant Croatian Constitutional Court rulings.\n(2)  OJ L 306, 7.12.2000, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2112/2005 (OJ L 344, 27.12.2005, p. 23).", "summary": "Accession Partnership with Croatia\nAccession Partnership with Croatia\nThe purpose of the Accession Partnership is to assist the Croatian authorities in their efforts to meet the accession criteria, especially the political criteria (or Copenhagen criteria). It covers in detail the principles and priorities for the country’s accession preparations, with particular reference to implementation of the acquis, and forms the reference framework for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds.\nACT\nCouncil Decision 2008/119/EC of 12 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with Croatia and repealing Decision 2006/145/EC.\nSUMMARY\nThe Accession Partnership is the main instrument intended to provide the Croatian authorities with guidance in their preparations for accession to the European Union (EU) since accession negotiations were started on 3 October 2005. This Accession Partnership is an instrument in the pre-accession strategy.\nThe legal basis of the Accession Partnership with Croatia is Regulation (EC) No 533/2004 establishing partnerships with countries of the western Balkans. The partnerships are flexible instruments modified according to progress achieved and tasks remaining. The priorities identified are thus defined by the Commission's opinion on the accession request. They are modified, if necessary, on the basis of reports.\nThe Council of the EU adopts the Accession Partnership, and any subsequent amendments, by a qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the partnership for accession is to register in a single legal framework:\nthe priorities for reform;\nguidelines for financial assistance with a view to implementing these priority areas;\nthe principles and conditions for implementing the Partnership.\nIn order to achieve the priorities identified in the Accession Partnership, Croatia is adopting a national programme for transposing the Community acquis (NPAA). This includes the procedures and programme for implementing the Partnership.\nThe follow-up to the Partnership implementation is ensured within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), notably the Commission's annual follow-up reports.\nPRIORITIES\nThe priorities are both realistic and attainable goals relating to legislation and its implementation. They are based principally on Croatia's ability to comply with:\nthe Copenhagen criteria laid down in 1993;\nthe conditions set for the stabilisation and association process (Council conclusions of 27 April 1997 and 21 and 22 June 1999);\nthe Zagreb declaration of 2000;\nthe 2003 Thessaloniki agenda;\nthe negotiation framework adopted on 3 October 2005.\nThe Accession Partnership with Croatia includes:\nkey priorities, which are short-term priorities. They relate to: commitments made under the SAA; reform of public administration and the judicial system; the fight against corruption; application of the Constitutional Law on National Minorities; completion of the refugee return and integration process; reconciliation among citizens in the region; cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY); resolution of outstanding bilateral issues, particularly in fields relating to borders and fishing; and improvement in business and economic growth potential;\npolitical criteria, most importantly democracy and the rule of law (public administration, judicial system, fight against corruption), human rights and the protection of minorities, regional issues and international obligations (protecting the environment and fishing, refugee return, reintegrating returnees, criminal proceedings as regards war crimes, judicial, police and regional cooperation, and border and bilateral issues);\neconomic criteria aiming to guarantee macroeconomic stability, budgetary transparency and management of public debt, to improve management of the health sector, the social welfare system and pensions, to facilitate business entry, to improve the institutional framework for privatisation and restructuring of public enterprises, and to strengthen the labour market;\nthe ability to assume the obligations of membership, namely adoption and implementation of the acquis for 33 of the 35 chapters (thematically arranged by EU legislation policy) to which the accession negotiations apply.\nThe priorities identified in this Partnership will constitute the basis for future evaluations by the Commission, which regularly evaluates the progress made by Croatia on compliance with the accession criteria, including on the adoption and effective implementation of the acquis.\nFINANCIAL FRAMEWORK\nCroatia has benefited from financial assistance intended to support it in preparing for accession with the pre-accession financial instrument (IPA) for the period 2007-2013. The IPA replaces the instruments Phare, ISPA and SAPARD and CARDS, from which Croatia benefited in the period 2000–2006.\nThe assistance planned for Croatia under the IPA includes the multiannual indicative financial framework (MIFF link to related MIFF acts) for the period 2009–2011 and the aid planned for Croatia, namely around EUR 749.8 million (including 2007 and 2008). The country is also eligible for funding (including loans and grants) from the European Investment Bank (EIB) under its external lending mandate for the EU's south-eastern neighbours.\nIn this context, the accession partnership for Croatia serves as a reference framework for determining the different areas to which funds will be allocated. However, the decisions instituting the financial instruments and the programming documents form the legal framework for financial assistance. Failure to comply with the SAA, the Copenhagen criteria and the priorities defined by the Partnership may result in financial assistance being suspended.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2008/119/EC\n19.2.2008\n-\nOJ L 42 of 16.2.2008\nRELATED ACTS\nCommission Communication of 20 April 2004: Opinion on Croatia’s Application for Membership of the European Union [COM(2004) 257 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nConclusions of the Brussels European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 (FR) (pdf).\n               The European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Turkey.\nBILATERAL RELATIONS\nStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, on the other: [Official Journal L 26 of 28.1.2005].\nFINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 of 17 July 2006 establishing an instrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA) [Official Journal L 210 of 31.7.2006].\nMulti-annual indicative financial framework (MIFF) for:\n2008–2010 [COM(2006) 672 final – Not published in the Official Journal];\n2009–2011 [COM(2007) 689 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nMultiannual indicative planning document 2007–2009 for Croatia [EN] [PDF].\nEVALUATION\nThe Reports (EN) are available on the website of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Enlargement.\nLast updated: 29.05.2008", "tags": ["accession to the European Union", "cooperation agreement (EU)", "Croatia", "accession criteria", "accession negotiations"], "subjects": ["External relations", "Cooperation", "Association Agreement"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32008D0119_p1": {"text": "Council decision 2008/119/ec of 12 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with Croatia and repealing decision 2006/145/ec.", "triples": [" decision 2008/119/ec,  repealing,  decision 2006/145/ec"]}}}
