{"celex_id": "32006L0066", "reference": "26.9.2006\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 266/1\nDIRECTIVE 2006/66/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 6 September 2006\non batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof and Article 95(1) thereof in relation to Articles 4, 6 and 21 of this Directive,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of Regions (3),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (4), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 22 June 2006,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIt is desirable to harmonise national measures concerning batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators. The primary objective of this Directive is to minimise the negative impact of batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators on the environment, thus contributing to the protection, preservation and improvement of the quality of the environment. The legal base is therefore Article 175(1) of the Treaty. However, it is also appropriate to take measures at Community level on the basis of Article 95(1) of the Treaty to harmonise requirements concerning the heavy metal content and labelling of batteries and accumulators and so to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market and avoid distortion of competition within the Community.\n(2)\nThe Commission Communication of 30 July 1996 on the Review of the Community Strategy for Waste Management established guidelines for future Community waste policy. That Communication stresses the need to reduce the quantities of hazardous substances in waste and points out the potential benefits of Community-wide rules limiting the presence of such substances in products and in production processes. It further states that, where the generation of waste cannot be avoided, that waste should be reused or recovered for its material or energy.\n(3)\nThe Council Resolution of 25 January 1988 on a Community action programme to combat environmental pollution by cadmium (5) stressed the limitation of the uses of cadmium to cases where suitable alternatives do not exist and the collection and recycling of batteries containing cadmium as major elements of the strategy for cadmium control in the interests of the protection of human health and the environment.\n(4)\nCouncil Directive 91/157/EEC of 18 March 1991 on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances (6) has brought about an approximation of Member States' laws in this field. However, the objectives of that Directive have not been fully attained. Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (7) and Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (8) also underlined the need for Directive 91/157/EEC to be revised. Directive 91/157/EEC should therefore be revised and replaced in the interests of clarity.\n(5)\nIn order to achieve its environmental aims, this Directive prohibits the placing on the market of certain batteries and accumulators containing mercury or cadmium. It also promotes a high level of collection and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators and improved environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators, e.g. producers, distributors and end-users and, in particular, those operators directly involved in the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators. The specific rules needed to do this are supplementary to existing Community legislation on waste, in particular Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (9), Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (10) and Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste (11).\n(6)\nIn order to prevent waste batteries and accumulators from being discarded in such a way as to pollute the environment, and to avoid end-user confusion about the different waste management requirements for different batteries and accumulators, this Directive should apply to all batteries and accumulators placed on the market within the Community. Such a wide scope should also ensure economies of scale in collection and recycling, as well as optimal resource saving.\n(7)\nReliable batteries and accumulators are fundamental for the safety of many products, appliances and services, and are an essential energy source in our society.\n(8)\nIt is appropriate to distinguish between portable batteries and accumulators on the one hand and industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators on the other. The disposal of industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators in landfill sites or by incineration should be prohibited.\n(9)\nExamples of industrial batteries and accumulators include batteries and accumulators used for emergency or back-up power supply in hospitals, airports or offices, batteries and accumulators used in trains or aircraft and batteries and accumulators used on offshore oil rigs or in lighthouses. Examples also include batteries and accumulators designed exclusively for hand-held payment terminals in shops and restaurants, bar code readers in shops, professional video equipment for TV channels and professional studios, miners' lamps and diving lamps attached to mining and diving helmets for professionals, back up batteries and accumulators for electric doors to prevent them from blocking or crushing people, batteries and accumulators used for instrumentation or in various types of measurement and instrumentation equipment and batteries and accumulators used in connection with solar panel, photo-voltaic, and other renewable energy applications. Industrial batteries and accumulators also include batteries and accumulators used in electrical vehicles, such as electric cars, wheelchairs, bicycles, airport vehicles and automatic transport vehicles. In addition to this non exhaustive list of examples, any battery or accumulator that is not sealed and not automotive should be considered industrial.\n(10)\nExamples of portable batteries and accumulators, which are all-sealed batteries and accumulators that an average person could carry by hand without difficulty and that are neither automotive batteries or accumulators nor industrial batteries or accumulators, include single cell batteries (such as AA and AAA batteries) and batteries and accumulators used by consumers or professionals in mobile telephones, portable computers, cordless power tools, toys and household appliances such as electric toothbrushes, razors and hand-held vacuum cleaners (including similar equipment used in schools, shops, restaurants, airports, offices or hospitals) and any battery or accumulator that consumers may use for normal household applications.\n(11)\nThe Commission should evaluate the need for adaptation of this Directive, taking account of available technical and scientific evidence. In particular, the Commission should carry out a review of the exemption from the cadmium ban provided for portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools. Examples of cordless power tools are tools that consumers and professionals use for turning, milling, sanding, grinding, sawing, cutting, shearing, drilling, making holes, punching, hammering, riveting, screwing, polishing or similar processing of wood, metal and other materials, as well as for mowing, cutting and other gardening activities.\n(12)\nThe Commission should also monitor, and Member States should encourage, technological developments that improve the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators throughout their entire life cycle, including through participation in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS).\n(13)\nIn order to protect the environment, waste batteries and accumulators should be collected. For portable batteries and accumulators, collection schemes achieving a high collection rate should be established. This means setting up collection schemes so that end-users can discard all waste portable batteries and accumulators conveniently and free of charge. Different collection schemes and financing arrangements are appropriate for the different battery and accumulator types.\n(14)\nIt is desirable for Member States to achieve a high collection and recycling rate for waste batteries and accumulators so as to achieve a high level of environmental protection and material recovery throughout the Community. This Directive should therefore set minimum collection and recycling targets for Member States. It is appropriate to calculate the collection rate on the basis of average annual sales in preceding years, so as to have comparable targets for all Member States that are proportionate to the national level of battery and accumulator consumption.\n(15)\nSpecific recycling requirements should be established for cadmium and lead batteries and accumulators in order to attain a high level of material recovery throughout the Community and to prevent disparities between Member States.\n(16)\nAll interested parties should be able to participate in collection, treatment and recycling schemes. Those schemes should be designed to avoid discrimination against imported batteries and accumulators, barriers to trade or distortions of competition.\n(17)\nCollection and recycling schemes should be optimised, in particular in order to minimise costs and the negative environmental impact of transport. Treatment and recycling schemes should use best available techniques, as defined in Article 2(11) of Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (12). The definition of recycling should exclude energy recovery. The concept of energy recovery is defined in other Community instruments.\n(18)\nBatteries and accumulators can be collected individually, by way of national battery collection schemes or together with waste electrical and electronic equipment, by way of national collection schemes set up on the basis of Directive 2002/96/EC. In the latter case, as an obligatory minimum treatment requirement, batteries and accumulators should be removed from the collected waste electrical and electronic equipment. After their removal from the waste electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators are subject to the requirements of this Directive, notably they count for achieving the collection target and are subject to recycling requirements.\n(19)\nBasic principles for financing the management of waste batteries and accumulators should be set at Community level. Financing schemes should help to achieve high collection and recycling rates and to give effect to the principle of producer responsibility. All producers as defined by this Directive should be registered. Producers should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries and accumulators minus the profit made by selling the materials recovered. However, under certain circumstances, the application of de minimis rules to small producers could be justified.\n(20)\nThe provision of information to end-users on the desirability of separate collection, the collection schemes available and end-users' role in the management of waste batteries and accumulators is necessary for successful collection. Detailed arrangements should be made for a labelling system, which should provide end-users with transparent, reliable and clear information on batteries and accumulators and any heavy metals they contain.\n(21)\nIf, in order to achieve the objectives of this Directive, and, in particular, to achieve high separate collection and recycling rates, Member States use economic instruments, such as differential tax rates, they should inform the Commission accordingly.\n(22)\nReliable and comparable data on the quantities of batteries and accumulators placed on the market collected and recycled are necessary for monitoring whether the objectives of this Directive have been achieved.\n(23)\nMember States should lay down rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(24)\nIn accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (13), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public.\n(25)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (14).\n(26)\nSince the objectives of this Directive namely protecting the environment and ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(27)\nThis Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation on safety, quality and health requirements and specific Community waste management legislation, in particular Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of-life vehicles (15) and Directive 2002/96/EC.\n(28)\nAs regards producer responsibility, producers of batteries and accumulators and producers of other products incorporating a battery or accumulator are responsible for the waste management of batteries and accumulators that they place on the market. A flexible approach is appropriate to enable financing schemes to reflect differing national circumstances and to take account of existing schemes, particularly those set up to comply with Directives 2000/53/EC and 2002/96/EC, while avoiding double charging.\n(29)\nDirective 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (16) does not apply to batteries and accumulators used in electrical and electronic equipment.\n(30)\nAutomotive and industrial batteries and accumulators used in vehicles should meet the requirements of Directive 2000/53/EC, in particular Article 4 thereof. Therefore the use of cadmium in industrial batteries and accumulators for electrical vehicles should be prohibited, unless they can benefit from an exemption on the basis of Annex II to that Directive,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject-matter\nThis Directive establishes:\n(1)\nrules regarding the placing on the market of batteries and accumulators and, in particular, a prohibition on the placing on the market of batteries and accumulators containing hazardous substances; and\n(2)\nspecific rules for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of waste batteries and accumulators to supplement relevant Community legislation on waste and to promote a high level of collection and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators.\nIt seeks to improve the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators and of the activities of all economic operators involved in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators, e.g. producers, distributors and end-users and, in particular, those operators directly involved in the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Appliances into which batteries and accumulators are incorporated shall be accompanied by instructions showing how they can be removed safely and, where appropriate, informing the end-user of the type of the incorporated batteries and accumulators. These provisions shall not apply where, for safety, performance, medical or data integrity reasons, continuity of power supply is necessary and requires a permanent connection between the appliance and the battery or accumulator.\nArticle 12\nTreatment and recycling\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, no later than 26 September 2009:\n(a)\nproducers or third parties set up schemes using best available techniques, in terms of the protection of health and the environment, to provide for the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators; and\n(b)\nall identifiable batteries and accumulators collected in accordance with Article 8 of this Directive or with Directive 2002/96/EC undergo treatment and recycling through schemes that comply, as a minimum, with Community legislation, in particular as regards health, safety and waste management.\nHowever, Member States may, in accordance with the Treaty, dispose of collected portable batteries or accumulators containing cadmium, mercury or lead in landfills or underground storage when no viable end market is available. Member States may also, in accordance with the Treaty, dispose of collected portable batteries or accumulators containing cadmium, mercury or lead in landfills or underground storage as part of a strategy to phase out heavy metals which, on the basis of a detailed assessment of the environmental, economic, and social impacts, shows that this disposal option should be preferred over recycling.\nMember States shall make public this assessment and notify draft measures to the Commission in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (20).\n2.   Treatment shall meet the minimum requirements set out in Annex III, Part A.\n3.   Where batteries or accumulators are collected together with waste electrical and electronic equipment on the basis of Directive 2002/96/EC, batteries or accumulators shall be removed from the collected waste electrical and electronic equipment.\n4.   Recycling processes shall, no later than 26 September 2010, meet the recycling efficiencies and associated provisions set out in Annex III, Part B.\n5.   Member States shall report on the levels of recycling achieved in each calendar year concerned and whether the efficiencies referred to in Annex III, Part B have been met. They shall submit the information to the Commission within six months of the end of the calendar year concerned.\n6.   Annex III may be adapted or supplemented to take account of technical or scientific progress in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2). In particular:\n(a)\ndetailed rules regarding the calculation of recycling efficiencies shall be added no later than 26 March 2010; and\n(b)\nthe minimum recycling efficiencies shall be evaluated regularly and adapted to best available techniques and in the light of the developments referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph.\n7.   Before proposing any amendment to Annex III the Commission shall consult relevant stakeholders, in particular producers, collectors, recyclers, treatment operators, environmental organisations, consumer organisations and employee associations. It shall inform the committee referred to in Article 24(1) of the outcome of this consultation.\nArticle 13\nNew recycling technologies\n1.   Member States shall encourage the development of new recycling and treatment technologies, and promote research into environmentally friendly and cost-effective recycling methods for all types of batteries and accumulators.\n2.   Member States shall encourage treatment facilities to introduce certified environmental management schemes in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) (21).\nArticle 14\nDisposal\nMember States shall prohibit the disposal in landfills or by incineration of waste industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators. However, residues of any batteries and accumulators that have undergone both treatment and recycling in accordance with Article 12(1) may be disposed of in landfills or by incineration.\nArticle 15\nExports\n1.   Treatment and recycling may be undertaken outside the Member State concerned or outside the Community, provided that the shipment of waste batteries and accumulators is in compliance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community (22).\n2.   Waste batteries and accumulators exported out of the Community in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, Council Regulation (EC) No 1420/1999 of 29 April 1999 establishing common rules and procedures to apply to shipments to certain non-OECD countries of certain types of waste (23) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1547/1999 of 12 July 1999 determining the control procedures under Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 to apply to shipments of certain types of waste to certain countries to which OECD Decision C(92)39 final does not apply (24) shall count towards the fulfilment of the obligations and efficiencies laid down in Annex III to this Directive only if there is sound evidence that the recycling operation took place under conditions equivalent to the requirements of this Directive.\n3.   Detailed rules for the implementation of this Article shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).\nArticle 16\nFinancing\n1.   Member States shall ensure that producers, or third parties acting on their behalf, finance any net costs arising from:\n(a)\nthe collection, treatment and recycling of all waste portable batteries and accumulators collected in accordance with Article 8(1) and (2); and\n(b)\nthe collection, treatment and recycling of all waste industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators collected in accordance with Articles 8(3) and (4).\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the implementation of paragraph 1 avoids any double charging of producers in the case of batteries or accumulators collected under schemes set up in accordance with Directive 2000/53/EC or Directive 2002/96/EC.\n3.   Member States shall oblige producers, or third parties acting on their behalf, to finance any net costs arising from public information campaigns on the collection, treatment and recycling of all waste portable batteries and accumulators.\n4.   The costs of collection, treatment and recycling shall not be shown separately to end-users at the time of sale of new portable batteries and accumulators.\n5.   Producers and users of industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators may conclude agreements stipulating financing arrangements other than the ones referred to in paragraph 1.\n6.   This Article shall apply to all waste batteries and accumulators, irrespective of the date of their placing on the market.\nArticle 17\nRegistration\nMember States shall ensure that each producer is registered. Registration shall be subject to the same procedural requirements in each Member State. Such requirements for registration shall be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).\nArticle 18\nSmall producers\n1.   Member States may exempt producers which, relative to the size of the national market place very small quantities of batteries or accumulators on the national market, from the requirements of Article 16(1), on the condition that this does not impede the proper functioning of the collection and recycling schemes set up on the basis of Articles 8 and 12.\n2.   Member States shall make public such draft measures and the grounds for proposing them and notify them to the Commission and other Member States through the Committee referred to in Article 24(1).\n3.   The Commission shall, within six months of notification as referred to in paragraph 2, approve or reject the draft measures after having verified that they are consistent with the considerations set out in paragraph 1 and do not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. In absence of a decision by the Commission within this period, the draft measures shall be deemed to have been approved.\nArticle 19\nParticipation\n1.   Member States shall ensure that all economic operators and all competent public authorities may participate in the collection, treatment and recycling schemes referred to in Articles 8 and 12.\n2.   These schemes shall also apply to batteries and accumulators imported from third countries under non-discriminatory conditions and shall be designed to avoid barriers to trade or distortions of competition.\nArticle 20\nInformation for end-users\n1.   Member States shall ensure, in particular through information campaigns, that end-users are fully informed of:\n(a)\nthe potential effects on the environment and human health of the substances used in batteries and accumulators;\n(b)\nthe desirability of not disposing of waste batteries and accumulators as unsorted municipal waste and of participating in their separate collection so as to facilitate treatment and recycling;\n(c)\nthe collection and recycling schemes available to them;\n(d)\ntheir role in contributing to the recycling of waste batteries and accumulators;\n(e)\nthe meaning of the symbol of the crossed-out wheeled bin shown in Annex II and the chemical symbols Hg, Cd and Pb.\n2.   Member States may require economic operators to provide some or all of the information referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   Where Member States require distributors to take back waste portable batteries and accumulators pursuant to Article 8, they shall ensure that such distributors inform end-users about the possibility of discarding waste portable batteries or accumulators at their sales points.\nArticle 21\nLabelling\n1.

It therefore covers a wider range of products than Directive 91/157/EEC, which applied only to batteries containing mercury, lead or cadmium, and excluded ‘button cells’, and which it repeals.\nAs regards the presence of mercury, the directive prohibits batteries, whether or not incorporated in appliances, containing more than 0.0005% by weight of mercury. Button cells with a mercury content of no more than 2% by weight were exempted from this prohibition until October 2015 (in the case of button cells for hearing aids, this exemption was, however, to remain under review by the European Commission).\nConcerning cadmium, portable batteries, including those incorporated in appliances, with a cadmium content by weight of more than 0.002% are prohibited (except for portable batteries for use in emergency and alarm systems or medical equipment). There was an exemption from this prohibition for portable batteries for cordless power tools until 31 December 2016, enabling the recycling industry and consumers along the whole value chain to further adapt to the relevant substitute technologies.\nTo ensure that a high proportion of spent batteries are recycled, EU countries must take whatever measures are needed (including economic instruments) to promote and maximise separate waste collections and prevent batteries being thrown away as unsorted municipal refuse. They have to make arrangements enabling end-users to discard spent batteries at collection points in their vicinity and have them taken back at no charge by the producers. Collection rates of at least 25% had to be reached by 26 September 2012 and 45% by 26 September 2016 respectively.\nAccording to Directive 2006/66/EC, as amended by Directive 2013/56/EU, it must be possible to remove batteries readily and safely. Thus, appliances incorporating batteries must be accompanied by instructions on how these can be safely removed by either the end-user or by independent qualified professionals.\nEU countries also have to ensure that batteries that have been collected are treated and recycled using best available techniques. Energy recovery is not considered a recycling process.\nAs a minimum, treatment must include removal of all fluids and acids. Batteries must be treated and stored (even if only temporarily) in sites with impermeable surfaces and weatherproof covering, or in suitable containers. The directive also establishes obligations in relation to the efficiencies of the recycling processes to which batteries are subject to, depending on their chemical composition.\nEU countries may dispose of waste portable batteries containing cadmium, mercury or lead in landfills or underground storage if there is no viable end-market for the recycling products, or if a detailed assessment of environmental, economic and social impact concludes that recycling is not the best solution. In addition, it is prohibited to put waste industrial and automotive batteries into landfill, or to incinerate it. However, residues of any batteries that have undergone both treatment and recycling may be disposed of in landfills or by incineration.\nTreatment and recycling may take place outside the EU country concerned or even outside the EU, provided that Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on the shipment of waste (see summary) is respected.\nProducers (or third parties acting on their behalf) have to bear the net cost of collecting, treating and recycling industrial, automotive and portable batteries. Producers of portable batteries have to finance the cost arising from public information campaigns on the collection, treatment and recycling of all waste portable batteries. Small producers may be exempted from this obligation if this does not impede the proper functioning of the collection and recycling schemes. All producers of batteries have to be registered.\nEnd-users must receive information on several subjects and through different channels: on the potential effects on the environment and human health of the substances used in batteries, and on the collection and recycling arrangements at their disposal, through campaigns or directly by distributors;on the capacity of the portable battery or on the presence of chemicals above a certain threshold, information will be given using visible, legible and indelible markings on batteries, accumulators and battery packs;on the need to ensure separate collection for batteries, the symbol of the crossed-out wheeled bin is to be used.\nEU countries must report to the Commission on the directive’s implementation and the measures they are taking to encourage developments affecting the impact of batteries on the environment (including new recycling and treatment techniques). Some aspects of the directive were reviewed in 2013 (see amending Directive 2013/56/EU).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\nDirective 2006/66/EC has applied since 26 September 2006 and had to become law in the EU countries by 26 September 2008.\nAmending Directive 2013/56/EU has applied since 30 December 2013 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 July 2015.\nBACKGROUND\nSeveral hundred thousand tonnes of industrial and portable batteries are placed on the EU market every year. A wide range of metals are used, from mercury, lead and cadmium to nickel, copper, zinc, manganese and lithium.\nDisposing of the waste from these products pollutes the atmosphere (in the case of incineration) and contaminates ground-cover and water (in the case of landfill or burial). With appropriate rules, it is possible to reduce the environmental pollution from this waste. In addition, recycling the waste enables the recovery of thousands of tonnes of metals, including precious metals like nickel, cobalt and silver.\nFor more information, see: Batteries and accumulators (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nBatteries or Accumulators: any source of electrical energy generated by direct conversion of chemical energy and consisting of one or more primary battery cells (non-rechargeable) or consisting of one or more secondary battery cells (rechargeable). In the context of this directive, batteries and accumulators are the same, for which only the word batteries is used.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC (OJ L 266, 26.9.2006, pp. 1-14)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2006/66/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
