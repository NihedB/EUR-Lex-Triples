In view of the overall positive experience with the application of that Regulation, which expires on 31 May 2010, and taking into account further experience acquired since its adoption, it is appropriate to adopt a new block exemption regulation.\n(3)\nThe category of agreements which can be regarded as normally satisfying the conditions laid down in Article 101(3) of the Treaty includes vertical agreements for the purchase or sale of goods or services where those agreements are concluded between non-competing undertakings, between certain competitors or by certain associations of retailers of goods. It also includes vertical agreements containing ancillary provisions on the assignment or use of intellectual property rights. The term ‘vertical agreements’ should include the corresponding concerted practices.\n(4)\nFor the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty by regulation, it is not necessary to define those vertical agreements which are capable of falling within Article 101(1) of the Treaty. In the individual assessment of agreements under Article 101(1) of the Treaty, account has to be taken of several factors, and in particular the market structure on the supply and purchase side.\n(5)\nThe benefit of the block exemption established by this Regulation should be limited to vertical agreements for which it can be assumed with sufficient certainty that they satisfy the conditions of Article 101(3) of the Treaty.\n(6)\nCertain types of vertical agreements can improve economic efficiency within a chain of production or distribution by facilitating better coordination between the participating undertakings. In particular, they can lead to a reduction in the transaction and distribution costs of the parties and to an optimisation of their sales and investment levels.\n(7)\nThe likelihood that such efficiency-enhancing effects will outweigh any anti-competitive effects due to restrictions contained in vertical agreements depends on the degree of market power of the parties to the agreement and, therefore, on the extent to which those undertakings face competition from other suppliers of goods or services regarded by their customers as interchangeable or substitutable for one another, by reason of the products' characteristics, their prices and their intended use.\n(8)\nIt can be presumed that, where the market share held by each of the undertakings party to the agreement on the relevant market does not exceed 30 %, vertical agreements which do not contain certain types of severe restrictions of competition generally lead to an improvement in production or distribution and allow consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits.\n(9)\nAbove the market share threshold of 30 %, there can be no presumption that vertical agreements falling within the scope of Article 101(1) of the Treaty will usually give rise to objective advantages of such a character and size as to compensate for the disadvantages which they create for competition. At the same time, there is no presumption that those vertical agreements are either caught by Article 101(1) of the Treaty or that they fail to satisfy the conditions of Article 101(3) of the Treaty.\n(10)\nThis Regulation should not exempt vertical agreements containing restrictions which are likely to restrict competition and harm consumers or which are not indispensable to the attainment of the efficiency-enhancing effects. In particular, vertical agreements containing certain types of severe restrictions of competition such as minimum and fixed resale-prices, as well as certain types of territorial protection, should be excluded from the benefit of the block exemption established by this Regulation irrespective of the market share of the undertakings concerned.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure access to or to prevent collusion on the relevant market, certain conditions should be attached to the block exemption. To this end, the exemption of non-compete obligations should be limited to obligations which do not exceed a defined duration. For the same reasons, any direct or indirect obligation causing the members of a selective distribution system not to sell the brands of particular competing suppliers should be excluded from the benefit of this Regulation.\n(12)\nThe market-share limitation, the non-exemption of certain vertical agreements and the conditions provided for in this Regulation normally ensure that the agreements to which the block exemption applies do not enable the participating undertakings to eliminate competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question.\n(13)\nThe Commission may withdraw the benefit of this Regulation, pursuant to Article 29(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (4), where it finds in a particular case that an agreement to which the exemption provided for in this Regulation applies nevertheless has effects which are incompatible with Article 101(3) of the Treaty.\n(14)\nThe competition authority of a Member State may withdraw the benefit of this Regulation pursuant to Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in respect of the territory of that Member State, or a part thereof where, in a particular case, an agreement to which the exemption provided for in this Regulation applies nevertheless has effects which are incompatible with Article 101(3) of the Treaty in the territory of that Member State, or in a part thereof, and where such territory has all the characteristics of a distinct geographic market.\n(15)\nIn determining whether the benefit of this Regulation should be withdrawn pursuant to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, the anti-competitive effects that may derive from the existence of parallel networks of vertical agreements that have similar effects which significantly restrict access to a relevant market or competition therein are of particular importance. Such cumulative effects may for example arise in the case of selective distribution or non compete obligations.\n(16)\nIn order to strengthen supervision of parallel networks of vertical agreements which have similar anti-competitive effects and which cover more than 50 % of a given market, the Commission may by regulation declare this Regulation inapplicable to vertical agreements containing specific restraints relating to the market concerned, thereby restoring the full application of Article 101 of the Treaty to such agreements,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘vertical agreement’ means an agreement or concerted practice entered into between two or more undertakings each of which operates, for the purposes of the agreement or the concerted practice, at a different level of the production or distribution chain, and relating to the conditions under which the parties may purchase, sell or resell certain goods or services;\n(b)\n‘vertical restraint’ means a restriction of competition in a vertical agreement falling within the scope of Article 101(1) of the Treaty;\n(c)\n‘competing undertaking’ means an actual or potential competitor; ‘actual competitor’ means an undertaking that is active on the same relevant market; ‘potential competitor’ means an undertaking that, in the absence of the vertical agreement, would, on realistic grounds and not just as a mere theoretical possibility, in case of a small but permanent increase in relative prices be likely to undertake, within a short period of time, the necessary additional investments or other necessary switching costs to enter the relevant market;\n(d)\n‘non-compete obligation’ means any direct or indirect obligation causing the buyer not to manufacture, purchase, sell or resell goods or services which compete with the contract goods or services, or any direct or indirect obligation on the buyer to purchase from the supplier or from another undertaking designated by the supplier more than 80 % of the buyer's total purchases of the contract goods or services and their substitutes on the relevant market, calculated on the basis of the value or, where such is standard industry practice, the volume of its purchases in the preceding calendar year;\n(e)\n‘selective distribution system’ means a distribution system where the supplier undertakes to sell the contract goods or services, either directly or indirectly, only to distributors selected on the basis of specified criteria and where these distributors undertake not to sell such goods or services to unauthorised distributors within the territory reserved by the supplier to operate that system;\n(f)\n‘intellectual property rights’ includes industrial property rights, know how, copyright and neighbouring rights;\n(g)\n‘know-how’ means a package of non-patented practical information, resulting from experience and testing by the supplier, which is secret, substantial and identified: in this context, ‘secret’ means that the know-how is not generally known or easily accessible; ‘substantial’ means that the know-how is significant and useful to the buyer for the use, sale or resale of the contract goods or services; ‘identified’ means that the know-how is described in a sufficiently comprehensive manner so as to make it possible to verify that it fulfils the criteria of secrecy and substantiality;\n(h)\n‘buyer’ includes an undertaking which, under an agreement falling within Article 101(1) of the Treaty, sells goods or services on behalf of another undertaking;\n(i)\n‘customer of the buyer’ means an undertaking not party to the agreement which purchases the contract goods or services from a buyer which is party to the agreement.\n2.   For the purposes of this Regulation, the terms ‘undertaking’, ‘supplier’ and ‘buyer’ shall include their respective connected undertakings.\n‘Connected undertakings’ means:\n(a)\nundertakings in which a party to the agreement, directly or indirectly:\n(i)\nhas the power to exercise more than half the voting rights, or\n(ii)\nhas the power to appoint more than half the members of the supervisory board, board of management or bodies legally representing the undertaking, or\n(iii)\nhas the right to manage the undertaking's affairs;\n(b)\nundertakings which directly or indirectly have, over a party to the agreement, the rights or powers listed in point (a);\n(c)\nundertakings in which an undertaking referred to in point (b) has, directly or indirectly, the rights or powers listed in point (a);\n(d)\nundertakings in which a party to the agreement together with one or more of the undertakings referred to in points (a), (b) or (c), or in which two or more of the latter undertakings, jointly have the rights or powers listed in point (a);\n(e)\nundertakings in which the rights or the powers listed in point (a) are jointly held by:\n(i)\nparties to the agreement or their respective connected undertakings referred to in points (a) to (d), or\n(ii)\none or more of the parties to the agreement or one or more of their connected undertakings referred to in points (a) to (d) and one or more third parties.\nArticle 2\nExemption\n1.   Pursuant to Article 101(3) of the Treaty and subject to the provisions of this Regulation, it is hereby declared that Article 101(1) of the Treaty shall not apply to vertical agreements.\nThis exemption shall apply to the extent that such agreements contain vertical restraints.\n2.   The exemption provided for in paragraph 1 shall apply to vertical agreements entered into between an association of undertakings and its members, or between such an association and its suppliers, only if all its members are retailers of goods and if no individual member of the association, together with its connected undertakings, has a total annual turnover exceeding EUR 50 million. Vertical agreements entered into by such associations shall be covered by this Regulation without prejudice to the application of Article 101 of the Treaty to horizontal agreements concluded between the members of the association or decisions adopted by the association.\n3.   The exemption provided for in paragraph 1 shall apply to vertical agreements containing provisions which relate to the assignment to the buyer or use by the buyer of intellectual property rights, provided that those provisions do not constitute the primary object of such agreements and are directly related to the use, sale or resale of goods or services by the buyer or its customers. The exemption applies on condition that, in relation to the contract goods or services, those provisions do not contain restrictions of competition having the same object as vertical restraints which are not exempted under this Regulation.\n4.   The exemption provided for in paragraph 1 shall not apply to vertical agreements entered into between competing undertakings. However, it shall apply where competing undertakings enter into a non-reciprocal vertical agreement and:\n(a)\nthe supplier is a manufacturer and a distributor of goods, while the buyer is a distributor and not a competing undertaking at the manufacturing level; or\n(b)\nthe supplier is a provider of services at several levels of trade, while the buyer provides its goods or services at the retail level and is not a competing undertaking at the level of trade where it purchases the contract services.\n5.   This Regulation shall not apply to vertical agreements the subject matter of which falls within the scope of any other block exemption regulation, unless otherwise provided for in such a regulation.\nArticle 3\nMarket share threshold\n1.   The exemption provided for in Article 2 shall apply on condition that the market share held by the supplier does not exceed 30 % of the relevant market on which it sells the contract goods or services and the market share held by the buyer does not exceed 30 % of the relevant market on which it purchases the contract goods or services.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, where in a multi party agreement an undertaking buys the contract goods or services from one undertaking party to the agreement and sells the contract goods or services to another undertaking party to the agreement, the market share of the first undertaking must respect the market share threshold provided for in that paragraph both as a buyer and a supplier in order for the exemption provided for in Article 2 to apply.\nArticle 4\nRestrictions that remove the benefit of the block exemption — hardcore restrictions\nThe exemption provided for in Article 2 shall not apply to vertical agreements which, directly or indirectly, in isolation or in combination with other factors under the control of the parties, have as their object:\n(a)\nthe restriction of the buyer's ability to determine its sale price, without prejudice to the possibility of the supplier to impose a maximum sale price or recommend a sale price, provided that they do not amount to a fixed or minimum sale price as a result of pressure from, or incentives offered by, any of the parties;\n(b)\nthe restriction of the territory into which, or of the customers to whom, a buyer party to the agreement, without prejudice to a restriction on its place of establishment, may sell the contract goods or services, except:\n(i)\nthe restriction of active sales into the exclusive territory or to an exclusive customer group reserved to the supplier or allocated by the supplier to another buyer, where such a restriction does not limit sales by the customers of the buyer,\n(ii)\nthe restriction of sales to end users by a buyer operating at the wholesale level of trade,\n(iii)\nthe restriction of sales by the members of a selective distribution system to unauthorised distributors within the territory reserved by the supplier to operate that system, and\n(iv)\nthe restriction of the buyer's ability to sell components, supplied for the purposes of incorporation, to customers who would use them to manufacture the same type of goods as those produced by the supplier;\n(c)\nthe restriction of active or passive sales to end users by members of a selective distribution system operating at the retail level of trade, without prejudice to the possibility of prohibiting a member of the system from operating out of an unauthorised place of establishment;\n(d)\nthe restriction of cross-supplies between distributors within a selective distribution system, including between distributors operating at different level of trade;\n(e)\nthe restriction, agreed between a supplier of components and a buyer who incorporates those components, of the supplier’s ability to sell the components as spare parts to end-users or to repairers or other service providers not entrusted by the buyer with the repair or servicing of its goods.\nArticle 5\nExcluded restrictions\n1.   The exemption provided for in Article 2 shall not apply to the following obligations contained in vertical agreements:\n(a)\nany direct or indirect non-compete obligation, the duration of which is indefinite or exceeds five years;\n(b)\nany direct or indirect obligation causing the buyer, after termination of the agreement, not to manufacture, purchase, sell or resell goods or services;\n(c)\nany direct or indirect obligation causing the members of a selective distribution system not to sell the brands of particular competing suppliers.\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, a non-compete obligation which is tacitly renewable beyond a period of five years shall be deemed to have been concluded for an indefinite duration.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1(a), the time limitation of five years shall not apply where the contract goods or services are sold by the buyer from premises and land owned by the supplier or leased by the supplier from third parties not connected with the buyer, provided that the duration of the non-compete obligation does not exceed the period of occupancy of the premises and land by the buyer.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1(b), the exemption provided for in Article 2 shall apply to any direct or indirect obligation causing the buyer, after termination of the agreement, not to manufacture, purchase, sell or resell goods or services where the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe obligation relates to goods or services which compete with the contract goods or services;\n(b)\nthe obligation is limited to the premises and land from which the buyer has operated during the contract period;\n(c)\nthe obligation is indispensable to protect know-how transferred by the supplier to the buyer;\n(d)\nthe duration of the obligation is limited to a period of one year after termination of the agreement.\nParagraph 1(b) is without prejudice to the possibility of imposing a restriction which is unlimited in time on the use and disclosure of know-how which has not entered the public domain.\nArticle 6\nNon-application of this Regulation\nPursuant to Article 1a of Regulation No 19/65/EEC, the Commission may by regulation declare that, where parallel networks of similar vertical restraints cover more than 50 % of a relevant market, this Regulation shall not apply to vertical agreements containing specific restraints relating to that market.\nArticle 7\nApplication of the market share threshold\nFor the purposes of applying the market share thresholds provided for in Article 3 the following rules shall apply:\n(a)\nthe market share of the supplier shall be calculated on the basis of market sales value data and the market share of the buyer shall be calculated on the basis of market purchase value data. If market sales value or market purchase value data are not available, estimates based on other reliable market information, including market sales and purchase volumes, may be used to establish the market share of the undertaking concerned;\n(b)\nthe market shares shall be calculated on the basis of data relating to the preceding calendar year;\n(c)\nthe market share of the supplier shall include any goods or services supplied to vertically integrated distributors for the purposes of sale;\n(d)\nif a market share is initially not more than 30 % but subsequently rises above that level without exceeding 35 %, the exemption provided for in Article 2 shall continue to apply for a period of two consecutive calendar years following the year in which the 30 % market share threshold was first exceeded;\n(e)\nif a market share is initially not more than 30 % but subsequently rises above 35 %, the exemption provided for in Article 2 shall continue to apply for one calendar year following the year in which the level of 35 % was first exceeded;\n(f)\nthe benefit of points (d) and (e) may not be combined so as to exceed a period of two calendar years;\n(g)\nthe market share held by the undertakings referred to in point (e) of the second subparagraph of Article 1(2) shall be apportioned equally to each undertaking having the rights or the powers listed in point (a) of the second subparagraph of Article 1(2).\nArticle 8\nApplication of the turnover threshold\n1.   For the purpose of calculating total annual turnover within the meaning of Article 2(2), the turnover achieved during the previous financial year by the relevant party to the vertical agreement and the turnover achieved by its connected undertakings in respect of all goods and services, excluding all taxes and other duties, shall be added together. For this purpose, no account shall be taken of dealings between the party to the vertical agreement and its connected undertakings or between its connected undertakings.\n2.   The exemption provided for in Article 2 shall remain applicable where, for any period of two consecutive financial years, the total annual turnover threshold is exceeded by no more than 10 %.\nArticle 9\nTransitional period\nThe prohibition laid down in Article 101(1) of the Treaty shall not apply during the period from 1 June 2010 to 31 May 2011 in respect of agreements already in force on 31 May 2010 which do not satisfy the conditions for exemption provided for in this Regulation but which, on 31 May 2010, satisfied the conditions for exemption provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2790/1999.\nArticle 10\nPeriod of validity\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 June 2010.\nIt shall expire on 31 May 2022.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 20 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJosé Manuel BARROSO\n(1)  OJ 36, 6.3.1965, p. 533.\n(2)  With effect from 1 December 2009, Article 81 of the EC Treaty has become Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The two Articles are, in substance, identical. For the purposes of this Regulation, references to Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be understood as references to Article 81 of the EC Treaty where appropriate.\n(3)  OJ L 336, 29.12.1999, p. 21.\n(4)  OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 1.", "summary": "Exemption for vertical supply and distribution agreements\nExemption for vertical supply and distribution agreements\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 330/2010 — application of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices\nArticle 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION AND OF ARTICLE 101 TFEU?\n              \nArticle 101(1) TFEU prohibits agreements that may affect trade between EU countries and which prevent, restrict or distort competition. However, agreements which create sufficient benefits to outweigh the anti-competitive effects are exempt from this prohibition under Article 101(3) TFEU.\nThe regulation gives a block exemption from Article 101(1) TFEU to vertical agreements* which fulfil certain requirements. These agreements may, for instance, help a manufacturer to enter a new market, or avoid the situation whereby one distributor ‘free rides’ on the promotional efforts of another distributor, or allow a supplier to depreciate an investment made for a particular client.\nKEY POINTS\nRequirements for application of the regulation\nCertain requirements must be fulfilled before a particular vertical agreement is exempt from Article 101(1) TFEU:\nthe agreement does not contain any of the ‘hardcore’ restrictions set out in the regulation;\nthere must be a market share cap of 30% for both suppliers and buyers;\nthe regulation contains conditions relating to 3 specific restrictions.\n‘Hardcore’ restrictions\nThere are 5 restrictions that lead to the exclusion of the whole agreement from the benefit of the regulation, even if the market shares of the supplier and buyer are below 30%. They are considered to be severe restrictions of competition because of the likely harm they cause to consumers. In most cases they will be prohibited and it is considered unlikely that vertical agreements containing them fulfil the conditions of Article 101(3) TFEU:\n1.suppliers are not allowed to fix the (minimum) price at which distributors can resell their products (resale price maintenance);\n2.market-partitioning by territory or by customer is prohibited. Distributors must remain free to decide where and to whom they sell. The regulation contains exceptions to this rule, which, for instance, enable companies to operate an exclusive distribution system or a selective distribution system;\n3.selected distributors, while being prohibited to sell to unauthorised distributors, cannot be restricted in the end-users to whom they may sell;\n4.selected distributors must remain free to sell or purchase the contract goods to or from other selected distributors within the network;\n5.an agreement between a manufacturer of spare parts and a buyer which incorporates these parts into its own products may not prevent or restrict sales by the manufacturer of these spare parts to end-users, independent repairers or service providers.\nThe 30% market share cap\nA vertical agreement is covered by this regulation if neither the supplier nor the buyer of the goods or services has a market share exceeding 30%. For the supplier, it is its market share on the relevant supply market, i.e. the market on which it sells the goods or services that is decisive for the application of the block exemption. For the buyer, it is its market share on the relevant purchase market, i.e. the market on which it purchases the goods or services, which is decisive for the application of the regulation.\nThe excluded restrictions\nThe regulation applies to all vertical restraints other than those mentioned above. However, it does impose specific conditions on 3 vertical restraints:\nobligations not to compete during the contract;\nobligations not to compete after termination of the contract;\nthe exclusion of specific brands in a selective distribution system.\nWhen these conditions are not fulfilled, these vertical restraints are excluded from the exemption by the regulation. However, the regulation continues to apply to the remaining part of the vertical agreement if that part can operate independently from the non-exempted vertical restraints.The European Commission has also published guidelines on vertical restraints. These describe the approach taken towards vertical agreements not covered by the regulation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 June 2010 and will expire on 31 May 2022.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nVertical agreements (European Commission)\nAntitrust: Commission adopts revised competition rules for vertical agreements: frequently asked questions (European Commission).\n            \nFollowing the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted: Communication from the Commission — Temporary Framework for assessing antitrust issues related to business cooperation in response to situations of urgency stemming from the current COVID-19 outbreak\nKEY TERMS\n              \nVertical agreements: agreements for the sale and purchase of goods or services between companies operating at different levels of the production or distribution chain, for example, distribution agreements between manufacturers and wholesalers or retailers.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 330/2010 of 20 April 2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices (OJ L 102, 23.4.2010, pp. 1-7)\nConsolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union — Part Three — Union policies and internal actions — Title VII — Common rules on competition, taxation and approximation of laws — Chapter 1 — Rules on competition — Section 1 — Rules applying to undertakings — Article 101 (ex Article 81 TEC) (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, pp. 88-89)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nGuidelines on Vertical Restraints (OJ C 130, 19.5.2010, pp. 1-46)\nlast update 08.05.2020", "tags": ["application of EU law", "competition policy", "industrial property", "restriction on competition", "inter-company agreement"], "subjects": ["Agreements, decisions and concerted practices", "Competition"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
