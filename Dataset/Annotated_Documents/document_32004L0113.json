{"celex_id": "32004L0113", "reference": "21.12.2004\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 373/37\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2004/113/EC\nof 13 December 2004\nimplementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 13(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States, and respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States as general principles of Community law.\n(2)\nThe right to equality before the law and protection against discrimination for all persons constitutes a universal right recognised by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination and the United Nations Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which all Member States are signatories.\n(3)\nWhile prohibiting discrimination, it is important to respect other fundamental rights and freedoms, including the protection of private and family life and transactions carried out in that context and the freedom of religion.\n(4)\nEquality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibit any discrimination on grounds of sex and require equality between men and women to be ensured in all areas.\n(5)\nArticle 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides that promoting such equality is one of the Community's essential tasks. Similarly, Article 3(2) of the Treaty requires the Community to aim to eliminate inequalities and to promote equality between men and women in all its activities.\n(6)\nThe Commission announced its intention of proposing a directive on sex discrimination outside of the labour market in its Communication on the Social Policy Agenda. Such a proposal is fully consistent with Council Decision 2001/51/EC of 20 December 2000 establishing a Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) (4) covering all Community policies and aimed at promoting equality for men and women by adjusting these policies and implementing practical measures to improve the situation of men and women in society.\n(7)\nAt its meeting in Nice of 7 and 9 December 2000, the European Council called on the Commission to reinforce equality-related rights by adopting a proposal for a directive on promoting gender equality in areas other than employment and professional life.\n(8)\nThe Community has adopted a range of legal instruments to prevent and combat sex discrimination in the labour market. These instruments have demonstrated the value of legislation in the fight against discrimination.\n(9)\nDiscrimination based on sex, including harassment and sexual harassment, also takes place in areas outside of the labour market. Such discrimination can be equally damaging, acting as a barrier to the full and successful integration of men and women into economic and social life.\n(10)\nProblems are particularly apparent in the area of the access to and supply of goods and services. Discrimination based on sex, should therefore be prevented and eliminated in this area. As in the case of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin (5), this objective can be better achieved by means of Community legislation.\n(11)\nSuch legislation should prohibit discrimination based on sex in the access to and supply of goods and services. Goods should be taken to be those within the meaning of the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community relating to the free movement of goods. Services should be taken to be those within the meaning of Article 50 of that Treaty.\n(12)\nTo prevent discrimination based on sex, this Directive should apply to both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs only when one person is treated less favourably, on grounds of sex, than another person in a comparable situation. Accordingly, for example, differences between men and women in the provision of healthcare services, which result from the physical differences between men and women, do not relate to comparable situations and therefore, do not constitute discrimination.\n(13)\nThe prohibition of discrimination should apply to persons providing goods and services, which are available to the public and which are offered outside the area of private and family life and the transactions carried out in this context. It should not apply to the content of media or advertising nor to public or private education.\n(14)\nAll individuals enjoy the freedom to contract, including the freedom to choose a contractual partner for a transaction. An individual who provides goods or services may have a number of subjective reasons for his or her choice of contractual partner. As long as the choice of partner is not based on that person's sex, this Directive should not prejudice the individual's freedom to choose a contractual partner.\n(15)\nThere are already a number of existing legal instruments for the implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of employment and occupation. Therefore, this Directive should not apply in this field. The same reasoning applies to matters of self-employment insofar as they are covered by existing legal instruments. The Directive should apply only to insurance and pensions which are private, voluntary and separate from the employment relationship.\n(16)\nDifferences in treatment may be accepted only if they are justified by a legitimate aim. A legitimate aim may, for example, be the protection of victims of sex-related violence (in cases such as the establishment of single-sex shelters), reasons of privacy and decency (in cases such as the provision of accommodation by a person in a part of that person's home), the promotion of gender equality or of the interests of men or women (for example single-sex voluntary bodies), the freedom of association (in cases of membership of single-sex private clubs), and the organisation of sporting activities (for example single-sex sports events). Any limitation should nevertheless be appropriate and necessary in accordance with the criteria derived from case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.\n(17)\nThe principle of equal treatment in the access to goods and services does not require that facilities should always be provided to men and women on a shared basis, as long as they are not provided more favourably to members of one sex.\n(18)\nThe use of actuarial factors related to sex is widespread in the provision of insurance and other related financial services. In order to ensure equal treatment between men and women, the use of sex as an actuarial factor should not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits. To avoid a sudden readjustment of the market, the implementation of this rule should apply only to new contracts concluded after the date of transposition of this Directive.\n(19)\nCertain categories of risks may vary between the sexes. In some cases, sex is one but not necessarily the only determining factor in the assessment of risks insured. For contracts insuring those types of risks, Member States may decide to permit exemptions from the rule of unisex premiums and benefits, as long as they can ensure that underlying actuarial and statistical data on which the calculations are based, are reliable, regularly up-dated and available to the public. Exemptions are allowed only where national legislation has not already applied the unisex rule. Five years after transposition of this Directive, Member States should re-examine the justification for these exemptions, taking into account the most recent actuarial and statistical data and a report by the Commission three years after the date of transposition of this Directive.\n(20)\nLess favourable treatment of women for reasons of pregnancy and maternity should be considered a form of direct discrimination based on sex and therefore prohibited in insurance and related financial services. Costs related to risks of pregnancy and maternity should therefore not be attributed to the members of one sex only.\n(21)\nPersons who have been subject to discrimination based on sex should have adequate means of legal protection. To provide a more effective level of protection, associations, organisations and other legal entities should also be empowered to engage in proceedings, as the Member States so determine, either on behalf or in support of any victim, without prejudice to national rules of procedure concerning representation and defence before the courts.\n(22)\nThe rules on the burden of proof should be adapted when there is a prima facie case of discrimination and for the principle of equal treatment to be applied effectively, the burden of proof should shift back to the defendant when evidence of such discrimination is brought.\n(23)\nThe effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment requires adequate judicial protection against victimisation.\n(24)\nWith a view to promoting the principle of equal treatment, Member States should encourage dialogue with relevant stakeholders, which have, in accordance with national law and practice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of sex in the area of access to and supply of goods and services.\n(25)\nProtection against discrimination based on sex should itself be strengthened by the existence of a body or bodies in each Member State, with competence to analyse the problems involved, to study possible solutions and to provide concrete assistance for the victims. The body or bodies may be the same as those with responsibility at national level for the defence of human rights or the safeguarding of individuals' rights, or the implementation of the principle of equal treatment.\n(26)\nThis Directive lays down minimum requirements, thus giving the Member States the option of introducing or maintaining more favourable provisions. The implementation of this Directive should not serve to justify any regression in relation to the situation, which already prevails in each Member State.\n(27)\nMember States should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in cases of breaches of the obligations under this Directive.\n(28)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely to ensure a common high level of protection against discrimination in all the Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(29)\nIn accordance with paragraph 34 of the interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (6), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between the Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Directive is to lay down a framework for combating discrimination based on sex in access to and supply of goods and services, with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment between men and women.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\ndirect discrimination: where one person is treated less favourably, on grounds of sex, than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation;\n(b)\nindirect discrimination: where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary;\n(c)\nharassment: where an unwanted conduct related to the sex of a person occurs with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment;\n(d)\nsexual harassment: where any form of unwanted physical, verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\nArticle 3\nScope\n1.   Within the limits of the powers conferred upon the Community, this Directive shall apply to all persons who provide goods and services, which are available to the public irrespective of the person concerned as regards both the public and private sectors, including public bodies, and which are offered outside the area of private and family life and the transactions carried out in this context.\n2.   This Directive does not prejudice the individual's freedom to choose a contractual partner as long as an individual's choice of contractual partner is not based on that person's sex.\n3.   This Directive shall not apply to the content of media and advertising nor to education.\n4.   This Directive shall not apply to matters of employment and occupation. This Directive shall not apply to matters of self-employment, insofar as these matters are covered by other Community legislative acts.\nArticle 4\nPrinciple of equal treatment\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive, the principle of equal treatment between men and women shall mean that\n(a)\nthere shall be no direct discrimination based on sex, including less favourable treatment of women for reasons of pregnancy and maternity;\n(b)\nthere shall be no indirect discrimination based on sex.\n2.   This Directive shall be without prejudice to more favourable provisions concerning the protection of women as regards pregnancy and maternity.\n3.   Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited. A person's rejection of, or submission to, such conduct may not be used as a basis for a decision affecting that person.\n4.   Instruction to direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex shall be deemed to be discrimination within the meaning of this Directive.\n5.   This Directive shall not preclude differences in treatment, if the provision of the goods and services exclusively or primarily to members of one sex is justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.\nArticle 5\nActuarial factors\n1.   Member States shall ensure that in all new contracts concluded after 21 December 2007 at the latest, the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for the purposes of insurance and related financial services shall not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member States may decide before 21 December 2007 to permit proportionate differences in individuals' premiums and benefits where the use of sex is a determining factor in the assessment of risk based on relevant and accurate actuarial and statistical data. The Member States concerned shall inform the Commission and ensure that accurate data relevant to the use of sex as a determining actuarial factor are compiled, published and regularly updated. These Member States shall review their decision five years after 21 December 2007, taking into account the Commission report referred to in Article 16, and shall forward the results of this review to the Commission.\n3.   In any event, costs related to pregnancy and maternity shall not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits.\nMember States may defer implementation of the measures necessary to comply with this paragraph until two years after 21 December 2007 at the latest. In that case the Member States concerned shall immediately inform the Commission.\nArticle 6\nPositive action\nWith a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to sex.\nArticle 7\nMinimum requirements\n1.   Member States may introduce or maintain provisions which are more favourable to the protection of the principle of equal treatment between men and women than those laid down in this Directive.\n2.   The implementation of this Directive shall in no circumstances constitute grounds for a reduction in the level of protection against discrimination already afforded by Member States in the fields covered by this Directive.\nCHAPTER II\nREMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT\nArticle 8\nDefence of rights\n1.   Member States shall ensure that judicial and/or administrative procedures, including where they deem it appropriate conciliation procedures, for the enforcement of the obligations under this Directive are available to all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them, even after the relationship in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred has ended.\n2.   Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to ensure real and effective compensation or reparation, as the Member States so determine, for the loss and damage sustained by a person injured as a result of discrimination within the meaning of this Directive, in a way which is dissuasive and proportionate to the damage suffered. The fixing of a prior upper limit shall not restrict such compensation or reparation.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that associations, organisations or other legal entities, which have, in accordance with the criteria laid down by their national law, a legitimate interest in ensuring that the provisions of this Directive are complied with, may engage, on behalf or in support of the complainant, with his or her approval, in any judicial and/or administrative procedure provided for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive.\n4.   Paragraphs 1 and 3 shall be without prejudice to national rules on time limits for bringing actions relating to the principle of equal treatment.\nArticle 9\nBurden of proof\n1.   Member States shall take such measures as are necessary, in accordance with their national judicial systems, to ensure that, when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not prevent Member States from introducing rules of evidence, which are more favourable to plaintiffs.\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to criminal procedures.\n4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to any proceedings brought in accordance with Article 8(3).\n5.   Member States need not apply paragraph 1 to proceedings in which it is for the court or other competent authority to investigate the facts of the case.\nArticle 10\nVictimisation\nMember States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to protect persons from any adverse treatment or adverse consequence as a reaction to a complaint or to legal proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment.\nArticle 11\nDialogue with relevant stakeholders\nWith a view to promoting the principle of equal treatment, Member States shall encourage dialogue with relevant stakeholders which have, in accordance with national law and practice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of sex in the area of access to and supply of goods and services.\nCHAPTER III\nBODIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF EQUAL TREATMENT\nArticle 12\n1.   Member States shall designate and make the necessary arrangements for a body or bodies for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of sex. These bodies may form part of agencies charged at national level with the defence of human rights or the safeguard of individuals' rights, or the implementation of the principle of equal treatment.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the competencies of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1 include:\n(a)\nwithout prejudice to the rights of victims and of associations, organisations or other legal entities referred to in Article 8(3), providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints about discrimination;\n(b)\nconducting independent surveys concerning discrimination;\n(c)\npublishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to such discrimination.\nCHAPTER IV\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 13\nCompliance\nMember States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the principle of equal treatment is respected in relation to the access to and supply of goods and services within the scope of this Directive, and in particular that:\n(a)\nany laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment are abolished;\n(b)\nany contractual provisions, internal rules of undertakings, and rules governing profit-making or non-profit-making associations contrary to the principle of equal treatment are, or may be, declared null and void or are amended.\nArticle 14\nPenalties\nMember States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are applied. The penalties, which may comprise the payment of compensation to the victim, shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Member States shall notify those provisions to the Commission by 21 December 2007 at the latest and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.\nArticle 15\nDissemination of information\nMember States shall take care that the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, together with the relevant provisions already in force, are brought to the attention of the persons concerned by all appropriate means throughout their territory.\nArticle 16\nReports\n1.   Member States shall communicate all available information concerning the application of this Directive to the Commission, by 21 December 2009. and every five years thereafter.\nThe Commission shall draw up a summary report, which shall include a review of the current practices of Member States in relation to Article 5 with regard to the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits. It shall submit this report to the European Parliament and to the Council no later 21 December 2010. Where appropriate, the Commission shall accompany its report with proposals to modify the Directive.\n2.   The Commission's report shall take into account the viewpoints of relevant stakeholders.\nArticle 17\nTransposition\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 21 December 2007 at the latest. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such publication of reference shall be laid down by the Member States.\n2.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\nArticle 18\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 19\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 13 December 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nB. R. BOT\n(1)  Opinion delivered on 30 March 2004 (not yet published in the Official Journal).\n(2)  OJ C 241, 28.9.2004, p. 44.\n(3)  OJ C 121, 30.4.2004, p. 27.\n(4)  OJ L 17, 19.1.2001, p. 22.\n(5)  OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22.\n(6)  OJ C 321, 31.12.2003, p. 1.", "summary": "Principle of equal treatment of men and women outside the employment market\nPrinciple of equal treatment of men and women outside the employment market\nThe directive aims to implement equal treatment of men and women with a view to extending the principle of equal treatment beyond the sphere of the employment market and professional life to other areas of everyday life.\nACT\n                  \nCouncil Directive 2004/113/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services.\nSUMMARY\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS DIRECTIVE?\n                     \nThe directive establishes a framework for combatting all gender discrimination in access and supply of goods and services, in both the public and private sectors.\nThe directive applies to goods and services offered to the public, regardless of the persons concerned (that is to say, whatever the personal circumstances of the service recipient) and which are offered outside of the private and family spheres. The term ‘services’ indicates services provided in exchange for remuneration.\nThe directive does not apply to either the content of media or advertising, or education.\nKEY ASPECTS\nBan on discrimination in the field of goods and services: in principle, the directive prohibits:\nany less favourable treatment of men or women by reason of their gender;\nany less favourable treatment of women due to pregnancy or maternity;\nharassment, sexual harassment or any incitement to discriminate with regard to the offer or supply of goods or services.\nDifferential treatment can only be accepted if it is justified by a legitimate objective such as, for example protection of victims of sexual abuse (in the case of creating women’s refuges), freedom of association (in the context of membership of unisex private clubs) or organisation of unisex sporting activities. Any limitation must be appropriate and necessary.\nThe principle of equal treatment does not preclude taking affirmative action to prevent or compensate for gender inequalities in the area of goods and services.\nThe directive establishes only minimal requirements to allow EU countries to be able to maintain higher or more extensive levels of protection.\nApplication to the field of insurance: the directive prohibits taking gender into consideration when calculating insurance premiums and benefits in insurance agreements signed after 21 December 2007.\nNonetheless, the directive provided for the option for EU countries not to apply this prohibition in cases where gender was a determining factor in risk assessment and based on relevant actuarial and statistical data. However, the Court of Justice of the European Union, in its ruling on the Test-Achats case (C-236/09) declared invalid the derogation from the principle of equal treatment which allowed EU countries to differentiate between men and women with regard to insurance premiums and benefits, with effect from 21 December 2012.\nHenceforth, for all new agreements signed since this date, the principle of a unisex tariff applies to the insurance sector. In order to facilitate implementation of the Court’s ruling, the Commission adopted Guidelines on the application of the directive to the insurance sector.\nIn any case, the costs associated with pregnancy and maternity must not lead to differences in terms of premiums and benefits.\nBodies promoting equal treatment: each EU country charges one or several bodies with promoting and monitoring equal treatment of men and women at national level. These bodies are responsible for (i) offering victims independent assistance, (ii) carrying out independent studies, (iii) publishing independent reports and making recommendations.\nDefending victims’rights: the directive obligates EU countries to ensure that victims have access to a judicial and/or administrative procedure to safeguard their rights, and that victims can obtain the appropriate reparation or compensation. Associations, organisations and other legal persons with a legitimate interest are also able to engage in a judicial and/or administrative procedure to allow victims to safeguard their rights and to obtain reparation or compensation.\nWhen facts presented before a tribunal support the presumption of the existence of discrimination, it falls to the defendant to prove that there has been no infringement of the principle of equal treatment (rebuttal of the charge).\nFurthermore, EU countries must put in place sanctions in case of infringement of the principle of equal treatment.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n                     \nThe directive came into force on 21 December 2004 and it should have been transposed into EU country law by 21 December 2007 at the latest.\nCONTEXT\n                     \nEquality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union, laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union. Gender discrimination may constitute an obstacle to full and successful integration of men and women into economic and social life.\nKEY TERMINOLOGY\nDirect discrimination: circumstances in which a person is treated less favourably, by reason of their gender, than another person who, in a similar situation, is not, has not been or would not be.\nIndirect discrimination: circumstances in which an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice is likely to lead to a specific disadvantage for persons of the opposite sex, unless this provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate objective and the means of realising this objective are appropriate and necessary.\nHarassment: circumstances in which unwanted conduct related to a person’s gender takes place, with the aim or effect of attacking the person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\nSexual harassment: circumstances in which unwanted sexual conduct, expressed physically, verbally or non-verbally, takes place, with the aim or effect of attacking the person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nTransposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2004/113/EC\n21.12.2004\n21.12.2007\nOJ L 373, 21.12.2004, pp.37-43\nlast update 26.02.2015", "tags": ["service industry", "financial institution", "provision of services", "insurance company", "gender equality", "sexual discrimination", "equal treatment"], "subjects": ["Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Anti-discrimination", "Social provisions", "Approximation of laws"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
