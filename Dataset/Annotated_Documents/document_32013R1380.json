{"celex_id": "32013R1380", "reference": "28.12.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 354/22\nREGULATION (EU) No 1380/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 December 2013\non the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 2004/585/EC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 (4) established a Community system for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).\n(2)\nThe scope of the CFP includes the conservation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries targeting them. In addition, it includes, in relation to market measures and financial measures in support of its objectives, fresh water biological resources and aquaculture activities, as well as the processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products, where such activities take place on the territory of Member States or in Union waters, including by fishing vessels flying the flag of, and registered in, third countries, by Union fishing vessels, or by nationals of Member States, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag State, bearing in mind the provisions of Article 117 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (5) (UNCLOS).\n(3)\nRecreational fisheries can have a significant impact on fish resources and Member States should, therefore, ensure that they are conducted in a manner that is compatible with the objectives of the CFP.\n(4)\nThe CFP should ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities contribute to long-term environmental, economic, and social sustainability. It should include rules that aim to ensure the traceability, security and quality of products marketed in the Union. Furthermore, the CFP should contribute to increased productivity, to a fair standard of living for the fisheries sector including small-scale fisheries, and to stable markets, and it should ensure the availability of food supplies and that they reach consumers at reasonable prices. The CFP should contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and should help to achieve the objectives set out therein.\n(5)\nThe Union is a contracting party to UNCLOS (6) and, pursuant to Council Decision 98/414/EC (7), to the United Nations Agreement on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks of 4 December 1995 (8) (UN Fish Stocks Agreement) and, pursuant to Council Decision 96/428/EC (9), to the Agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas of 24 November 1993 of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (10).\n(6)\nThose international instruments predominantly lay down conservation obligations, including obligations to take conservation and management measures designed to maintain or restore marine resources at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield both within sea areas under national jurisdiction and on the high seas, and to cooperate with other States to that end, obligations to apply the precautionary approach widely to conservation, management and exploitation of fish stocks, obligations to ensure compatibility of conservation and management measures where marine resources occur in sea areas of different jurisdictional status and obligations to have due regard to other legitimate uses of the seas. The CFP should, therefore, contribute to the Union's implementation of its international obligations under those international instruments. Where Member States adopt conservation and management measures, for which they have been empowered within the framework of the CFP, they should also act in a manner which is fully consistent with the international obligations regarding conservation and cooperation under those international instruments.\n(7)\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002, the Union and its Member States committed themselves to act against the continued decline of many fish stocks. Therefore, the Union should improve the CFP by adapting exploitation rates so as to ensure that, within a reasonable time-frame, the exploitation of marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested stocks above levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. The exploitation rates should be achieved by 2015. Achieving those exploitation rates by a later date should be allowed only if achieving them by 2015 would seriously jeopardise the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleets involved. After 2015, those rates should be achieved as soon as possible and in any event no later than 2020. Where scientific information is insufficient to determine those levels, approximative parameters may be considered.\n(8)\nManagement decisions relating to maximum sustainable yield in mixed fisheries should take into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at maximum sustainable yield at the same time, in particular where scientific advice indicates that it is very difficult to avoid the phenomenon of \"choke species\" by increasing the selectivity of the fishing gears used. Appropriate scientific bodies should be requested to provide advice on the appropriate fishing mortality levels in such circumstances.\n(9)\nThe CFP should ensure coherence with the fisheries targets laid down in the Decision by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 â€“ 2020, and with the biodiversity targets adopted by the European Council of 25 and 26 March 2010.\n(10)\nSustainable exploitation of marine biological resources should be based on the precautionary approach, which derives from the precautionary principle referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 191(2) of the Treaty, taking into account available scientific data.\n(11)\nThe CFP should contribute to the protection of the marine environment, to the sustainable management of all commercially exploited species, and in particular to the achievement of good environmental status by 2020, as set out in Article 1(1) of Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).\n(12)\nThe CFP should also contribute to the supplying of highly nutritional food to the Union market and to reducing the Union market's dependence on food imports. It should also foster direct and indirect job creation and economic development in coastal areas.\n(13)\nAn ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management needs to be implemented, environmental impacts of fishing activities should be limited and unwanted catches should be avoided and reduced as far as possible.\n(14)\nIt is important for the management of the CFP to be guided by principles of good governance. Those principles include decision-making based on best available scientific advice, broad stakeholder involvement and a long-term perspective. The successful management of the CFP also depends on a clear definition of responsibilities at Union, regional, national and local levels and on the mutual compatibility of the measures taken and their consistency with other Union policies.\n(15)\nThe CFP should contribute to the improvement of safety and working conditions for fishing operators.\n(16)\nThe CFP should pay full regard, where relevant, to animal health, animal welfare, food and feed safety.\n(17)\nSince all matters related to Europe's oceans and seas are interlinked, the CFP should be implemented in a way that is consistent with other Union policies and, in particular, that takes into account interactions with Union actions in other maritime policy areas. Coherence should be ensured in the management of different sectoral policies within the Baltic Sea, North Sea, Celtic seas, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Mediterranean and Black Sea sea basins.\n(18)\nUnion fishing vessels should have equal access to Union waters and resources subject to the rules of the CFP.\n(19)\nExisting rules restricting access to resources within the 12 nautical mile zones of Member States have operated satisfactorily, benefiting conservation by restricting fishing effort in the most sensitive part of Union waters. Those rules have also preserved the traditional fishing activities on which the social and economic development of certain coastal communities is highly dependent. Those rules should therefore continue to apply. Member States should endeavour to give preferential access for small-scale, artisanal or coastal fishermen.\n(20)\nSmall offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper.\n(21)\nMarine biological resources around the Union outermost regions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 349 of the Treaty should be especially protected since they contribute to the preservation of the local economy of those territories, having regard to their structural, social and economic situation. Certain fishing activities in those waters should therefore be limited to fishing vessels registered in the ports of those territories.\n(22)\nIn order to contribute to the conservation of living aquatic resources and marine ecosystems, the Union should endeavour to protect areas that are biologically sensitive, by designating them as protected areas. In such areas, it should be possible to restrict or to prohibit fishing activities. When deciding which areas to designate, particular attention should be paid to those in which there is clear evidence of heavy concentrations of fish below minimum conservation reference size and of spawning grounds, and to areas which are deemed to be bio-geographically sensitive. Account should also be taken of existing conservation areas. In order to facilitate the designation process, Member States should identify suitable areas, including areas that form part of a coherent network, and, where appropriate, should cooperate with one another, preparing and sending joint recommendations to the Commission. In order to establish protected areas more effectively, it should be possible for the Commission to be empowered to establish them in a multiannual plan. In order to ensure a suitable level of democratic accountability and control, the Commission should regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the functioning of those protected areas.\n(23)\nThe objective of sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources is more effectively achieved through a multiannual approach to fisheries management, establishing as a priority multiannual plans reflecting the specificities of different fisheries.\n(24)\nMultiannual plans should, where possible, cover multiple stocks where those stocks are jointly exploited. The multiannual plans should establish the framework for the sustainable exploitation of stocks and marine ecosystems concerned, defining clear time-frames and safeguard mechanisms for unforeseen developments. Multiannual plans should also be governed by clearly defined management objectives in order to contribute to the sustainable exploitation of the stocks and to the protection of the marine ecosystems concerned. Those plans should be adopted in consultation with Advisory Councils, operators in the fishing industry, scientists and other stakeholders having an interest in fisheries management.\n(25)\nDirective 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), Council Directive 92/43/EEC (13) and Directive 2008/56/EC impose certain obligations on Member States as regards special protection areas, special areas of conservation and marine protected areas, respectively. Such measures might require the adoption of measures falling under the CFP. It is, therefore, appropriate to authorise Member States to adopt, in the waters under their sovereignty or jurisdiction, such conservation measures that are necessary to comply with their obligations under those Union acts where such measures do not affect the fisheries interests of other Member States. Where such measures might affect fisheries interests of other Member States, the power to adopt such measures should be granted to the Commission and recourse should be had to regional cooperation among the Member States concerned.\n(26)\nMeasures are needed to reduce the current high levels of unwanted catches and to gradually eliminate discards. Unwanted catches and discards constitute a substantial waste and negatively affect the sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and marine ecosystems and the financial viability of fisheries. An obligation to land all catches (\"the landing obligation\") of species which are subject to catch limits and, in the Mediterranean Sea, also catches of species which are subject to minimum sizes, made during fishing activities in Union waters or by Union fishing vessels should be established and gradually implemented and rules that have so far obliged fishermen to discard should be repealed.\n(27)\nThe landing obligation should be introduced on a fishery-by-fishery basis. Fishermen should be allowed to continue discarding species which, according to the best available scientific advice, have a high survival rate when released into the sea.\n(28)\nIn order to make the landing obligation workable and to mitigate the effect of varying yearly catch compositions, Member States should be allowed to transfer quotas between years, up to a certain percentage.\n(29)\nIn the management of the landing obligation, it is necessary that Member States do their utmost to reduce unwanted catches. To this end, improvements of selective fishing techniques to avoid and reduce, as far as possible, unwanted catches must have high priority. It is important for Member States to distribute quotas between vessels in a mix that reflects as far as possible the expected composition of species in the fisheries. In the event of a mismatch between available quotas and actual fishing pattern, Member States should consider adjustments through quota swaps with other Member States, including on a permanent basis. Member States should also consider facilitating the pooling by vessel owners of individual quotas, for example at the level of producer organisations or groups of vessel owners. Ultimately, Member States should consider counting by-catch species against the quota of the target species, depending on the conservation status of the by-catch species.\n(30)\nThe destination of landings of catches of fish under the minimum conservation reference size should be limited and should exclude sale for human consumption.\n(31)\nIn order to cater for unwanted catches that are unavoidable even when all the measures for their reduction are applied, certain de minimis exemptions from the landing obligation should be established for the fisheries to which the landing obligation applies, primarily through multiannual plans.\n(32)\nSubject to scientific advice and without jeopardising the objectives of maximum sustainable yield or increasing fishing mortality, where the landing obligation, including the obligation to document catches, applies, an increase of related fishing opportunities should be possible, in order to take into account the fact that fish previously discarded will be landed.\n(33)\nAccess to a fishery should be based on transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, social and economic nature. Member States should promote responsible fishing by providing incentives to those operators who fish in the least environmentally damaging way and who provide the greatest benefits for society.\n(34)\nFor stocks for which no multiannual plan has been established, exploitation rates delivering maximum sustainable yield should be ensured by setting catch or fishing effort limits. If available data is insufficient, fisheries should be managed by using approximative parameters.\n(35)\nIn view of the precarious economic state of the fishing industry and the dependence of certain coastal communities on fishing, it is necessary to ensure the relative stability of fishing activities by allocating fishing opportunities among Member States, based on a predictable share of the stocks for each Member State.\n(36)\nSuch relative stability of fishing activities, given the temporary biological situation of stocks, should safeguard and take full account of the particular needs of regions where local communities are especially dependent on fisheries and related activities, as decided by the Council in its Resolution of 3 November 1976 (14), and in particular Annex VII thereto.\n(37)\nTherefore, it is in this sense that the concept of relative stability should be understood.\n(38)\nThe Commission should be authorised to adopt temporary measures in the event of a serious threat, requiring immediate action, to the conservation of marine biological resources or to the marine ecosystem resulting from fishing activities. Those measures should be established within defined time-frames and should be operational for a fixed period of time.\n(39)\nMember States should cooperate at regional level in order to adopt joint recommendations and other instruments for the development and implementation of conservation measures and measures affecting fishing activity in areas protected by environmental law. In the framework of regional cooperation, the Commission should only adopt conservation measures through implementing acts or delegated acts where all Member States concerned in a region agree on a joint recommendation. In the absence of a joint recommendation, the Commission should submit a proposal for the relevant measures pursuant to the Treaty.\n(40)\nMember States should be empowered to adopt conservation and management measures for stocks in Union waters applicable solely to Union fishing vessels flying their flag.\n(41)\nIn their 12 nautical mile zones, Member States should be empowered to adopt conservation and management measures applicable to all Union fishing vessels, provided that, where such measures apply to Union fishing vessels from other Member States, they are non-discriminatory, prior consultation of other Member States concerned has taken place and the Union has not adopted measures specifically addressing conservation and management within the 12 nautical mile zone concerned.\n(42)\nMember States should be able to introduce a system of transferable fishing concessions.\n(43)\nMember States should take specific measures to align the number of Union fishing vessels with available resources, based on their assessments of the balance between the fishing capacity of their fleets and the fishing opportunities available to them. The assessments should be made in accordance with Commission guidelines and be presented in an annual report to be transmitted to the Commission. Those reports should be made public. Each Member State should be able to choose the measures and instruments which it wishes to adopt in order to reduce excessive fishing capacity.\n(44)\nIn addition, compulsory maximum fleet capacity ceilings and national entry/exit schemes in relation to decommissioning funding should be maintained for the purpose of managing and adjusting fishing capacity.\n(45)\nMember States should record the minimum information on characteristics and activities of Union fishing vessels flying their flag. Those records should be made available to the Commission for the purpose of monitoring the size of Member States' fleets.\n(46)\nFisheries management based on the best available scientific advice requires harmonised, reliable and accurate data sets. Therefore, Member States should collect data on fleets and their fishing activities, in particular biological data on catches, including discards and survey information on fish stocks and on the potential environmental impact of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem. Member States should manage and make the collected data available to end-users and to other interested parties. Member States should cooperate with each other and with the Commission to coordinate data collection activities. Where relevant, Member States should also cooperate with third countries regarding data collection. Member States should provide the Commission, for its assessment, with an annual report on their data collection activities, which shall be made public.\n(47)\nData collection should include data which facilitate the economic assessment of undertakings active in the fisheries sector, in aquaculture and in the processing of fisheries and aquaculture products and of employment trends in those industries.\n(48)\nThe Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), as established by Commission Decision 2005/629/EC (15), may be consulted on matters pertaining to the conservation and management of marine biological resources in order to ensure the required assistance of highly qualified scientific personnel, particularly in the application of biological, economic, environmental, social and technical disciplines.\n(49)\nPolicy-oriented fisheries science should be reinforced by means of nationally-adopted fisheries scientific data collection, research and innovation programmes implemented in coordination with other Member States and within Union research and innovation frameworks. Better cooperation between industry and scientists should also be fostered.\n(50)\nThe Union should promote the objectives of the CFP internationally, ensuring that Union fishing activities outside Union waters are based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under Union law, and promoting a levelâ€“playing field for Union operators and third-country operators. To this end, the Union should seek to lead the process of strengthening the performance of regional and international organisations in order to better enable them to conserve and manage marine living resources under their purview, including combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The Union should cooperate with third countries and international organisations for the purpose of improving compliance with international measures, including combating IUU. The position of the Union should be based on the best available scientific advice.\n(51)\nSustainable fisheries partnership agreements with third countries should ensure that Union fishing activities in third country waters are based on the best available scientific advice and relevant information exchange, ensuring a sustainable exploitation of the marine biological resources, transparency as regards the determination of the surplus and, consequently, a management of the resources that is consistent with the objectives of the CFP. Those agreements, which provide for access to resources commensurate with the interests of the Union fleet in exchange for a financial contribution from the Union, should contribute to the establishment of a high quality governance framework to ensure, in particular, efficient data collection, monitoring, control and surveillance measures.\n(52)\nRespect for democratic principles and human rights, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments, and for the principle of the rule of law, should constitute an essential element of sustainable fisheries partnership agreements, which should contain a specific human rights clause. The introduction of a human rights clause in sustainable fisheries partnership agreements should be fully consistent with the overall Union development policy objectives.\n(53)\nAquaculture should contribute to the preservation of the food production potential on a sustainable basis throughout the Union so as to guarantee long-term food security, including food supplies, as well as growth and employment for Union citizens, and to contribute to meeting the growing world demand for aquatic food.\n(54)\nThe Commission's Strategy for the Sustainable Development of European Aquaculture adopted in 2009, which was welcomed and endorsed by the Council and welcomed by the European Parliament, noted the need for the creation and promotion of a level-playing field for aquaculture as the basis for its sustainable development.\n(55)\nAquaculture activities in the Union are influenced by different conditions across national borders, including as regards authorisations for the operators. Therefore, Union strategic guidelines for national strategic plans should be developed to improve the competitiveness of the aquaculture industry, supporting its development and innovation, and encouraging economic activity, diversification and improving the quality of life in coastal and inland areas. Furthermore, mechanisms should be introduced for the exchange between Member States of information and best practices through an open method of coordination of national measures concerning business security, access to Union waters and space, and the simplification of licensing procedures.\n(56)\nThe specific nature of aquaculture requires an Advisory Council for stakeholder consultation on elements of Union policies which could affect aquaculture.\n(57)\nThere is a need to strengthen the competitiveness of the Union fishery and aquaculture sector, and for simplification in support of better management of its production and marketing activities. The common market organisation for fishery and aquaculture products should ensure a level-playing field for all fishery and aquaculture products marketed in the Union regardless of their origin, should enable consumers to make better informed choices and support responsible consumption, and should improve the economic knowledge and understanding of the Union markets along the supply chain.\n(58)\nThe common market organisation should be implemented in compliance with international commitments of the Union, in particular with regard to the provisions of the World Trade Organisation.\n(59)\nIn order to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP, an effective system of control, inspection and enforcement should be established, that includes the fight against IUU fishing activities.\n(60)\nThe use of modern and effective technologies should be promoted in the framework of the Union system for control, inspection, and enforcement. Member States and the Commission should have the possibility to conduct pilot projects on new control technologies and data management systems.\n(61)\nIn order to ensure that the conditions in different Member States for the application of control and enforcement rules are comparable, cooperation between Member States on identifying effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties should be encouraged.\n(62)\nIn order to ensure the involvement of operators in the Union data collection and in the Union system for control, inspection, and enforcement, Member States should be able to require their operators to contribute proportionally to the corresponding operational costs.\n(63)\nThe objectives of the CFP cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone, given the problems encountered in the development of the fishing industry and its management, and the limits on the financial resources of the Member States. Therefore, to contribute to the achievement of those objectives, multiannual Union financial assistance should be granted that is focused on the priorities of the CFP and tailored to the specific features of the fishing industry in individual Member States.\n(64)\nUnion financial assistance should be made conditional upon compliance by Member States and operators, including vessel owners, with the rules of the CFP. Subject to specific rules to be adopted, Union financial assistance should be interrupted, suspended or corrected in cases of non-compliance with a specific obligation of the CFP by a Member State or a serious infringement of those rules by an operator.\n(65)\nDialogue with stakeholders has proven to be essential for achieving the objectives of the CFP. Taking into account the diverse conditions throughout Union waters and the increased regionalisation of the CFP, Advisory Councils should enable the CFP to benefit from the knowledge and experience of all stakeholders.\n(66)\nIn view of the special characteristics of the outermost regions, of aquaculture, of markets and of the Black Sea, it is appropriate to establish a new Advisory Council for each of them.\n(67)\nThe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of conservation measures accompanying certain environmental obligations by Member States, the adapting of the landing obligation for the purpose of complying with the Union's international obligations, the extension of the landing obligation to other species using the regionalisation process, the adoption of specific discard plans using the regionalisation process, the adoption of de minimis exemptions to the landing obligation if no other implementation measure for that obligation has been adopted, and the establishment of detailed rules for the functioning of Advisory Councils. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(68)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions of this Regulation in respect of temporary measures to alleviate a serious threat to the conservation of marine biological resources, of the entry-exit scheme in fleet management and of the recording, format and transmission of data for the Union fishing fleet register, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16).\n(69)\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.\n(70)\nCouncil Decision 2004/585/EC (17) should be repealed upon entry in force of the corresponding rules pursuant to this Regulation.\n(71)\nBy reason of the number and importance of the amendments to be made, Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nPART I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.   The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) shall cover:\n(a)\nthe conservation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources;\n(b)\nin relation to measures on markets and financial measures in support of the implementation of the CFP: fresh water biological resources, aquaculture, and the processing and marketing of fisheries and aquaculture products.\n2.   The CFP shall cover the activities referred to in paragraph 1 where they are carried out:\n(a)\non the territory of Member States to which the Treaty applies;\n(b)\nin Union waters, including by fishing vessels flying the flag of, and registered in, third countries;\n(c)\nby Union fishing vessels outside Union waters; or\n(d)\nby nationals of Member States, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag State.\nArticle 2\nObjectives\n1.   The CFP shall ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long-term and are managed in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food supplies.\n2.   The CFP shall apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and shall aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield.\nIn order to reach the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.\n3.   The CFP shall implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management so as to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised, and shall endeavour to ensure that aquaculture and fisheries activities avoid the degradation of the marine environment.\n4.   The CFP shall contribute to the collection of scientific data.\n5.   The CFP shall, in particular:\n(a)\ngradually eliminate discards, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the best available scientific advice, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and by gradually ensuring that catches are landed;\n(b)\nwhere necessary, make the best use of unwanted catches, without creating a market for such of those catches that are below the minimum conservation reference size;\n(c)\nprovide conditions for economically viable and competitive fishing capture and processing industry and land-based fishing related activity;\n(d)\nprovide for measures to adjust the fishing capacity of the fleets to levels of fishing opportunities consistent with paragraph 2, with a view to having economically viable fleets without overexploiting marine biological resources;\n(e)\npromote the development of sustainable Union aquaculture activities to contribute to food supplies and security and employment;\n(f)\ncontribute to a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities, bearing in mind coastal fisheries and socio-economic aspects;\n(g)\ncontribute to an efficient and transparent internal market for fisheries and aquaculture products and contribute to ensuring a levelâ€“playing field for fisheries and aquaculture products marketed in the Union;\n(h)\ntake into account the interests of both consumers and producers;\n(i)\npromote coastal fishing activities, taking into account socio-economic aspects;\n(j)\nbe coherent with the Union environmental legislation, in particular with the objective of achieving a good environmental status by 2020 as set out in Article 1(1) of Directive 2008/56/EC, as well as with other Union policies.\nArticle 3\nPrinciples of good governance\nThe CFP shall be guided by the following principles of good governance:\n(a)\nthe clear definition of responsibilities at the Union, regional, national and local levels;\n(b)\nthe taking into account of regional specificities, through a regionalised approach;\n(c)\nthe establishment of measures in accordance with the best available scientific advice;\n(d)\na long-term perspective;\n(e)\nadministrative cost efficiency;\n(f)\nappropriate involvement of stakeholders, in particular Advisory Councils, at all stages - from conception to implementation of the measures;\n(g)\nthe primary responsibility of the flag State;\n(h)\nconsistency with other Union policies;\n(i)\nthe use of impact assessments as appropriate;\n(j)\ncoherence between the internal and external dimension of the CFP;\n(k)\ntransparency of data handling in accordance with existing legal requirements, with due respect for private life, the protection of personal data and confidentiality rules; availability of data to the appropriate scientific bodies, other bodies with a scientific or management interest, and other defined end-users.\nArticle 4\nDefinitions\n1.

For the purpose of achieving the objectives of the CFP in respect of the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources as set out in Article 2, the Union shall adopt conservation measures as set out in Article 7.\n2.   When applying this Regulation, the Commission shall consult the relevant advisory bodies and the relevant scientific bodies. Conservation measures shall be adopted taking into account available scientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by STECF and other advisory bodies, advice received from Advisory Councils and joint recommendations made by Member States pursuant to Article 18.\n3.   Member States may cooperate with one another for the purpose of adopting measures pursuant to Articles 11, 15 and 18.\n4.   Member States shall coordinate with one another before adopting national measures pursuant to Article 20(2).\n5.   In specific cases, in particular as regards the Mediterranean region, Member States may be empowered to adopt legally binding acts in the area of the CFP, including conservation measures. Article 18 shall apply, where appropriate.\nArticle 7\nTypes of conservation measures\n1.   Measures for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources may include, inter alia, the following:\n(a)\nmultiannual plans under Articles 9 and 10;\n(b)\ntargets for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of stocks and related measures to minimise the impact of fishing on the marine environment;\n(c)\nmeasures to adapt the fishing capacity of fishing vessels to available fishing opportunities;\n(d)\nincentives, including those of an economic nature, such as fishing opportunities, to promote fishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing, to the avoidance and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, and to fishing with low impact on the marine ecosystem and fishery resources;\n(e)\nmeasures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities;\n(f)\nmeasures to achieve the objectives of Article 15;\n(g)\nminimum conservation reference sizes;\n(h)\npilot projects on alternative types of fishing management techniques and on gears that increase selectivity or that minimise the negative impact of fishing activities on the marine environment;\n(i)\nmeasures necessary for compliance with obligations under Union environmental legislation adopted pursuant to Article 11;\n(j)\ntechnical measures as referred to in paragraph 2.\n2.   Technical measures may include, inter alia, the following:\n(a)\ncharacteristics of fishing gears and rules concerning their use;\n(b)\nspecifications on the construction of fishing gear, including:\n(i)\nmodifications or additional devices to improve selectivity or to minimise the negative impact on the ecosystem;\n(ii)\nmodifications or additional devices to reduce the incidental capture of endangered, threatened and protected species, as well as to reduce other unwanted catches;\n(c)\nlimitations or prohibitions on the use of certain fishing gears, and on fishing activities, in certain areas or periods;\n(d)\nrequirements for fishing vessels to cease operating in a defined area for a defined minimum period in order to protect temporary aggregations of endangered species, spawning fish, fish below minimum conservation reference size, and other vulnerable marine resources;\n(e)\nspecific measures to minimise the negative impact of fishing activities on marine biodiversity and marine ecosystems, including measures to avoid and reduce, as far as possible, unwanted catches.\nArticle 8\nEstablishment of fish stock recovery areas\n1.   The Union shall, while taking due account of existing conservation areas, endeavour to establish protected areas due to their biological sensitivity, including areas where there is clear evidence of heavy concentrations of fish below minimum conservation reference size and of spawning grounds. In such areas fishing activities may be restricted or prohibited in order to contribute to the conservation of living aquatic resources and marine ecosystems. The Union shall continue to give additional protection to existing biologically sensitive areas.\n2.   For those purposes, Member States shall identify, where possible, suitable areas which may form part of a coherent network and shall prepare, where appropriate, joint recommendations in accordance with Article 18(7) with a view to the Commission submitting a proposal in accordance with the Treaty.\n3.   The Commission may be empowered in a multiannual plan to establish such biologically sensitive protected areas. Article 18(1) to (6) shall apply. The Commission shall report regularly to the European Parliament and to the Council on protected areas.\nTITLE II\nSpecific measures\nArticle 9\nPrinciples and objectives of multiannual plans\n1.   Multiannual plans shall be adopted as a priority, based on scientific, technical and economic advice, and shall contain conservation measures to restore and maintain fish stocks above levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield in accordance with Article 2(2).\n2.   Where targets relating to the maximum sustainable yield as referred to in Article 2(2) cannot be determined, owing to insufficient data, the multiannual plans shall provide for measures based on the precautionary approach, ensuring at least a comparable degree of conservation of the relevant stocks.\n3.   Multiannual plans shall cover either:\n(a)\nsingle species; or\n(b)\nin the case of mixed fisheries or where the dynamics of stocks relate to one another, fisheries exploiting several stocks in a relevant geographical area, taking into account knowledge about the interactions between fish stocks, fisheries and marine ecosystems.\n4.   The measures to be included in multiannual plans, and the calendar for implementing them, shall be proportionate to the objectives and targets pursued and to the time-frame envisaged. Before measures are included in the multiannual plans, account shall be taken of their likely economic and social impact.\n5.   Multiannual plans may contain specific conservation objectives and measures based on the ecosystem approach in order to address the specific problems of mixed fisheries in relation to the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 2(2) for the mixture of stocks covered by the plan in cases where scientific advice indicates that increases in selectivity cannot be achieved. Where necessary, the multiannual plan shall include specific alternative conservation measures, based on the ecosystem approach, for some of the stocks that it covers.\nArticle 10\nContent of multiannual plans\n1.   As appropriate and without prejudice to the respective competences under the Treaty, a multiannual plan shall include:\n(a)\nthe scope, in terms of stocks, fishery and the area to which the multiannual plan shall be applied;\n(b)\nobjectives that are consistent with the objectives set out in Article 2 and with the relevant provisions of Articles 6 and 9;\n(c)\nquantifiable targets such as fishing mortality rates and/or spawning stock biomass;\n(d)\nclear time-frames to reach the quantifiable targets;\n(e)\nconservation reference points consistent with the objectives set out in Article 2;\n(f)\nobjectives for conservation and technical measures to be taken in order to achieve the targets set out in Article 15, and measures designed to avoid and reduce, as far as possible, unwanted catches;\n(g)\nsafeguards to ensure that quantifiable targets are met, as well as remedial action, where needed, including for situations where the deteriorating quality of data or non-availability put the sustainability of the stock at risk.\n2.   A multiannual plan may also include:\n(a)\nother conservation measures, in particular measures to gradually eliminate discards, taking into account the best available scientific advice, or to minimise the negative impact of fishing on the ecosystem, to be further specified, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 18;\n(b)\nquantifiable indicators for periodic monitoring and assessment of progress in achieving the targets of the multiannual plan;\n(c)\nwhere appropriate, specific objectives for the freshwater part of the life cycle of anadromous and catadromous species.\n3.   A multiannual plan shall provide for its revision after an initial ex-post evaluation, in particular to take account of changes in scientific advice.\nArticle 11\nConservation measures necessary for compliance with obligations under Union environmental legislation\n1.   Member States are empowered to adopt conservation measures not affecting fishing vessels of other Member States that are applicable to waters under their sovereignty or jurisdiction and that are necessary for the purpose of complying with their obligations under Article 13(4) of Directive 2008/56/EC, Article 4 of Directive 2009/147/EC or Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC, provided that those measures are compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2 of this Regulation, meet the objectives of the relevant Union legislation that they intend to implement, and are at least as stringent as measures under Union law.\n2.   Where a Member State (\"the initiating Member State\") considers that measures need to be adopted for the purpose of complying with the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 and other Member States have a direct management interest in the fishery to be affected by such measures, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt such measures, upon request, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 46. For this purpose, Article 18(1) to (4) and (6) shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n3.   The initiating Member State shall provide the Commission and the other Member States having a direct management interest with relevant information on the measures required, including their rationale, scientific evidence in support and details on their practical implementation and enforcement. The initiating Member State and the other Member States having a direct management interest may submit a joint recommendation, as referred to in Article 18(1), within six months from the provision of sufficient information. The Commission shall adopt the measures, taking into account any available scientific advice, within three months from receipt of a complete request.\nIf not all Member States succeed in agreeing on a joint recommendation to be submitted to the Commission in accordance with the first subparagraph within the deadline set therein, or if the joint recommendation is deemed not to be compatible with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may submit a proposal in accordance with the Treaty.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, in the absence of a joint recommendation referred to in paragraph 3, in cases of urgency, the Commission shall adopt the measures. The measures to be adopted in a case of urgency shall be limited to those in the absence of which the achievement of the objectives associated with the establishment of the conservation measures in accordance with the Directives referred to in paragraph 1 and the Member State's intentions, is in jeopardy.\n5.   The measures referred to in paragraph 4 shall apply for a maximum period of 12 months which may be extended for a maximum period of 12 months where the conditions provided for in that paragraph continue to exist.\n6.   The Commission shall facilitate cooperation between the Member State concerned and the other Member States having a direct management interest in the fishery in the process of implementation and enforcement of the measures adopted under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.\nArticle 12\nCommission measures in case of a serious threat to marine biological resources\n1.   On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to a serious threat to the conservation of marine biological resources or to the marine ecosystem based on evidence, the Commission, at the reasoned request of a Member State or on its own initiative, may, in order to alleviate that threat, adopt immediately applicable implementing acts applicable for a maximum period of six months in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 47(3).\n2.   The Member State shall communicate the request referred to in paragraph 1 simultaneously to the Commission, to other Member States and to the Advisory Councils concerned. The other Member States and the Advisory Councils may submit their written comments within seven working days of the receipt of the notification. The Commission shall take a decision within 15 working days of the receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   Before expiry of the initial period of application of immediately applicable implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may, where the conditions under paragraph 1 are complied with, adopt immediately applicable implementing acts extending the application of such emergency measure for a maximum period of six months with immediate effect. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 47(3).\nArticle 13\nMember State emergency measures\n1.   On the basis of evidence of a serious threat to the conservation of marine biological resources or to the marine ecosystem relating to fishing activities in waters falling under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a Member State that require immediate action, that Member State may adopt emergency measures to alleviate the threat. Such measures shall be compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2 and no less stringent than those provided for in Union law. Such measures shall apply for a maximum period of three months.\n2.   Where emergency measures to be adopted by a Member State are liable to affect fishing vessels of other Member States, such measures shall be adopted only after consulting the Commission, the relevant Member States and the relevant Advisory Councils on a draft of the measures accompanied by an explanatory memorandum. The consulting Member State may set a reasonable deadline for the consultation which shall, however, not be shorter than one month.\n3.   Where the Commission considers that a measure adopted under this Article does not comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1, it may, subject to providing relevant reasons, request that the Member State concerned amend or repeal that measure.\nArticle 14\nAvoidance and minimisation of unwanted catches\n1.   In order to facilitate the introduction of the obligation to land all catches in the respective fishery in accordance with Article 15 (\"the landing obligation\"), Member States may conduct pilot projects, based on the best available scientific advice and taking into account the opinions of the relevant Advisory Councils, with the aim of fully exploring all practicable methods for the avoidance, minimisation and elimination of unwanted catches in a fishery.\n2.   Member States may produce a \"discard atlas\" showing the level of discards in each of the fisheries which are covered by Article 15(1).\nArticle 15\nLanding obligation\n1.   All catches of species which are subject to catch limits and, in the Mediterranean, also catches of species which are subject to minimum sizes as defined in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006, caught during fishing activities in Union waters or by Union fishing vessels outside Union waters in waters not subject to third countries' sovereignty or jurisdiction, in the fisheries and geographical areas listed below shall be brought and retained on board the fishing vessels, recorded, landed and counted against the quotas where applicable, except when used as live bait, in accordance with the following time-frames:\n(a)\nFrom 1 January 2015 at the latest:\nâ€”\nsmall pelagic fisheries (i.e. fisheries for mackerel, herring, horse mackerel, blue whiting, boarfish, anchovy, argentine, sardine, sprat);\nâ€”\nlarge pelagic fisheries (i.e. fisheries for bluefin tuna, swordfish, albacore tuna, bigeye tuna, blue and white marlin);\nâ€”\nfisheries for industrial purposes (inter alia, fisheries for capelin, sandeel and Norwegian pout);\nâ€”\nfisheries for salmon in the Baltic Sea.\n(b)\nFrom 1 January 2015 at the latest for species which define the fisheries and from 1 January 2017 at the latest for all other species in fisheries in Union waters of the Baltic Sea for species subject to catch limits other than those covered by point (a).\n(c)\nFrom 1 January 2016 at the latest for the species which define the fisheries and from 1 January 2019 at the latest for all other species in:\n(i)\nthe North Sea\nâ€”\nfisheries for cod, haddock, whiting, saithe;\nâ€”\nfisheries for Norway lobster;\nâ€”\nfisheries for common sole and plaice;\nâ€”\nfisheries for hake;\nâ€”\nfisheries for Northern prawn;\n(ii)\nNorth Western waters\nâ€”\nfisheries for cod, haddock, whiting, saithe;\nâ€”\nfisheries for Norway lobster;\nâ€”\nfisheries for common sole and plaice;\nâ€”\nfisheries for hake;\n(iii)\nSouth Western waters\nâ€”\nfisheries for Norway lobster;\nâ€”\nfisheries for common sole and plaice;\nâ€”\nfisheries for hake;\n(iv)\nother fisheries for species subject to catch limits.\n(d)\nFrom 1 January 2017 at the latest for species which define the fisheries and from 1 January 2019 at the latest for all other species in fisheries not covered by point (a) in the Mediterranean, in the Black Sea and in all other Union waters and in non-Union waters not subject to third countries' sovereignty or jurisdiction.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the Union's international obligations. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 46, for the purpose of implementing such international obligations into Union law, including, in particular, derogations from the landing obligation under this Article.\n3.   Where all the Member States having a direct management interest in a particular fishery agree that the landing obligation should apply to species other than those listed in paragraph 1, they may submit a joint recommendation for the purpose of extending the application of the landing obligation to such other species. For this purpose, Article 18(1) to (6) shall apply mutatis mutandis. Where such a joint recommendation is submitted, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 46, containing such measures.\n4.   The landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to:\n(a)\nspecies in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the CFP;\n(b)\nspecies for which scientific evidence demonstrates high survival rates, taking into account the characteristics of the gear, of the fishing practices and of the ecosystem;\n(c)\ncatches falling under de minimis exemptions.\n5.   Details of the implementation of the landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be specified in multiannual plans referred to in Articles 9 and 10 and, where relevant, further specified in accordance with Article 18, including:\n(a)\nspecific provisions regarding fisheries or species covered by the landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nthe specification of exemptions to the landing obligation of species referred to in point (b) of paragraph 4;\n(c)\nprovisions for de minimis exemptions of up to 5 % of total annual catches of all species subject to the landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1. The de minimis exemption shall apply in the following cases:\n(i)\nwhere scientific evidence indicates that increases in selectivity are very difficult to achieve; or\n(ii)\nto avoid disproportionate costs of handling unwanted catches, for those fishing gears where unwanted catches per fishing gear do not represent more than a certain percentage, to be established in a plan, of total annual catch of that gear.\nCatches under the provisions referred to in this point shall not be counted against the relevant quotas; however, all such catches shall be fully recorded.\nFor a transitional period of four years, the percentage of the total annual catches referred to in this point shall increase:\n(i)\nby two percentage points in the first two years of application of the landing obligation; and\n(ii)\nby one percentage point in the subsequent two years;\n(d)\nprovisions on documentation of catches;\n(e)\nwhere appropriate, the fixing of minimum conservation reference sizes in accordance with paragraph 10.\n6.   Where no multiannual plan, or no management plan in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006, is adopted for the fishery in question, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt, in accordance with Article 18 of this Regulation, delegated acts in accordance with Article 46 of this Regulation, laying down on a temporary basis and for a period of no more than three years a specific discard plan containing the specifications referred to in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 5 of this Article. Member States may cooperate, in accordance with Article 18 of this Regulation, in the drawing up of such a plan with a view to the Commission adopting such acts or submitting a proposal in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.\n7.   Where no measures have been adopted for the purpose of specifying the de minimis exemption either in a multiannual plan in accordance with paragraph 5 or in a specific discard plan in accordance with paragraph 6, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 46, setting the de minimis exemption referred to in point (c) of paragraph 4 which shall, subject to the conditions set out in point (c)(i) or (ii) of paragraph 5, amount to no more than 5 % of total annual catches of all species to which the landing obligation applies under paragraph 1. That de minimis exemption shall be adopted so as to apply from the date of application of the relevant landing obligation.\n8.   By way of derogation from the obligation to count catches against the relevant quotas in accordance with paragraph 1, catches of species that are subject to the landing obligation and that are caught in excess of quotas of the stocks in question, or catches of species in respect of which the Member State has no quota, may be deducted from the quota of the target species provided that they do not exceed 9 % of the quota of the target species. This provision shall only apply where the stock of the non-target species is within safe biological limits.\n9.   For stocks subject to the landing obligation, Member States may use a year-to-year flexibility of up to 10 % of their permitted landings. For this purpose, a Member State may allow landing of additional quantities of the stock that is subject to the landing obligation provided that such quantities do not exceed 10 % of the quota allocated to that Member State. Article 105 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 shall apply.\n10.   Minimum conservation reference sizes may be established with the aim of ensuring the protection of juveniles of marine organisms.\n11.   For the species subject to the landing obligation as specified in paragraph 1, the use of catches of species below the minimum conservation reference size shall be restricted to purposes other than direct human consumption, including fish meal, fish oil, pet food, food additives, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.\n12.   For species that are not subject to the landing obligation as specified in paragraph 1, the catches of species below the minimum conservation reference size shall not be retained on board, but shall be returned immediately to the sea.\n13.   For the purpose of monitoring compliance with the landing obligation, Member States shall ensure detailed and accurate documentation of all fishing trips and adequate capacity and means, such as observers, closed-circuit television (CCTV) and others. In doing so, Member States shall respect the principle of efficiency and proportionality.\nArticle 16\nFishing opportunities\n1.   Fishing opportunities allocated to Member States shall ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery. The interests of each Member State shall be taken into account when new fishing opportunities are allocated.\n2.   When the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities shall be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches, on the basis of the fact that, for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed.\n3.   Where new scientific evidence shows that there is a significant disparity between the fishing opportunities that have been fixed for a specific stock and the actual state of that stock, Member States having a direct management interest may submit a reasoned request to the Commission for it to submit a proposal to alleviate that disparity, while respecting the objectives set out in Article 2(2).\n4.   Fishing opportunities shall be fixed in accordance with the objectives set out in Article 2(2) and shall comply with quantifiable targets, time-frames and margins established in accordance with Article 9(2) and points (b) and (c) of Article 10(1).\n5.   Measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities available to third countries in Union waters shall be established in accordance with the Treaty.\n6.   Each Member State shall decide how the fishing opportunities that are allocated to it, and which are not subject to a system of transferable fishing concessions, may be allocated to vessels flying its flag (e.g. by creating individual fishing opportunities). It shall inform the Commission of the allocation method.\n7.   For the allocation of fishing opportunities pertaining to mixed fisheries, Member States shall take account of the likely catch composition of vessels participating in such fisheries.\n8.   Member States may, after notifying the Commission, exchange all or part of the fishing opportunities allocated to them.\nArticle 17\nCriteria for the allocation of fishing opportunities by Member States\nWhen allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, as referred to in Article 16, Member States shall use transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, social and economic nature. The criteria to be used may include, inter alia, the impact of fishing on the environment, the history of compliance, the contribution to the local economy and historic catch levels. Within the fishing opportunities allocated to them, Member States shall endeavour to provide incentives to fishing vessels deploying selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact, such as reduced energy consumption or habitat damage.\nTITLE III\nRegionalisation\nArticle 18\nRegional cooperation on conservation measures\n1.   Where the Commission has been granted powers, including in a multiannual plan established pursuant to Articles 9 and 10, as well as in cases provided for in Articles 11 and 15(6), to adopt measures by means of delegated or implementing acts in respect of a Union conservation measure applying to a relevant geographical area, Member States having a direct management interest affected by those measures may, within a deadline to be stipulated in the relevant conservation measure and/or multiannual plan, agree to submit joint recommendations for achieving the objectives of the relevant Union conservation measures, the multiannual plans or the specific discard plans. The Commission shall not adopt any such delegated or implementing acts before the expiry of the deadline for submission of joint recommendations by the Member States.\n2.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, Member States having a direct management interest affected by the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall cooperate with one another in formulating joint recommendations. They shall also consult the relevant Advisory Councils. The Commission shall facilitate the cooperation between Member States, including, where necessary, by ensuring that a scientific contribution is obtained from the relevant scientific bodies.\n3.   Where a joint recommendation is submitted under paragraph 1, the Commission may adopt those measures by means of delegated or implementing acts, provided that such recommendation is compatible with the relevant conservation measure and/or multiannual plan.\n4.   Where the conservation measure applies to a specific fish stock shared with third countries and managed by multilateral fisheries organisations or under bilateral or multilateral agreements, the Union shall endeavour to agree with the relevant partners the measures that are necessary to achieve the objectives set out in Article 2.\n5.   Member States shall ensure that the joint recommendations on conservation measures to be adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 are based on the best available scientific advice and fulfil all of the following requirements:\n(a)\nthey are compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2;\n(b)\nthey are compatible with the scope and objectives of the relevant conservation measure;\n(c)\nthey are compatible with the scope and meet the objectives and quantifiable targets set out in a relevant multiannual plan effectively;\n(d)\nthey are at least as stringent as measures under Union law.\n6.   If all Member States do not succeed in agreeing on joint recommendations to be submitted to the Commission in accordance with paragraph 1 within a set deadline or if the joint recommendations on conservation measures are deemed not to be compatible with the objectives and quantifiable targets of the conservation measures in question, the Commission may submit a proposal for appropriate measures in accordance with the Treaty.\n7.   In addition to the cases referred to in paragraph 1, Member States having a direct management interest in a fishery in a defined geographical area may also make joint recommendations to the Commission on measures to be proposed or adopted by the Commission.\n8.   As a supplementary or alternative method of regional cooperation, Member States will be empowered, in a Union conservation measure that applies to a relevant geographical area, including in a multiannual plan established pursuant to Articles 9 and 10, to adopt within a set deadline measures further specifying that conservation measure. The Member States concerned shall closely cooperate in the adoption of such measures. Paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of this Article shall apply mutatis mutandis. The Commission shall be associated and its comments shall be taken into account. Member States shall only adopt their respective national measures if an agreement on the content of those measures has been reached by all the Member States concerned. Where the Commission considers that a Member State's measure does not comply with the conditions set out in the relevant conservation measure, it may, subject to providing relevant reasons, request that the Member State concerned amend or repeal that measure.\nTITLE IV\nNational measures\nArticle 19\nMember State measures applicable to fishing vessels flying their flag or to persons established in their territory\n1.   A Member State may adopt measures for the conservation of fish stocks in Union waters provided that those measures fulfil all of the following requirements:\n(a)\nthey apply solely to fishing vessels flying the flag of that Member State or, in the case of fishing activities which are not conducted by a fishing vessel, to persons established in that part of its territory to which the Treaty applies;\n(b)\nthey are compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2;\n(c)\nthey are at least as stringent as measures under Union law.\n2.   A Member State shall, for control purposes, inform the other Member States concerned of provisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 1.\n3.   Member States shall make publicly available appropriate information concerning the measures adopted in accordance with this Article.\nArticle 20\nMember State measures within the 12 nautical mile zone\n1.   A Member State may take non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks and the maintenance or improvement of the conservation status of marine ecosystems within 12 nautical miles of its baselines provided that the Union has not adopted measures addressing conservation and management specifically for that area or specifically addressing the problem identified by the Member State concerned. The Member State measures shall be compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2 and shall be at least as stringent as measures under Union law.\n2.   Where conservation and management measures to be adopted by a Member State are liable to affect fishing vessels of other Member States, such measures shall be adopted only after consulting the Commission, the relevant Member States and the relevant Advisory Councils on a draft of the measures, which shall be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum that demonstrates, inter alia, that those measures are non-discriminatory. For the purpose of such consultation, the consulting Member State may set a reasonable deadline, which shall, however, not be shorter than two months.\n3.   Member States shall make publicly available appropriate information concerning the measures adopted in accordance with this Article.\n4.   Where the Commission considers that a measure adopted under this Article does not comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1, it may, subject to providing relevant reasons, request that the Member State concerned amends or repeals the relevant measure.\nPART IV\nMANAGEMENT OF FISHING CAPACITY\nArticle 21\nEstablishment of systems of transferable fishing concessions\nMember States may establish a system of transferable fishing concessions.

In order to achieve the objective referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall send to the Commission, by 31 May each year, a report on the balance between the fishing capacity of their fleets and their fishing opportunities. To facilitate a common approach across the Union, that report shall be prepared in accordance with common guidelines which may be developed by the Commission indicating the relevant technical, social and economic parameters.\nThe report shall contain the annual capacity assessment of the national fleet and of all fleet segments of the Member State. The report shall seek to identify structural overcapacity by segment and shall estimate the long-term profitability by segment. The reports shall be made publicly available.\n3.   With regard to the assessment referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2, Member States shall base their analysis on the balance between the fishing capacity of their fleets and their fishing opportunities. Separate assessments shall be drawn up for fleets operating in the outermost regions and for vessels operating exclusively outside Union waters.\n4.   If the assessment clearly demonstrates that the fishing capacity is not effectively balanced with fishing opportunities, the Member State shall prepare and include in its report an action plan for the fleet segments with identified structural overcapacity. The action plan shall set out the adjustment targets and tools to achieve a balance and a clear time-frame for its implementation.\nOn a yearly basis, the Commission shall prepare a report for the European Parliament and for the Council on the balance between the fishing capacity of the Member States' fleets and their fishing opportunities, in accordance with the guidelines referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2. The report shall include action plans referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. The first report shall be submitted by 31 March 2015.\nFailure to make the report referred to in paragraph 2, and/or failure to implement the action plan referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, may result in a proportionate suspension or interruption of relevant Union financial assistance to that Member State for fleet investment in the fleet segment or segments concerned in accordance with a future Union legal act establishing the conditions for the financial support for maritime and fisheries policy for the period 2014â€“2020.\n5.   No exit from the fleet supported by public aid shall be permitted unless preceded by the withdrawal of the fishing licence and the fishing authorisations.\n6.   The fishing capacity corresponding to the fishing vessels withdrawn with public aid shall not be replaced.\n7.   Member States shall ensure that from 1 January 2014 the fishing capacity of their fleets does not exceed at any time the fishing capacity ceilings set out in Annex II.\nArticle 23\nEntry/Exit scheme\n1.   Member States shall manage entries into their fleets and exits from their fleets in such a way that the entry into the fleet of new capacity without public aid is compensated for by the prior withdrawal of capacity without public aid of at least the same amount.\n2.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down implementing rules for the application of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 47(2).\n3.   No later than 30 December 2018, the Commission shall evaluate the Entry/Exit scheme in the light of the evolving relationship between fleet capacity and prospected fishing opportunities, and propose, where appropriate, an amendment to that scheme.\nArticle 24\nFishing fleet registers\n1.   Member States shall record the information on ownership, on vessel and gear characteristics and on the activity of Union fishing vessels flying their flag that is necessary for the management of measures established under this Regulation.\n2.   Member States shall submit to the Commission the information referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.

Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements with third countries shall establish a legal, environmental, economic and social governance framework for fishing activities carried out by Union fishing vessels in third country waters.\nSuch frameworks may include:\n(a)\ndevelopment and support for the necessary scientific and research institutions;\n(b)\nmonitoring, control and surveillance capabilities;\n(c)\nother capacity building elements concerning the development of a sustainable fisheries policy of the third country.\n2.   For the purpose of ensuring the sustainable exploitation of surpluses of marine biological resources, the Union shall endeavour to ensure that the Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements with third countries are of mutual benefit to the Union and to the third country concerned, including its local population and fishing industry and that they contribute to continuing the activity of Union fleets and seek to obtain an appropriate share of the available surplus, commensurate with the Union fleets' interest.\n3.   For the purpose of ensuring that Union vessels fishing under Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements operate, where appropriate, under similar standards to those applicable to Union fishing vessels fishing in Union waters, the Union shall endeavour to include in Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements appropriate provisions on obligations to land fish and fishery products.\n4.   Union fishing vessels shall only catch surplus of the allowable catch as referred to in Article 62(2) and (3) of the UNCLOS, and identified, in a clear and transparent manner, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and of the relevant information exchanged between the Union and the third country about the total fishing effort on the affected stocks by all fleets. Concerning straddling or highly migratory fish stocks, the determination of the resources available for access should take due account of scientific assessments conducted at the regional level as well as conservation and management measures adopted by relevant RFMOs.\n5.   Union fishing vessels shall not operate in the waters of the third country with which a Sustainable fisheries partnership agreement is in force unless they are in possession of a fishing authorisation which has been issued in accordance with that agreement.\n6.   The Union shall ensure that Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements include a clause concerning respect for democratic principles and human rights, which constitutes an essential element of such agreements.\nThose agreements shall also, to the extent possible, include:\n(a)\na clause prohibiting the granting of more favourable conditions to other fleets fishing in those waters than those granted to Union economic actors, including conditions concerning the conservation, development and management of resources, financial arrangements, and fees and rights relating to the issuing of fishing authorisations;\n(b)\nan exclusivity clause relating to the rule provided for in paragraph 5.\n7.   Efforts shall be made at Union level to monitor the activities of Union fishing vessels that operate in nonâ€“Union waters outside the framework of Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that Union fishing vessels flying their flag and operating outside Union waters are in a position to provide detailed and accurate documentation of all fishing and processing activities.\n9.   A fishing authorisation, as referred to in paragraph 5, shall be granted to a vessel which has left the Union fishing fleet register and which has subsequently returned to it within 24 months, only if the owner of that vessel has provided to the competent authorities of the flag Member State all data required to establish that, during that period, the vessel was operating in a manner fully consistent with the standards applicable to a vessel flagged in the Union.\nWhere the state granting the flag during the period that the vessel was off the Union fishing fleet register became recognised under Union law as a non-cooperating state with regard to combating, deterring and eliminating IUU fishing, or as a state allowing for non-sustainable exploitation of living marine resources, such fishing authorisation shall only be granted if it is established that the vessel's fishing operations ceased and the owner took immediate action to remove the vessel from the register of that state.\n10.   The Commission shall arrange for independent ex-ante and ex-post evaluations of each protocol to a Sustainable fisheries partnership agreement, and make them available to the European Parliament and to the Council in good time before it submits to the Council a recommendation to authorise the opening of negotiations for a successor protocol.

In line with the European Green Deal (see summary) and the biodiversity strategy 2030 (see summary), EU fisheries are governed by the precautionary principle in order to limit the impact of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem.\nThe CFP builds on four pillars: fisheries management;international policy;market and trade policy; andfinancial support, i.e. the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (see summary).\nThe CFP establishes rules for the management of fisheries, thus contributing to the conservation of marine biological resources, increased productivity, a fair standard of living for the fisheries sector, stable markets and the availability of food supplies at reasonable prices. Regarding market measures and financial support, the CFP also covers freshwater biological resources and aquaculture activities, along with the processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products.\nKEY POINTS\nFisheries management aims to enable fishers to maximise their catches without threatening the reproduction of fish stocks (their â€˜maximum sustainable yieldâ€™*. To this end, total allowable catches (or â€˜fishing opportunitiesâ€™) are set for most commercial fish stocks. Fishing levels had to conform to maximum sustainable yield levels for all stocks by 2015, if possible, and no later than 2020.\nThe management of fish stocks is based on scientific advice. EU Member States must collect, manage and make available the data needed for scientific advice. This includes biological, environmental and socioeconomic data. Data collection activities are financially supported by the EU.\nBy introducing a landing obligation*, the CFP aims to end the wasteful practice of returning unwanted catches to the sea (discarding). The landing obligation was gradually phased in over the 2015â€“2019 period and is now fully in force, requiring fishers to land all catches of regulated commercial species.\nMultiannual plans set targets for the management of fish stocks. Where the adoption of multiannual plans or management plans that include discard plans takes longer than envisaged, Regulation (EU) 2017/2092 (amending Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013) empowers the European Commission to adopt discard plans.\nTechnical measures are a broad set of rules that govern how, where and when fishers may fish. They are established for all European sea basins, but they differ considerably from one sea basin to another, reflecting regional circumstances.\nThe CFP decentralises decision-making by bringing it closer to the fishing grounds (a process known as regionalisation). It provides for the establishment of advisory councils for each of the geographical areas. Member States with a management interest in a given area can propose detailed measures, which the Commission can adopt into EU law.\nA fisheries control system ensures compliance with the CFP rules, including the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 â€“ see summary). Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 (see summary) lays down the rules that apply to conserving fish stocks in countries with unsustainable fishing.\nNew marketing standards with respect to labelling, quality and traceability allow consumers to be better informed about the origin of the fish they buy and its mode of production.\nThe sustainability principle also applies to EU vessels fishing outside EU waters. The Commission is granted the power to negotiate and conclude sustainable fisheries partnership agreements on behalf of the EU with certain non-EU partner countries. These agreements: allow EU vessels to fish for surplus stocks in the partner countryâ€™s exclusive economic zone* in a legally regulated environment in return for a financial contribution;focus on resource conservation and environmental sustainability, ensuring that all EU vessels are subject to the same rules of control and transparency.\nMember States must support the development of sustainable aquaculture through multiannual national plans.\nReview of the reformed CFP\nEvery year, the Commission publishes a communication outlining progress on the situation of fish stocks and launching a wide public consultation on the fixing of annual fishing opportunities for the following year. This communication assesses the progress made towards sustainable fishing in the EU and reviews the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, the sectorâ€™s socio-economic performance and the implementation of the landing obligation. It also sets out the rationale for the proposal on fishing opportunities for the following year.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2014.\nBACKGROUND\nThe CFP was first launched in 1970. It has undergone several reforms, the most recent of which took effect on 1 January 2014.\nFor further information, see: Common fisheries policy (CFP) (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nMaximum sustainable yield. The highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken on average from a stock under existing average environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process.\nLanding obligation. The requirement for EU vessels to land all catches to end the wasteful practice of returning unwanted catches to the sea.\nExclusive economic zone. An area of coastal water and seabed within a certain distance of a countryâ€™s coastline, to which the country claims exclusive rights for fishing, drilling and other economic activities.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the common fisheries policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 2004/585/EC (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, pp. 22â€“61).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 have been incorporated in the original text.
