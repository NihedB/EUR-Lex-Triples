{"celex_id": "32009R1073", "reference": "14.11.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 300/88\nREGULATION (EC) No 1073/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 October 2009\non common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services, and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA number of substantial changes are to be made to Council Regulation (EEC) No 684/92 of 16 March 1992 on common rules for the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus (3) and to Council Regulation (EC) No 12/98 of 11 December 1997 laying down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road passenger transport services within a Member State (4). In the interests of clarity and simplification, those Regulations should be recast and incorporated into one single regulation.\n(2)\nThe establishment of a common transport policy entails, inter alia, laying down common rules applicable to the international carriage of passengers by road as well as the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national transport services within a Member State.\n(3)\nTo ensure a coherent framework for the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus throughout the Community, this Regulation should apply to all international carriage on Community territory. Carriage from Member States to third countries is still largely covered by bilateral agreements between the Member States and those third countries. Therefore, this Regulation should not apply to that part of the journey within the territory of the Member State of picking up or setting down, as long as the necessary agreements between the Community and the third countries concerned have not been concluded. It should, however, apply to the territory of a Member State crossed in transit.\n(4)\nFreedom to provide services constitutes a basic principle of the common transport policy and requires that carriers from all Member States be guaranteed access to international transport markets without discrimination on grounds of nationality or place of establishment.\n(5)\nThe international carriage of passengers by coach and bus should be conditional on the possession of a Community licence. Carriers should be required to carry a certified true copy of the Community licence aboard each of their vehicles, in order to facilitate effective controls by enforcement authorities, especially those outside the Member State in which the carrier is established. The conditions governing the issue and withdrawal of Community licences, their periods of validity and the detailed rules for their use should be determined. It is also necessary to lay down detailed specifications as regards the layout and other features of the Community licence and the certified copies thereof.\n(6)\nRoadside checks should be carried out without direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of the nationality of the road transport operator or the country of establishment of the road transport operator or of registration of the vehicle.\n(7)\nThere should be provision for flexible arrangements subject to certain conditions for special regular services and certain occasional services, in order to satisfy market demand.\n(8)\nWhile maintaining authorisation arrangements for regular services, certain rules should be amended, particularly as regards authorisation procedures.\n(9)\nThe authorisation for regular services should henceforth be granted subsequent to an authorisation procedure, unless there are clearly specified grounds for refusal attributable to the applicant. The grounds for refusal relating to the relevant market should be either that the service applied for would seriously affect the viability of a comparable service operated under one or more public service contracts on the direct sections concerned or that the principal purpose of the service is not to carry passengers between stops located in different Member States.\n(10)\nNon-resident carriers should be allowed to operate national road passenger services, but regard should be had to the specific characteristics of each form of service. When such cabotage operations are performed, they should be subject to Community legislation such as Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (5) and to national law in force in specified areas in the host Member State.\n(11)\nThe provisions of Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (6) apply to transport undertakings performing a cabotage operation.\n(12)\nWhere regular services are concerned, only regular services provided as part of a regular international service, excluding urban and suburban services, should be opened up to non-resident carriers, subject to certain conditions, and in particular to the legislation in force in the host Member State.\n(13)\nMember States should grant each other mutual assistance with a view to the sound application of this Regulation.\n(14)\nAdministrative formalities should be reduced as far as possible without abandoning the controls and penalties that guarantee the correct application and effective enforcement of this Regulation. To this end, the existing rules on the withdrawal of the Community licence should be clarified and strengthened. The current rules should be adapted to allow the effective sanctioning of serious infringements committed in a Member State other than the Member State of establishment. Penalties should be non-discriminatory and proportionate to the seriousness of the infringements. It should be possible to lodge an appeal in respect of any penalties imposed.\n(15)\nMember States should enter in their national electronic register of road transport undertakings all serious infringements attributable to carriers which have led to the imposition of a penalty.\n(16)\nIn order to facilitate and strengthen the exchange of information between national authorities, Member States should exchange the relevant information through the national contact points set up pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator (7).\n(17)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8).\n(18)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to establish the format of certain documents to be used for the application of this Regulation and to adapt Annexes I and II of this Regulation to technical progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(19)\nMember States should take the necessary measures to implement this Regulation, in particular as regards effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.\n(20)\nIn order to encourage tourism and the use of environmentally friendly means of transport, Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 should be amended to allow drivers engaged in a single occasional service providing international carriage of passengers to postpone their weekly rest period for up to 12 consecutive 24-hour periods if they are involved in passenger transport activities that typically do not include continuous and long driving hours. Such a postponement should only be allowed under very strict conditions which preserve road safety and take into account the working conditions of drivers, inter alia, the obligation to take weekly rest periods immediately before and after the service. The Commission should monitor closely the use of this derogation. If the factual situation which justifies the use of this derogation changes substantially and the derogation results in a deterioration of road safety, the Commission should take appropriate measures.\n(21)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure a coherent framework for the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus throughout the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus within the territory of the Community by carriers for hire or reward or by own-account carriers established in a Member State in accordance with its law, using vehicles which are registered in that Member State and are suitable and intended, by virtue of their construction and equipment, to carry more than nine persons, including the driver, and to the movement of such vehicles when empty in connection with such carriage.\nA change of vehicle or an interruption of carriage to enable part of a journey to be made by another means of transport shall not affect the application of this Regulation.\n2.   In the event of carriage from a Member State to a third country and vice versa, this Regulation shall apply to the part of the journey on the territory of any Member State crossed in transit. It shall not apply to that part of the journey within the territory of the Member State of picking up or setting down, as long as the necessary agreement between the Community and the third country concerned has not been concluded.\n3.   Pending the conclusion of the agreements referred to in paragraph 2, this Regulation shall not affect provisions relating to the carriage from a Member State to a third country and vice-versa contained in bilateral agreements concluded between Member States and those third countries.\n4.   This Regulation shall apply to national road passenger services for hire or reward operated on a temporary basis by a non-resident carrier as provided for in Chapter V.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘international carriage’ means:\n(a)\na journey undertaken by a vehicle the point of departure and the point of arrival of which are in two different Member States, with or without transit through one or more Member States or third countries;\n(b)\na journey undertaken by a vehicle of which the point of departure and the point of arrival are in the same Member State, while the picking up or setting down of passengers is in another Member State or in a third country;\n(c)\na journey undertaken by a vehicle from a Member State to a third country or vice versa, with or without transit through one or more Member States or third countries; or\n(d)\na journey undertaken by a vehicle between third countries, with transit through the territory of one or more Member States;\n2.\n‘regular services’ means services which provide for the carriage of passengers at specified intervals along specified routes, passengers being picked up and set down at predetermined stopping points;\n3.\n‘special regular services’ means regular services, by whomsoever organised, which provide for the carriage of specified categories of passengers to the exclusion of other passengers;\n4.\n‘occasional services’ means services which do not fall within the definition of regular services, including special regular services, and the main characteristic of which is the carriage of groups of passengers constituted on the initiative of the customer or the carrier himself;\n5.\n‘own-account transport operations’ means operations carried out for non-commercial and non-profit-making purposes by a natural or legal person, whereby:\n—\nthe transport activity is only an ancillary activity for that natural or legal person, and\n—\nthe vehicles used are the property of that natural or legal person or have been obtained by that person on deferred terms or have been the subject of a long-term leasing contract and are driven by a member of the staff of the natural or legal person or by the natural person himself or by personnel employed by, or put at the disposal of, the undertaking under a contractual obligation;\n6.\n‘host Member State’ means a Member State in which a carrier operates other than the carrier’s Member State of establishment;\n7.\n‘cabotage operations’ means either:\n—\nnational road passenger services for hire and reward carried out on a temporary basis by a carrier in a host Member State, or\n—\nthe picking up and setting down of passengers within the same Member State, in the course of a regular international service, in compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, provided that it is not the principal purpose of the service;\n8.\n‘serious infringement of Community road transport legislation’ means an infringement which may lead to the loss of good repute in accordance with Article 6(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009, and/or to the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a Community licence.\nArticle 3\nFreedom to provide services\n1.   Any carrier for hire or reward referred to in Article 1 shall be permitted in accordance with this Regulation to carry out regular services, including special regular services and occasional services by coach and bus, without discrimination on grounds of nationality or place of establishment if he:\n(a)\nis authorised in the Member State of establishment to undertake carriage by means of regular services, including special regular services, or occasional services by coach and bus, in accordance with the market access conditions laid down by national legislation;\n(b)\nsatisfies the conditions laid down in accordance with Community rules on admission to the occupation of road passenger transport operator in national and international transport operations; and\n(c)\nmeets legal requirements regarding the standards for drivers and vehicles as laid down, in particular, in Council Directive 92/6/EEC of 10 February 1992 on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community (9), Council Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic (10) and Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers (11).\n2.   Any own-account carrier referred to in Article 1 shall be permitted to carry out the transport services pursuant to Article 5(5) without discrimination on grounds of nationality or place of establishment if he:\n(a)\nis authorised in the Member State of establishment to undertake carriage by coach and bus in accordance with the market-access conditions laid down in national legislation; and\n(b)\nmeets legal requirements regarding the standards for drivers and vehicles as laid down, in particular, in Directives 92/6/EEC, 96/53/EC and 2003/59/EC.\nCHAPTER II\nCOMMUNITY LICENCE AND MARKET ACCESS\nArticle 4\nCommunity licence\n1.   International carriage of passengers by coach and bus shall be carried out subject to possession of a Community licence issued by the competent authorities of the Member State of establishment.\n2.   The competent authorities of the Member State of establishment shall issue the holder with the original of the Community licence, which shall be kept by the carrier, and the number of certified true copies thereof corresponding to the number of vehicles used for the international carriage of passengers at the disposal of the holder of the Community licence, whether those vehicles are wholly owned, or held in another form, particularly under an instalment-purchase, hire or leasing contract.\nThe Community licence and the certified true copies thereof shall correspond to the model set out in Annex II. They shall contain at least two of the security features listed in Annex I.\nThe Commission shall adapt Annexes I and II to technical progress. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 26(2).\nThe Community licence and the certified true copies thereof shall bear the seal of the issuing authority as well as a signature and a serial number. The serial numbers of the Community licence and the certified true copies thereof shall be recorded in the national electronic register of road transport undertakings provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 as part of the data relating to the carrier.\n3.   The Community licence shall be issued in the name of the carrier and shall be non-transferable. A certified true copy of the Community licence shall be kept in each of the carrier’s vehicles and shall be presented at the request of any authorised inspecting officer.\n4.   The Community licence shall be issued for renewable periods of up to 10 years.\nCommunity licences and certified true copies thereof issued before the date of application of this Regulation shall remain valid until their date of expiry.\n5.   Whenever an application for a Community licence is lodged, or a Community licence is renewed in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article, the competent authorities of the Member State of establishment shall verify whether the carrier satisfies or continues to satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 3(1).\n6.   Where the conditions referred to in Article 3(1) are not satisfied, the competent authorities of the Member State of establishment shall refuse to issue or renew or shall withdraw a Community licence by means of a reasoned decision.\n7.   Member States shall guarantee the right of the applicant for, or holder of, a Community licence to appeal against a decision by the competent authorities of the Member State of establishment to refuse or withdraw this licence.\n8.   Member States may decide that the Community licence shall also be valid for national transport operations.\nArticle 5\nAccess to the market\n1.   Regular services shall be open to all, subject, where appropriate, to compulsory reservation.\nSuch services shall be subject to authorisation in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III.\nRegular services from a Member State to a third country and vice versa shall be subject to authorisation in accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Member State and the third country and, where appropriate, the transited Member State, as long as the necessary agreement between the Community and the third country concerned has not been concluded.\nThe regular nature of the service shall not be affected by any adjustment to the service operating conditions.\nThe organisation of parallel or temporary services, serving the same public as existing regular services, the non-serving of certain stops and the serving of additional stops on existing regular services shall be governed by the same rules as those applicable to existing regular services.\n2.   Special regular services shall include:\n(a)\nthe carriage of workers between home and work;\n(b)\nthe carriage of school pupils and students to and from the educational institution.\nThe fact that a special service may be varied according to the needs of users shall not affect its classification as a regular service.\nSpecial regular services shall not be subject to authorisation in accordance with Chapter III where they are covered by a contract concluded between the organiser and the carrier.\n3.   Occasional services shall not require authorisation in accordance with Chapter III.\nHowever, the organisation of parallel or temporary services comparable to existing regular services and serving the same public as the latter shall be subject to authorisation in accordance with the procedure laid down in Chapter III.\nOccasional services shall not cease to be occasional services solely on the grounds that they are provided at certain intervals.\nOccasional services may be provided by a group of carriers acting on behalf of the same contractor, and travellers may catch a connection en route, with a different carrier of the same group, on the territory of a Member State.\nThe Commission shall establish the procedures for the names of such carriers and the connection points en route to be communicated to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 26(2).\n4.   Empty journeys by vehicles in connection with the transport operations referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2, and in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3, shall likewise not require authorisation.\n5.   Own-account transport operations shall be exempt from any system of authorisation but shall be subject to a system of certificates.\nThe certificates shall be issued by the competent authorities of the Member State in which the vehicle is registered and shall be valid for the entire journey including transit.\nThe Commission shall establish the format of the certificates. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 26(2).\nCHAPTER III\nREGULAR SERVICES SUBJECT TO AUTHORISATION\nArticle 6\nNature of authorisation\n1.   Authorisations shall be issued in the name of the carrier and shall be non-transferable. However, a carrier who has received an authorisation may, with the consent of the competent authority of the Member State in whose territory the point of departure is situated, hereinafter referred to as the ‘authorising authority’, operate the service through a subcontractor. In this case, the name of the subcontractor and its role shall be indicated in the authorisation. The subcontractor shall satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 3(1). For the purposes of this paragraph, the point of departure shall mean ‘one of the termini of the service’.\nIn the case of undertakings associated for the purpose of operating a regular service, the authorisation shall be issued in the names of all the undertakings and shall state the names of all the operators. It shall be given to the undertaking that manages the operation and copies shall be given to the other undertakings.\n2.   The period of validity of an authorisation shall not exceed 5 years. It may be set at less either at the request of the applicant or by mutual consent of the competent authorities of the Member States on whose territory passengers are picked up or set down.\n3.   Authorisations shall specify the following:\n(a)\nthe type of service;\n(b)\nthe route of the service, giving in particular the point of departure and the point of arrival;\n(c)\nthe period of validity of the authorisation;\n(d)\nthe stops and the timetable.\n4.   The Commission shall establish the format of the authorisations. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 26(2).\n5.   Authorisations shall entitle their holder(s) to operate regular services in the territories of all Member States over which the routes of the service pass.\n6.   The operator of a regular service may use additional vehicles to deal with temporary and exceptional situations. Such additional vehicles may be used only under the same conditions as set out in the authorisation referred to in paragraph 3.\nIn this case, the carrier shall ensure that the following documents are carried on the vehicle:\n(a)\na copy of the authorisation of the regular service;\n(b)\na copy of the contract between the operator of the regular service and the undertaking providing the additional vehicles or an equivalent document;\n(c)\na certified true copy of the Community licence issued to the operator providing the additional vehicles for the service.\nArticle 7\nSubmission of application for authorisation\n1.   Applications for authorisation of regular services shall be submitted to the authorising authority.\n2.   The Commission shall establish the format of the applications. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 26(2).\n3.   Persons applying for authorisation shall provide any further information which they consider relevant or which is requested by the authorising authority, in particular a driving schedule making it possible to monitor compliance with Community legislation on driving and rest periods and a copy of the Community licence.\nArticle 8\nAuthorising procedure\n1.   Authorisations shall be issued in agreement with the authorities of all the Member States in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down. The authorising authority shall forward to such authorities, as well as to the competent authorities of Member States whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down, a copy of the application, together with copies of any other relevant documentation, and its assessment.\n2.   The competent authorities of the Member States whose agreement has been requested shall notify the authorising authority of their decision on the application within 2 months. This time limit shall be calculated from the date of receipt of the request for agreement which is shown in the acknowledgement of receipt. If the decision received from the competent authorities of the Member States whose agreement has been requested is negative, it shall contain a proper statement of reasons. If the authorising authority does not receive a reply within 2 months, the authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement and the authorising authority may grant the authorisation.\nThe authorities of the Member States whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may notify the authorising authority of their comments within the time limit laid down in the first subparagraph.\n3.   The authorising authority shall take a decision on the application within 4 months of the date of submission of the application by the carrier.\n4.   Authorisation shall be granted unless:\n(a)\nthe applicant is unable to provide the service which is the subject of the application with equipment directly available to him;\n(b)\nthe applicant has not complied with national or international legislation on road transport, and in particular the conditions and requirements relating to authorisations for international road passenger services, or has committed serious infringements of Community road transport legislation in particular with regard to the rules applicable to vehicles and driving and rest periods for drivers;\n(c)\nin the case of an application for renewal of authorisation, the conditions of authorisation have not been complied with;\n(d)\na Member State decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the service concerned would seriously affect the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts conforming to Community law on the direct sections concerned. In such a case, the Member State shall set up criteria, on a non-discriminatory basis, for determining whether the service applied for would seriously affect the viability of the abovementioned comparable service and shall communicate them to the Commission, upon its request;\n(e)\na Member State decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the principal purpose of the service is not to carry passengers between stops located in different Member States.\nIn the event that an existing international coach and bus service is seriously affecting the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts conforming to Community law on the direct sections concerned, due to exceptional reasons which could not have been foreseen at the time of granting the authorisation, a Member State may, with the agreement of the Commission, suspend or withdraw the authorisation to run the international coach and bus service after having given 6 months’ notice to the carrier.\nThe fact that a carrier offers lower prices than those offered by other road carriers or the fact that the link in question is already operated by other road carriers shall not in itself constitute justification for rejecting the application.\n5.   The authorising authority and the competent authorities of all the Member States involved in the procedure to reach the agreement provided for in paragraph 1 may refuse applications only on the basis of reasons provided for in this Regulation.\n6.   Having completed the procedure laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5, the authorising authority shall grant the authorisation or formally refuse the application.\nDecisions refusing an application shall state the reasons on which they are based. Member States shall ensure that transport undertakings are given the opportunity to make representations in the event of their application being refused.\nThe authorising authority shall inform all the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of its decision, sending them a copy of any authorisation.\n7.   If the procedure for reaching the agreement referred to in paragraph 1 does not enable the authorising authority to decide on an application, the matter may be referred to the Commission within the time limit of 2 months calculated from the date of communication of a negative decision by one or more of the Member States consulted pursuant to paragraph 1.\n8.   After having consulted the Member States concerned, the Commission shall, within 4 months from receipt of the communication from the authorising authority, take a decision which shall take effect 30 days after the notification to the Member States concerned.\n9.   The Commission decision shall continue to apply until an agreement is reached between the Member States concerned.\nArticle 9\nRenewal and alteration of authorisation\nArticle 8 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to applications for the renewal of authorisations or for alteration of the conditions under which the services subject to authorisation must be carried out.\nIn the event of a minor alteration to the operating conditions, in particular adjustment of intervals, fares and timetables, the authorising authority need only supply the other Member States concerned with information relating to the alteration.\nThe Member States concerned may agree that the authorising authority alone shall decide on alterations to the conditions under which a service is operated.\nArticle 10\nLapse of an authorisation\n1.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road (12), an authorisation for a regular service shall lapse at the end of its period of validity or 3 months after the authorising authority has received notice from its holder of his intention to withdraw the service. Such notice shall contain a proper statement of reasons.\n2.   Where demand for a service has ceased to exist, the period of notice provided for in paragraph 1 shall be of 1 month.\n3.   The authorising authority shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States concerned that the authorisation has lapsed.\n4.   The holder of the authorisation shall notify users of the service concerned of its withdrawal 1 month in advance by means of appropriate publicity.\nArticle 11\nObligations of carriers\n1.   Save in the event of force majeure, the operator of a regular service shall, until the authorisation expires, take all measures to guarantee a transport service that fulfils the standards of continuity, regularity and capacity and complies with the other conditions laid down by the competent authority in accordance with Article 6(3).\n2.   The carrier shall display the route of the service, the bus stops, the timetable, the fares and the conditions of carriage in such a way as to ensure that such information is readily available to all users.\n3.   Without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007, it shall be possible for the Member States concerned, by common agreement and in agreement with the holder of the authorisation, to make changes to the operating conditions governing a regular service.\nCHAPTER IV\nOCCASIONAL SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES EXEMPT FROM AUTHORISATION\nArticle 12\nControl documents\n1.   Occasional services shall be carried out under cover of a journey form with the exception of the services referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 5(3).\n2.   A carrier operating occasional services shall fill out a journey form before each journey.\n3.   The journey form shall contain at least the following information:\n(a)\nthe type of service;\n(b)\nthe main itinerary;\n(c)\nthe carrier(s) involved.\n4.   The books of journey forms shall be supplied by the competent authorities of the Member State where the carrier is established or by bodies appointed by those authorities.\n5.   The Commission shall establish the format of the journey form, the book of journey forms and the way in which they are used. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 26(2).\n6.   In the case of the special regular services referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 5(2), the contract or a certified true copy thereof shall serve as the control document.\nArticle 13\nLocal excursions\nWithin the framework of an international occasional service, a carrier may carry out occasional services (local excursions) in a Member State other than that in which it is established.\nSuch services shall be intended for non-resident passengers previously carried by the same carrier on one of the international services mentioned in the first paragraph and shall be carried out with the same vehicle or another vehicle from the same carrier or group of carriers.\nCHAPTER V\nCABOTAGE\nArticle 14\nGeneral principle\nAny carrier who operates road passenger transport services for hire or reward and who holds a Community licence shall be permitted, under the conditions laid down in this Chapter and without discrimination on grounds of the carrier’s nationality or place of establishment, to operate the cabotage operations as specified in Article 15.\nArticle 15\nAuthorised cabotage operations\nCabotage operations shall be authorised for the following services:\n(a)\nspecial regular services provided that they are covered by a contract concluded between the organiser and the carrier;\n(b)\noccasional services;\n(c)\nregular services, performed by a carrier not resident in the host Member State in the course of a regular international service in accordance with this Regulation with the exception of transport services meeting the needs of an urban centre or conurbation, or transport needs between it and the surrounding areas. Cabotage operations shall not be performed independently of such international service.\nArticle 16\nRules applicable to cabotage operations\n1.   The performance of the cabotage operations shall be subject, save as otherwise provided in Community legislation, to the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in force in the host Member State with regard to the following:\n(a)\nthe conditions governing the transport contract;\n(b)\nthe weights and dimensions of road vehicles;\n(c)\nthe requirements relating to the carriage of certain categories of passengers, namely schoolchildren, children and persons with reduced mobility;\n(d)\nthe driving time and rest periods;\n(e)\nthe value added tax (VAT) on transport services.\nThe weights and dimensions referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph may, where appropriate, exceed those applicable in the carrier’s Member State of establishment, but they may under no circumstances exceed the limits set by the host Member State for national traffic or the technical characteristics mentioned in the proofs referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 96/53/EC.\n2.   Save as otherwise provided in Community legislation, cabotage operations which form part of the transport services provided for in Article 15(c) shall be subject to the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in force in the host Member State regarding authorisations, tendering procedures, the routes to be operated and the regularity, continuity and frequency of services as well as itineraries.\n3.   The technical standards of construction and equipment which must be met by vehicles used to carry out cabotage operations shall be those laid down for vehicles put into circulation in international transport.\n4.   The national laws, regulations and administrative provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied to non-resident carriers under the same conditions as those imposed on carriers established in the host Member State, so as to prevent any discrimination on grounds of nationality or place of establishment.\nArticle 17\nControl documents for cabotage operations\n1.   Cabotage operations in the form of occasional services shall be carried out under cover of a journey form as referred to in Article 12 which shall be kept on board the vehicle and be presented at the request of any authorised inspecting officer.\n2.   The following information shall be entered in the journey form:\n(a)\nthe points of departure and arrival of the service;\n(b)\nthe date of departure and the date on which the service ends.\n3.   The journey forms shall be supplied in books as referred to in Article 12 certified by the competent authority or body in the Member State of establishment.\n4.
