The Treaty establishing the European Community provides for Community action to be aimed at encouraging the development of youth exchanges and of exchanges of socio-educational instructors.2. The Community has been assigned the task among others of promoting harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and social protection, and a rise in living standards and in the quality of life.3. The promotion of employment, improvement of living and working conditions, and combating exclusion are mentioned among the specific objections of the social provisions of the Treaty.4. The European Parliament and the Council have by Decision No 1031/2000/EC of 13 April 2000(1) established the \"Youth\" Community action programme. One objective of this programme is to encourage young people's initiative, enterprise and creativity so that they can play an active role in society.5. On 9 November 2000 the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, adopted a Resolution on the social inclusion of young people(2).6. On 8 February 1999, the Council and the Ministers of Youth, meeting within the Council, adopted a Resolution on youth participation(3) which puts the inclusion of youth in institutions of social, political, cultural and economic life in the foreground.7. In a Resolution on a youth policy for Europe(4), adopted by the European Parliament on 9 March 1999, the Member States and the Commission were encouraged to act promptly to approve knowledge acquired through non-formal learning, and to ensure that it is recognised in the labour market.8. In the Presidency conclusions of the European Council meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 one of the targets set was for the Member States, in accordance with their constitutional provisions, and also the Council and the Commission to take certain necessary steps within their areas of competence to fulfil inter alia the target of developing a common European format for curriculum vitae to be used on a voluntary basis in order to facilitate mobility by helping the assessment by both educational and training institutions and employers of knowledge acquired. The achievement of the priority objective of mobility will be based in particular on the action plan for mobility, approved by the Heads of State or Government at the European Council in Nice, and on a draft recommendation on mobility within the Community for students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers which, according to the conclusions of the European Council in Stockholm, it is intended to adopt by June 2001.9. The memorandum on lifelong learning presented by the Commission to the Council (Education/Youth) of 9 November 2000, proposed consulting all the relevant public and private actors on six main topics including non-formal learning and the need to invest more in human resources.10. Under its Decision 2000/819/EC of 20 December 2000(5), the Council established a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (2001 to 2005).11. In the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 entrepreneurship is mentioned as one of the five basic skills which should be provided through lifelong learning.12. In Council Decision 2001/63/EC of 19 January 2001 on guidelines for Member States' employment policies for the year 2001(6), the development of entrepreneurship and job creation is identified as one of the four pillars,THEREFORE.II13. ARE OF THE VIEW that young people's initiative, enterprise and creativity are a key resource that should be better promoted in various spheres of society for the development of their own personal and social skills as well as being an important precondition for attaining the Union's strategic goal of becoming the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, more and better job opportunities and greater social cohesion.14. WELCOME in this context the emphasis placed by the Lisbon Conclusions on lifelong learning as a basic component of the European social model.15. EMPHASISE the importance of young people's own initiative and creativity in combating racism, xenophobia and intolerance.16. EMPHASISE the importance of young people's initiative, enterprise and creativity when it comes to their ability to prevent social, political and cultural exclusion and the importance of strengthening young people's power and influence over their life situation.17.
