{"celex_id": "32021R1230", "reference": "30.7.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 274/20\nREGULATION (EU) 2021/1230 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 14 July 2021\non cross-border payments in the Union\n(codification)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) has been substantially amended several times (5). In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nFor the proper functioning of the internal market and in order to facilitate cross-border trade within the Union, it is essential that the charges for cross-border payments in euro are the same as for corresponding payments within a Member State.\n(3)\nIt is not advisable to apply the principle of equality of charges for payment instruments which are mainly or exclusively paper-based, such as cheques, since, by their very nature, they cannot be processed as efficiently as electronic payments.\n(4)\nThe principle of equality of charges should apply to payments initiated or terminated on paper or in cash which are processed electronically in the course of the payment execution chain, excluding cheques, and to all charges linked directly or indirectly to a payment transaction, including charges linked to a contract. Indirect charges include charges for setting up a permanent payment order or fees for using a payment card or debit or credit card, which should be the same for national and cross-border payment transactions within the Union.\n(5)\nIn order to prevent the fragmentation of payment markets, it is appropriate to apply the principle of equality of charges. For that purpose, a national payment having the same characteristics as, or very similar characteristics to, the cross-border payment should be identified for each category of cross-border payment transaction. It should be possible, inter alia, to use the following criteria to identify the national payment corresponding to a cross-border payment: the channel used to initiate, execute and terminate the payment, the degree of automation, any payment guarantee, customer status and relationship with the payment service provider, or the payment instrument used, as defined in point (14) of Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). Those criteria should not be considered to be exhaustive.\n(6)\nCompetent authorities should issue guidelines to identify corresponding payments where they consider it necessary. The Commission, assisted, where appropriate, by the Payments Committee established by Article 85(1) of Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), should provide adequate guidance and assist the competent authorities.\n(7)\nIn order to facilitate the functioning of the internal market and to avoid inequalities between payment service users in the euro area and non-euro area Member States in respect of cross-border payments in euro, it is necessary to ensure that charges for cross-border payments in euro within the Union are aligned with charges for corresponding national payments made in the national currency of the Member State in which the payment service provider of the payment service user is located. A payment service provider is considered to be located in the Member State in which it provides its services to the payment service user.\n(8)\nCurrency conversion charges represent a significant cost of cross-border payments when different currencies are in use in the Member State of the payer and the Member State of the payee. Article 45 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 requires the charges and the exchange rate used to be transparent, Article 52, point (3), of that Directive specifies information requirements with regard to payment transactions covered by a framework contract and Article 59(2) of that Directive covers the information requirements for parties offering currency conversion services at an automated teller machine (ATM) or at the point of sale. It is necessary to provide for additional measures in order to protect consumers against excessive charges for currency conversion services and to ensure that consumers are given the information they need to choose the best currency conversion option.\n(9)\nThe measures to be implemented should be appropriate, adequate and cost-effective. At the same time, in situations in which the payer is confronted with different currency conversion options at an ATM or at the point of sale, the information provided should make comparison possible, to allow the payer to make an informed choice.\n(10)\nTo achieve comparability, currency conversion charges for all card-based payments should be expressed in the same way, namely as percentage mark-ups over the latest available euro foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). A mark-up might have to be based on a rate derived from two ECB rates in the case of a conversion between two non-euro currencies.\n(11)\nIn accordance with the general information requirements concerning currency conversion charges laid down in Directive (EU) 2015/2366, providers of currency conversion services should disclose information on their currency conversion charges prior to the initiation of the payment transaction. Parties that offer currency conversion services at an ATM or at the point of sale should provide information on their charges for such services in a clear and accessible manner, for example by displaying their charges at the counter, or digitally on the terminal, or on-screen in the case of online purchases. In addition to the information referred to in Article 59(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, those parties should provide, prior to the initiation of the payment, explicit information on the amount to be paid to the payee in the currency used by the payee and the total amount to be paid by the payer in the currency of the payer’s account. The amount to be paid in the currency used by the payee should express the price of the goods or services to be bought and might be displayed at the check-out rather than on the payment terminal. The currency used by the payee is in general the local currency, but according to the principle of contractual freedom might in some cases be another Union currency. The total amount to be paid by the payer in the currency of the payer’s account should consist of the price of the goods or services and the currency conversion charges. In addition, both amounts should be documented on the receipt or on another durable medium.\n(12)\nWith regard to Article 59(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, where a currency conversion service is offered at an ATM or at the point of sale, it should be possible for the payer to refuse that service and to pay in the currency used by the payee instead.\n(13)\nIn order to enable payers to compare the charges of currency conversion options at an ATM or at the point of sale, the payers’ payment service providers should not only include fully comparable information on the applicable charges for currency conversion in the terms and conditions of their framework contract, but should also make that information public on a broadly available and easily accessible electronic platform, in particular on their customer websites, on their home-banking websites and on their mobile banking applications, in an easily understandable and accessible manner. This would cater for the development of comparison websites to make it easier for consumers to compare prices when travelling or shopping abroad. In addition, payers’ payment service providers should remind payers about the applicable currency conversion charges when a card-based payment is made in another currency, through the use of broadly available and easily accessible electronic communication channels, such as SMS messages, e-mails or push notifications through the payer’s mobile banking application. Payment service providers should agree with payment service users on the electronic communication channel through which they will provide the information on currency conversion charges, taking into consideration the most effective channel for reaching the payer. Payment service providers should also accept requests from payment service users to opt out of receiving the electronic messages containing information on the currency conversion charges.\n(14)\nPeriodic reminders are appropriate in situations in which the payer stays abroad for longer periods of time, for example where the payer is posted or studies abroad, or where the payer regularly uses a card for online purchases in the local currency. An obligation to provide such reminders would ensure that the payer is informed when considering the different currency conversion options.\n(15)\nIt is important to facilitate the execution of cross-border payments by payment service providers. In that respect, standardisation should be promoted as regards, in particular, the use of the international payment account number identifier (IBAN) and the business identifier code (BIC). It is therefore appropriate that payment service providers provide payment service users with the IBAN and the BIC for the account in question.\n(16)\nIn order to guarantee the continuous, timely and efficient provision of balance-of-payments statistics in the framework of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), it is desirable to ensure that it remains possible to collect readily available payments data, such as the IBAN, the BIC and the amount of the transaction, or basic, aggregated payments data for different payment instruments, if the collection process does not disrupt the automated payments processing and can be fully automated. This Regulation does not affect reporting obligations for other policy purposes, such as for the prevention of money laundering or terrorist financing, or for fiscal purposes.\n(17)\nCompetent authorities should be empowered to fulfil their monitoring duties efficiently and to take all necessary measures to ensure that payment service providers comply with this Regulation.\n(18)\nIn order to ensure that redress is possible where this Regulation has been incorrectly applied, Member States should provide for adequate and effective complaint and redress procedures for settling any dispute between the payment service user and the payment service provider. It is also important that competent authorities and out-of-court complaint and redress bodies be designated.\n(19)\nIt is essential to ensure that the competent authorities and out-of-court complaint and redress bodies within the Union actively cooperate for the smooth and timely resolution of cross-border disputes under this Regulation. It should be possible for such cooperation to take the form of an exchange of information regarding the law or legal practice in their jurisdictions, or of a transfer or takeover of complaint and redress procedures if appropriate.\n(20)\nIt is necessary that Member States lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in national law for failure to comply with this Regulation.\n(21)\nExtending the application of this Regulation to currencies other than the euro would have clear benefits, especially in terms of the number of payments covered. In order to allow Member States which do not have the euro as their currency to extend the application of this Regulation to cross-border payments denominated in their national currency, a notification procedure should be provided for.\n(22)\nThe Commission should submit to the European Parliament, to the Council, to the ECB and to the European Economic and Social Committee a report on the application of the rule equalising the cost of cross-border payments in euro with the cost of national transactions in national currencies and on the effectiveness of the information requirements on currency conversion set out in this Regulation. The Commission should also analyse further possibilities, and the technical feasibility of those possibilities, of extending the equal charges rule to all Union currencies and of further improving the transparency and comparability of currency conversion charges, as well as the possibility of disabling and enabling the option of accepting currency conversion by parties other than the payer’s payment service provider.\n(23)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation lays down rules on cross-border payments and on the transparency of currency conversion charges within the Union.\n2.

A party providing currency conversion services at an ATM or at the point of sale shall clearly display the information referred to in paragraph 1 at the ATM or at the point of sale. Prior to the initiation of the payment transaction, that party shall also inform the payer of the possibility of paying in the currency used by the payee and having the currency conversion subsequently performed by the payer’s payment service provider. The information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also be made available to the payer on a durable medium following the initiation of the payment transaction.\n5.   The payer’s payment service provider shall, for each payment card that was issued to the payer by the payer’s payment service provider and that is linked to the same account, send to the payer an electronic message with the information referred to in paragraph 1, without undue delay after the payer’s payment service provider receives a payment order for a cash withdrawal at an ATM or a payment at the point of sale that is denominated in any Union currency that is different from the currency of the payer’s account.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, such a message shall be sent once every month in which the payer’s payment service provider receives from the payer a payment order denominated in the same currency.\n6.

Those charges shall be appropriate and in line with the costs. They shall be agreed between the payment service provider and the payment service user. The payment service provider shall inform the payment service user of the amount of the additional charges in good time before the payment service user is bound by such an agreement.\n3.   Where appropriate, with regard to the nature of the payment transaction concerned, for all invoicing of goods and services in the Union, a supplier of goods and services that accepts payments covered by this Regulation shall communicate its IBAN and the BIC of its payment service provider to its customers.\nArticle 7\nBalance of payments reporting obligations\n1.   Member States shall not provide for settlement-based national reporting obligations on payment service providers for balance of payments statistics relating to payment transactions of their customers.\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, Member States may collect aggregated data or other relevant readily available information, provided that such collection has no impact on the straight-through processing of the payments and can be fully automated by payment service providers.\nArticle 8\nCompetent authorities\nMember States shall designate the competent authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\nMember States shall notify the Commission without delay of any change concerning the competent authorities of which it was notified in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009.\nMember States shall require the competent authorities to monitor compliance with this Regulation effectively and take all necessary measures to ensure such compliance.\nArticle 9\nComplaint procedures for alleged infringements of this Regulation\n1.   Member States shall provide for procedures which allow payment service users and other interested parties to submit complaints to the competent authorities with regard to alleged infringements of this Regulation by payment service providers.\n2.   Where appropriate, and without prejudice to the right to bring proceedings before a court in accordance with national procedural law, the competent authorities shall inform any party that has submitted a complaint of the existence of the out-of-court complaint and redress procedures provided for in accordance with Article 10.\nArticle 10\nOut-of-court complaint and redress procedures\n1.

For those purposes, Member States shall designate the responsible bodies.\n2.   Member States shall notify the Commission without delay of any change concerning the bodies of which it was notified in accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009.\n3.   Member States may provide that this Article applies only to payment service users which are consumers or micro-enterprises. In that event, Member States shall inform the Commission accordingly.\nArticle 11\nCross-border cooperation\nThe competent authorities and the bodies responsible for the out-of-court complaint and redress procedures of the different Member States, referred to in Articles 8 and 10, shall actively and expeditiously cooperate in solving cross-border disputes. Member States shall ensure that such cooperation takes place.\nArticle 12\nPenalties\nMember States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Member States shall, without delay, notify the Commission of any amendment affecting the rules and measures of which it was notified in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009.\nArticle 13\nApplication to currencies other than the euro\nA Member State that does not have the euro as its currency and that decides to extend the application of this Regulation to its national currency shall notify the Commission accordingly.\nThat notification shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The extended application of this Regulation to the national currency of the Member State concerned shall take effect 14 days after such publication.\nArticle 14\nReview\n1.   By 19 April 2022, the Commission shall present to the European Parliament, the Council, the ECB and the European Economic and Social Committee a report on the application and impact of this Regulation, which shall contain, in particular:\n(a)\nan evaluation of the way payment service providers apply Article 3 of this Regulation;\n(b)\nan evaluation of the development of volumes and charges for national and cross-border payments in national currencies of Member States and in euro since the date of adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/518 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), namely, 19 March 2019;\n(c)\nan evaluation of the impact of Article 3 of this Regulation on the development of currency conversion charges and other charges related to payment services, both to payers and payees;\n(d)\nan evaluation of the estimated impact of amending Article 3(1) of this Regulation to cover currencies of all Member States;\n(e)\nan evaluation of how providers of currency conversion services apply the information requirements laid down in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation and the national laws implementing Article 45(1), Article 52, point (3), and Article 59(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and whether those rules have enhanced the transparency of currency conversion charges;\n(f)\nan evaluation of whether and to what extent providers of currency conversion services have faced difficulties with the practical application of Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation and the national laws implementing Article 45(1), Article 52, point (3), and Article 59(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366;\n(g)\na cost-benefit analysis of communication channels and technologies that are used by, or are available to, providers of currency conversion services and that can further improve the transparency of currency conversion charges, including an evaluation of whether there are certain channels which payment service providers should be required to offer for the sending of the information referred to in Article 4; that analysis shall also include an assessment of the technical feasibility of disclosing simultaneously the information referred to in Article 4(1) and (3) of this Regulation, prior to the initiation of each transaction, for all currency conversion options available at an ATM or at the point of sale;\n(h)\na cost-benefit analysis of introducing the possibility for payers to block the option of currency conversion offered by a party other than the payer’s payment service provider at an ATM or at the point of sale and to change their preferences in that regard;\n(i)\na cost-benefit analysis of introducing a requirement for the payer’s payment service provider, to apply, when providing currency conversion services in relation to an individual payment transaction, the currency conversion rate applicable at the moment of initiation of the transaction when clearing and settling the transaction.\n2.   The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover at least the period from 15 December 2019 until 19 October 2021.
