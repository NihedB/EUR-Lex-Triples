However, Member States may exclude the confiscation of property the value of which corresponds to the proceeds from crime in minor cases. The words 'property`, 'proceeds`, and 'confiscation` shall have the same meaning as in Article 1 of the 1990 Convention.3. Each Member State shall ensure that its legislation and procedures enable it to permit the identification and tracing of suspected proceeds from crime at the request of another Member State where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a criminal offence has been committed. Such legislation and procedures shall enable assistance to be given at the earliest possible stages in an investigation, and to that end, Member States will endeavour to restrict their use of the optional gorunds for refusal in respect of other Member States under paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 18 of the 1990 Convention.Article 2 1.

The General Secretariat shall distribute the guides to Member States, the European Judicial Network and Europol.3. Each Member State shall ensure that the guide referred to in paragraph 1 is kept up to date and that any changes are sent to the General Secretariat of the Council for translation and distribution in accordance with paragraph 2.Article 3 Member States shall give the same priority to all requests from other Member States which relate to asset identification, tracing, freezing or seizing, and confiscation as is given to such measures in domestic proceedings.Article 4 1. Member States shall encourage direct contact between investigators, investigating magistrates and prosecutors of Member States making appropriate use of available cooperation arrangements, to ensure that requests for assistance through formal channels are not made unnecessarily. When a formal request is necessary, the requesting State shall ensure that it is properly prepared and meets all the requirements of the requested State.2.

Those steps shall include such measures as may be necessary to ensure that assets which are the subject of a request from another Member State may be frozen or seized expeditiously so that a later confiscation request is not frustrated.2. Where, in the course of fulfilling a request for legal assistance in one area of a Member State the need arises to pursue further enquiries in another area of that Member State, the Member State shall, where it is not contrary to its law, take all possible steps to enable the necessary assistance to be rendered without the need for preparation of a further letter of request.3. Where the execution of a request leads to the need to pursue further enquiries on a related issue, and the requesting State issues a supplementary letter of request, the requested State shall, where it is not contrary to its law, take all possible steps to expedite the execution of such a supplementary request.Article 6 1. Member States shall ensure that arrangements are in place to acquaint their judiciary with best practice in international cooperation in the identification, tracing, freezing or seizing, and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime.2.

Subject to paragraph 2, Member States shall take all appropriate steps to implement this Joint Action as soon as it enters into force, and shall ensure that its contents are brought to the attention of their relevant national and local authorities.2.

The request for assistance must be properly prepared and meet the requirements that the requested EU country has set down for such requests. In case the request is labelled as “urgent”, the requesting country must provide the reasons thereof.

It requires each EU country to take the necessary measures to enable it to confiscate, either wholly or in part, instrumentalities and proceeds from criminal offences that are punishable by deprivation of liberty for more than one year, or property of a value corresponding to such proceeds.\nIn relation to tax offences, EU countries may use procedures other than criminal procedures to deprive the perpetrator of the proceeds of the offence. The aim of the framework decision is to ensure that all EU countries have effective rules governing the confiscation of proceeds from crime, especially in relation to the onus of proof regarding the source of assets held by a person convicted of an offence related to organised crime.\nLast updated: 14.03.2011", "tags": ["fight against crime", "seizure of goods", "money laundering", "cooperation in home affairs", "judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU", "EU police cooperation", "organised crime"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
