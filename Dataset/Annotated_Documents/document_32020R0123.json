{"celex_id": "32020R0123", "reference": "30.1.2020\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 25/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2020/123\nof 27 January 2020\nfixing for 2020 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 43(3) of the Treaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) requires that conservation measures be adopted, taking into account available scientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and other advisory bodies, as well as any advice received from advisory councils.\n(3)\nIt is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing opportunities should be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) established in Article 2(2) of that Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(1) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery.\n(4)\nThe total allowable catch (TAC) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings of the advisory councils.\n(5)\nIn accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the landing obligation applies fully from 1 January 2019 and all species subject to catch limits should be landed. Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, when the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock applies, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches. On the basis of the joint recommendations submitted by the Member States and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the Commission adopted a number of delegated Regulations laying down details for the implementation of the landing obligation in the form of specific discard plans applicable on a temporary basis for a maximum period of three years.\n(6)\nThe fishing opportunities for stocks of species falling under the landing obligation should take into account the fact that discarding is in principle no longer allowed. Therefore, the fishing opportunities should be based on the advice figure for total catches (instead of the advice figure for wanted catches), as provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The amounts that, by way of exception, may continue to be discarded during the operation of the landing obligation should be deducted from that advice figure for total catches.\n(7)\nThere are certain stocks for which ICES has issued scientific advice for no catches. If TACs for those stocks are established at the level indicated in the scientific advice, the obligation to land all catches, including by-catches from those stocks, in mixed fisheries would lead to the phenomenon of ‘choke species’. In order to strike the right balance between continuing fisheries in view of the potentially severe socio-economic implications, and the need to achieve a good biological status for those stocks, taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) at the same time, it is appropriate to establish specific TACs for by-catches for those stocks. The level of those TACs should be such that mortality for those stocks is decreased and that it provides incentives for improvements in selectivity and avoidance. In order to guarantee to the extent possible the use of fishing opportunities in mixed fisheries in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is appropriate to establish a pool for quota exchanges for those Member States that have no quota to cover their unavoidable by-catches.\n(8)\nIn order to reduce catches of the stocks for which by-catch TACs are set, fishing opportunities for the fisheries in which fish from those stocks is caught should be set at levels that help the biomass of vulnerable stocks to recover to sustainable levels. Technical and control measures that are intrinsically linked to fishing opportunities should also be established to prevent illegal discarding.\n(9)\nAccording to scientific advice, the spawning-stock biomass of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in the Celtic Sea, Channel, Irish Sea and southern North Sea (ICES divisions 4b, 4c, 7a, and 7d to 7h) has been declining since 2009 and is currently below MSY Btrigger and just above Blim. The fishing mortality, due to the measures taken by the Union has decreased and is currently below FMSY. However, recruitment is low, fluctuating without trend since 2008. Therefore, the catch limits should be continued, while ensuring that the target fishing mortality for this stock is in line with MSY.\n(10)\nIn accordance with the Western Waters multiannual plan established by Regulation (EU) 2019/472 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), the target fishing mortality, in line with the ranges of FMSY defined in Article 2 of that Regulation, is to be achieved as soon as possible, and on progressive and incremental basis by 2020 for the stocks listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and shall be maintained thereafter within the ranges of FMSY, in accordance with Article 4 of that Regulation. The overall fishing mortality for seabass in ICES divisions 8a and 8b should therefore be set in line with MSY, taking into account commercial and recreational catches and including discards (2 533 tonnes altogether according to the ICES advice). Member States are to take appropriate measures to ensure that the fishing mortality from their fleets and from their recreational fishermen does not exceed FMSY point value, as required by Article 4(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/472.\n(11)\nMeasures for recreational fisheries for European seabass should also be continued, taking account of the significant impact of such fisheries on the stocks concerned. Within the limits of the scientific advice, the catch-and-release practice and the bag limits should be continued. Considering the lack of sufficient selectivity and that higher number of specimens are likely to be caught than the established limits, fixed nets should be excluded. When only the catch-and-release practice is allowed, only the gear ensuring high survival rates should be permitted. Having considered environmental, social and economic circumstances, and especially the dependency of commercial fishermen on those stocks in coastal communities, those measures on European seabass would strike an appropriate balance between the interests of commercial and recreational fishermen. In particular, those measures would allow recreational fishermen to exercise their fishing activities by taking into account their impact on those stocks.\n(12)\nAs regards the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock, ICES has advised that all anthropogenic mortalities, including recreational and commercial fisheries, should be reduced to zero, or kept as close to zero as possible. Moreover, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted Recommendation GFCM/42/2018/1 establishing management measures for European eel in the Mediterranean. It is appropriate to maintain the level-playing field across the Union and hence to maintain also for the Union waters of the ICES area as well as brackish waters such as estuaries, coastal lagoons and transitional waters a consecutive three-month closure period for all fisheries of European eel at all life stages. As the fishing closure period should be consistent with the conservation objectives set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 (3) and with the temporal migration patterns of European eel, for the Union waters of the ICES area it is appropriate to set it in the period between 1 August 2020 and 28 February 2021.\n(13)\nFor some years, certain TACs for stocks of elasmobranchs (skates, sharks, rays) have been set at zero, with a linked provision establishing an obligation to immediately release accidental catches. The reason for that specific treatment was the poor conservation status of those stocks and the assumption that discarding, because of high survival rates, would not raise fishing mortality rates and would be beneficial for the conservation of those species. As of 1 January 2019, however, catches of those species have to be landed, unless they are covered by any of the derogations from the landing obligation provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Point (a) of Article 15(4) of that Regulation allows such derogations for species in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the CFP. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit fishing of those species in the areas concerned.\n(14)\nPursuant to Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, for stocks subject to specific multiannual plans the TACs should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in those plans.\n(15)\nThe North Sea multiannual plan was established by Regulation (EU) 2018/973 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and entered into force in 2018. The Western Waters multiannual plan entered into force in 2019. Fishing opportunities for stocks listed in Article 1 of those plans should be established in accordance with targets (ranges of FMSY) and safeguards in compliance with conditions provided for in those plans. The ranges of FMSY have been identified in the relevant ICES advice. Where no adequate scientific information is available, fishing opportunities for by-catch stocks should be established in accordance with the precautionary approach, as set out in the multiannual plans. In order to limit variations in fishing opportunities between consecutive years, in accordance with point (c) of Article 4(5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/472, it is appropriate to use the upper range of FMSY for the stocks of northern hake and southern hake.\n(16)\nIn accordance with Article 8 of the Western Waters multiannual plan, where scientific advice indicates that the spawning stock biomass of any of the stocks referred to in Article 1(1) of that plan is below the Blim, further remedial measures must be taken to ensure rapid return of the stock to levels above the level capable of producing MSY. In particular, those remedial measures may include suspending the targeted fishery for the stock concerned and the adequate reduction of fishing opportunities for those stocks and/or other stocks in the fisheries having by-catches of cod or whiting.\n(17)\nIn its advice, ICES indicated that stocks of cod and whiting in the Celtic Sea are below Blim. Therefore, further remedial measures should be taken for those stocks. Those measures should contribute to the recovery of the stocks concerned and should replace further reduction of fishing opportunities for fisheries in which those stocks are caught. As regards whiting in the Celtic Sea, those measures should consist of technical modifications to characteristics of gear to decrease by-catches of whiting, which are functionally linked to fishing opportunities for fisheries in which those species are being caught.\n(18)\nRemedial measures have been taken in 2019 fishing opportunities in respect of the Celtic Sea cod. On that occasion, the TAC for this stock was reserved for by-catches only. However, since the stock is under Blim, further remedial measures should be taken in order to bring the stock above the level capable of producing MSY, in accordance with Article 8(2) of the Western Waters multiannual plan. Such measures would improve selectivity by making the usage of gear that have lower levels of by-catches of cod mandatory in the areas where cod catches are significant, thus decreasing the fishing mortality of this stock in mixed fisheries. The level of the TAC should be established to avoid premature closure of the fishery in early 2020. In addition, the TAC should be such as to avoid potential discarding, which could undermine data collection and scientific assessment of the stock. Establishing the TAC at 805 tonnes would ensure a considerable increase in the stock spawning biomass in 2020 of at least 100 %, in order to ensure rapid return of the stock to levels capable of producing MSY (Btrigger).\n(19)\nThe TACs for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2016/1627 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).\n(20)\nAs a result of a benchmark exercise on the stock of herring to the west of Scotland, ICES has provided advice for the combined herring stocks in divisions 6a, 7b and 7c (West of Scotland, West of Ireland). The advice covers two separate TACs (for divisions 6aS, 7b and 7c on the one hand, and for divisions 5b, 6b and 6aN on the other). According to ICES, a rebuilding plan has to be developed for those stocks. Therefore, a TAC should be established to permit limited catches in the framework of a commercially operated scientific sampling programme.\n(21)\nAccording to scientific advice by ICES, the Celtic Sea herring (Clupea harengus) stock (in ICES divisions 7a South of 52° 30' N, 7g–h, and 7j–k) is below Blim. Therefore, ICES advised that catches in 2020 should be zero tonnes. ICES suggested that a monitoring fishery should be conducted to maximise the contribution to scientific data collection, including assisting with the acoustic survey and that the minimum level of catches should be 869 tonnes. This figure could provide the minimum number of at least 17 samples required for a TAC monitoring. It is thus appropriate to set a TAC for a sentinel fishery for Celtic Sea herring to collect uninterrupted fisheries-dependent catch data, without impairing the recovery of the stock.\n(22)\nOn 17 December 2018 ICES has published scientific advice on the inter-area flexibility for horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.) between ICES divisions 8c and 9a. ICES advised the inter-area flexibility between those two stocks should not exceed the difference between the catch corresponding to a fishing mortality of Fp.05 and the established TAC. There should also be no transfer of TAC to a stock with a spawning-stock biomass below the limit reference point (Blim). Under the conditions of that scientific advice, the inter-area flexibility (special condition) for horse mackerel between ICES subarea 9 and ICES division 8c for 2020 should be established at 10 %.\n(23)\nFor stocks for which there is no sufficient or reliable data in order to provide size estimates, management measures and TAC levels should follow the precautionary approach to fisheries management as defined in point (8) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, while taking into account stock-specific factors, including, in particular, available information on stock trends and mixed fisheries considerations.\n(24)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (6) introduced additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs including, under Articles 3 and 4 of that Regulation, flexibility provisions for precautionary and analytical TACs. Under Article 2 of that Regulation, when establishing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Article 3 or 4 of that Regulation is not to apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. In 2014, a further year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the CFP and deteriorate the biological status of the stocks, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.\n(25)\nThe inter-annual flexibility under Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 should be excluded where the application of this flexibility would undermine the achievement of the CFP objectives, in particular for stocks with spawning biomass below Blim.\n(26)\nMoreover, given that the biomass of the stocks of COD/03AS; COD/5BE6A; WHG/56-14; WHG/07A and PLE/7HJK is below Blim and that only by-catch and scientific fisheries are permitted in 2020, Member States have undertaken not to apply Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for those stocks in 2020 so that catches in 2020 would not exceed the established TACs.\n(27)\nWhere a TAC relating to a stock is allocated to one Member State only, it is appropriate to empower that Member State, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty, to determine the level of such TAC. Provisions should be made to ensure that, when fixing that TAC level, the Member State concerned acts in a manner fully consistent with the principles and rules of the CFP.\n(28)\nIt is necessary to establish the fishing effort ceilings for 2020 in accordance with Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 of, and Annex I to, Regulation (EU) 2016/1627.\n(29)\nIn order to guarantee full use of fishing opportunities, it is appropriate to allow for the implementation of a flexible arrangement between certain TAC areas where the same biological stock is concerned.\n(30)\nFor certain species, such as certain species of sharks, even a limited fishing activity could result in a serious conservation risk. Fishing opportunities for such species should therefore be fully restricted through a general prohibition on fishing those species.\n(31)\nAt the 12th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, held in Manila from 23 to 28 October 2017, a number of species were added to the lists of protected species in Appendices I and II to that Convention. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the protection of those species with respect to Union fishing vessels fishing in all waters and non-Union fishing vessels fishing in Union waters.\n(32)\nThe use of fishing opportunities available to Union fishing vessels set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (7), and in particular to Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation, concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by Member States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.\n(33)\nIt is appropriate, following advice from ICES, to maintain a specific system to manage sandeel and associated by-catches in Union waters of ICES divisions 2a and 3a and ICES subarea 4. Given that the ICES scientific advice is expected to become available only in February 2020, it is appropriate to set the TAC and quotas for that stock provisionally at zero until such advice is released.\n(34)\nIn accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway (8) and the Faroe Islands (9), the Union has held consultations on fishing rights with those partners. In accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreement and protocol on fisheries relations with Greenland (10), the Joint Committee has established the level of fishing opportunities available for the Union in Greenland waters in 2020. It is therefore necessary to include those fishing opportunities in this Regulation.\n(35)\nThe Union TAC for Greenland Halibut in international waters of 1 and 2 is without prejudice to the Union’s position on the appropriate Union share in this fishery.\n(36)\nAt its annual meeting in 2019, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) was unable to adopt conservation measures for the two redfish stocks in the Irminger Sea. The relevant TACs should be established for those stocks, in line with the positions expressed by the Union in NEAFC.\n(37)\nAt its annual meeting in 2017, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) agreed that in 2018 and 2019, the ICCAT may distribute the unallocated reserves for bluefin tuna for 2019 and 2020, considering in particular the needs of coastal developing ICCAT contracting parties and cooperating non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities (CPCs) in their artisanal fisheries. That distribution was agreed at the inter-sessional meeting of Panel 2 of ICCAT (Madrid, March 2018) based, for the Union allocation, on the information received from three Member States: Greece, Spain and Portugal. As a result, the Union received specific additional fishing opportunities of 87 tonnes for 2019 and 100 tonnes for 2020 to be used by the Union artisanal fleets in certain Union regions. That allocation of fishing opportunities to the Union was endorsed by ICCAT at its annual meetings in 2018 and 2019. The parameters established by the Council for establishing an allocation key for 2019 between Greece, Spain and Portugal remain valid for 2020.\n(38)\nThe ICCAT Recommendation 16-05, decreasing for 2020 the TAC for Mediterranean swordfish, should be implemented in Union law. As it is already the case for the stock of bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, it is appropriate that catches in recreational fisheries of all other ICCAT stocks should be subject to the catch limits as adopted by the ICCAT.\n(39)\nAt its annual meeting in 2019, ICCAT agreed for the first time on a TAC for the North Atlantic blue shark caught in association with ICCAT fisheries, and on the allocation key. The fishing opportunities for that stock should thus be allocated to the Member States. In addition, ICCAT agreed on an unallocated TAC for Southern Atlantic blue shark caught in association with ICCAT fisheries. Moreover, annual landing limits were allocated among Contracting Parties for the stocks of blue marlin and white marlin/spearfish in the Atlantic Ocean. Those measures should be implemented in Union law.\n(40)\nAt its annual meeting in 2019, the Parties to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopted catch limits for both target and by-catch species for the period from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020. The uptake of the quotas during 2019 should be considered when setting fishing opportunities for 2020.\n(41)\nAt its annual meeting in 2019, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted new catch limits for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) that do not affect the Union catch limits in the framework of IOTC. However, it reduced possibilities for using fish aggregating devices (FADs) and supply vessels. Measures on the retention of Mobulid rays were adopted. Those measures should be implemented in Union law.\n(42)\nThe annual meeting of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) will be held from 14 to 18 February 2020. The current measures in the SPRFMO Convention Area should be provisionally maintained until such annual meeting is held.\n(43)\nAt its annual meeting in 2017, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) adopted a conservation measure for yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna for the period 2018–2020. It was not revised at its annual meeting in 2019 and should thus continue being implemented in Union law.\n(44)\nAt its annual meeting in 2019, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) confirmed the TAC for the southern bluefin tuna for the period 2018–2020 adopted at the annual meeting in 2016. Those measures should be implemented in Union law.\n(45)\nAt its annual meeting in 2019, the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) adopted TACs for the main species under its purview. Those measures should be implemented in Union law.\n(46)\nAt its annual meeting in 2019, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) kept the previously adopted conservation and management measures. Those measures should continue being implemented in Union law.\n(47)\nAt its 41st annual meeting in 2019, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) adopted a number of fishing opportunities for 2020 for certain stocks in subareas 1 to 4 of the NAFO Convention Area. Those measures should be implemented in the Union law.\n(48)\nThe 6th Meeting of the Parties of the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) in 2019 adopted conservation and management measures for the stocks under the scope of the Agreement. Those measures should be implemented in Union law.\n(49)\nAs regards the fishing opportunities for snow crab around the area of Svalbard, the Treaty of Paris of 1920 grants equal and non-discriminatory access to resources for all parties to that Treaty, including with respect to fishing. The view of the Union concerning that access, as regards fishing for snow crab on the continental shelf around Svalbard, has been set out in two notes verbales to Norway dated 25 October 2016 and 24 February 2017. In order to ensure that the exploitation of snow crab within the area of Svalbard is made consistent with such non-discriminatory management rules as may be set out by Norway, which enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction in the area within the limits of the said Treaty, it is appropriate to fix the number of vessels that are authorised to conduct such fishery. The allocation of such fishing opportunities among Member States is limited to 2020. It is recalled that in the Union primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with applicable law lies with the flag Member States.\n(50)\nIn accordance with the declaration by the Union addressed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (11), it is necessary to fix the fishing opportunities for snapper available to Venezuela in Union waters.\n(51)\nGiven that certain provisions are to be applied on a continuous basis, and in order to avoid legal uncertainty during the period between the end of 2020 and the date of entry into force of the Regulation fixing the fishing opportunities for 2021, the provisions concerning prohibitions and closed seasons set out in this Regulation should continue to apply at the beginning of 2021, until the entry into force of the Regulation fixing the fishing opportunities for 2021.\n(52)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards authorising individual Member States to manage fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt-day system. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(53)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards granting of additional days at sea for permanent cessation of fishing activities and for enhanced scientific observer coverage as well as establishing formats of spreadsheets for the collection and transmission of information concerning transfer of days at sea between fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(54)\nIn order to avoid the interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the fishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2020, except for the provisions concerning fishing effort limits, which should apply from 1 February 2020, and certain provisions concerning particular regions, which should have a specific date of application. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication.\n(55)\nCertain international measures which create or restrict fishing opportunities for the Union are adopted by the relevant regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) at the end of the year and become applicable before the entry into force of this Regulation. It is therefore necessary for the provisions that implement such measures in Union law to apply retroactively. In particular, since the fishing season in the CCAMLR Convention Area runs from 1 December to 30 November, and thus certain fishing opportunities or prohibitions in the CCAMLR Convention Area are laid down for a period of time starting from 1 December 2019, it is appropriate that the relevant provisions of this Regulation apply from that date. Such retroactive application does not prejudice the principle of legitimate expectations as CCAMLR members are forbidden to fish in the CCAMLR Convention Area without authorisation.\n(56)\nFishing opportunities should be used in full compliance with Union law,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.

VESSELS\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 5\nTACs and allocations\n1.   The TACs for Union fishing vessels in Union waters or in certain non-Union waters and the allocation of such TACs among Member States, and the conditions functionally linked thereto, where appropriate, are set out in Annex I.\n2.   Union fishing vessels shall be authorised to fish, within the TACs set out in Annex I to this Regulation, in waters falling within the fisheries jurisdiction of the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Norway, and the fishing zone around Jan Mayen, subject to the condition set out in Article 18 of, and Part A of Annex V to, this Regulation and in Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25) and its implementing provisions.\nArticle 6\nTACs to be determined by Member States\n1.   The TACs for certain fish stocks shall be determined by the Member State concerned. Those stocks are identified in Annex I.\n2.   The TACs to be determined by a Member State shall:\n(a)\nbe consistent with the principles and rules of the CFP, in particular the principle of sustainable exploitation of the stock; and\n(b)\nresult:\n(i)\nif an analytical assessment is available, in the exploitation of the stock in line with MSY from 2020 onwards, with as high a probability as possible, or\n(ii)\nif an analytical assessment is unavailable or incomplete, in the exploitation of the stock consistent with the precautionary approach to fisheries management.\n3.   By 15 March 2020, each Member State concerned shall submit the following information to the Commission:\n(a)\nthe TACs adopted;\n(b)\nthe data collected and assessed by the Member State concerned on which the TACs adopted are based;\n(c)\ndetails on how the TACs adopted comply with paragraph 2.\nArticle 7\nConditions for landing catches and by-catches\n1.   Catches that are not subject to the landing obligation under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 shall be retained on board or landed only if they:\n(a)\nhave been taken by vessels flying the flag of a Member State having a quota and that quota has not been exhausted, or\n(b)\nconsist of a share in a Union quota which has not been allocated by quota among Member States, and that Union quota has not been exhausted.\n2.   The stocks of non-target species within safe biological limits referred to in Article 15(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 are identified in Annex I to this Regulation for the purposes of the derogation from the obligation to count catches against the relevant quotas provided for in that Article.\nArticle 8\nQuota-exchange mechanism for TACs for unavoidable by-catches with regard to the landing obligation\n1.   In order to take into account the introduction of the landing obligation and to make quotas for certain by-catches available to Member States without a quota, the quota-exchange mechanism set out in paragraphs 2–5 of this Article shall apply to the TACs identified in Annex IA.\n2.   6 % of each quota from the TACs for cod in the Celtic Sea, cod in the West of Scotland, whiting in the Irish Sea and plaice in ICES divisions 7h, 7j and 7k, and 3 % of each quota from the TAC for West of Scotland whiting, allocated to each Member State, shall be made available for a pool for quota exchanges, which shall open as of 1 January 2020. Member States without quota shall have exclusive access to the quota pool until 31 March 2020.\n3.   The quantities drawn from the pool may not be exchanged or transferred to the following year. Any unused quantities shall be returned, after 31 March 2020, to those Member States that have initially contributed to the pool for quota exchanges.\n4.   The quotas provided in return shall be preferably taken from a list of TACs identified by each Member State contributing to the pool as listed in the Appendix to Annex IA.\n5.   Those quotas shall be of equivalent commercial value by using a market exchange rate or other mutually acceptable exchange rates. In absence of alternatives, the equivalent economic value in accordance to the average Union prices of the previous year, as provided by the European Market Observatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture Products, shall be used.\n6.   In cases where the quota-exchange mechanism set out in paragraphs 2–5 of this Article does not allow Member States to cover their unavoidable by-catches to a similar extent, Member States shall endeavour to agree on quota exchanges pursuant to Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, ensuring that quotas exchanged are of equivalent commercial value.\nArticle 9\nFishing effort limits in ICES division 7e\n1.   For the periods referred to in point (b) of Article 1(2), the technical aspects of the rights and obligations related to Annex II for the management of the sole stock in ICES division 7e are set out in Annex II.\n2.   The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate a requesting Member State a number of days at sea additional to those referred to in point 5 of Annex II, on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within ICES division 7e when carrying on board any regulated gear, on the basis of such a request by that Member State, in accordance with point 7.4 of Annex II. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 53(2).\n3.   The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate a requesting Member State a maximum of three days between 1 February 2020 and 31 January 2021 additional to those referred to in point 5 of Annex II, on which a vessel may be present within ICES division 7e on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage as referred to in point 8.1 of Annex II. Such an allocation shall be done on the basis of the description submitted by the Member State in accordance with point 8.3 of Annex II and following consultation with the STECF. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 53(2).\nArticle 10\nMeasures on European seabass fisheries\n1.   It shall be prohibited for Union fishing vessels, as well as for any commercial fisheries from shore, to fish for European seabass in ICES divisions 4b and 4c, and in ICES subarea 7. It shall be prohibited to retain, tranship, relocate or land European seabass caught in that area.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, in January 2020 and from 1 April to 31 December 2020, Union fishing vessels in ICES divisions 4b, 4c, 7d, 7e, 7f and 7h and in waters within 12 nautical miles from baselines under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom in ICES divisions 7a and 7g may fish for European seabass, and retain, tranship, relocate or land European seabass caught in that area with the following gear and within the following limits:\n(a)\nusing demersal trawls (26), for unavoidable by-catches not exceeding 520 kilogrammes per two months and 5 % of the weight of the total catches of marine organisms on board caught by that vessel per fishing trip;\n(b)\nusing seines (27), for unavoidable by-catches not exceeding 520 kilogrammes per two months and 5 % of the weight of the total catches of marine organisms on board caught by that vessel per fishing trip;\n(c)\nusing hooks and lines (28), not exceeding 5,7 tonnes per vessel per year;\n(d)\nusing fixed gillnets (29), for unavoidable by-catches not exceeding 1,4 tonnes per vessel per year.\nThe derogations set out in the first subparagraph shall apply to Union fishing vessels that have recorded catches of European seabass over the period from 1 July 2015 to 30 September 2016: in point (c) with recorded catches using hooks and lines, and in point (d) with recorded catches using fixed gillnets. In the case of a replacement of a Union fishing vessel, Member States may allow the derogation to apply to another fishing vessel provided that the number of Union fishing vessels subject to the derogation and their overall fishing capacity do not increase.\n3.   The catch limits set out in paragraph 2 shall not be transferable between vessels and, where a monthly limit applies, from one month to another. For Union fishing vessels using more than one gear in a single calendar month, the lowest catch limit set out in paragraph 2 for either gear shall apply.\nMember States shall report to the Commission all catches of European seabass per type of gear no later than 15 days after the end of each month.\n4.   France and Spain shall ensure that fishing mortality of seabass stock in ICES divisions 8a and 8b from their commercial and recreational fisheries do not exceed the FMSY point value resulting in 2 533 tonnes of total catches, as required by Article 4(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/472.\n5.   In recreational fisheries, including from shore, in ICES divisions 4b, 4c, 6a, 7a to 7k:\n(a)\nfrom 1 January to 29 February and from 1 to 31 December 2020, only catch-and-release fishing with a rod or a handline for European seabass shall be allowed. During those periods, it shall be prohibited to retain, relocate, tranship or land European seabass caught in that area;\n(b)\nfrom 1 March to 30 November 2020, not more than two specimens of European seabass may be caught and retained per fisherman per day; the minimum size of European seabass retained shall be 42 cm.\nPoint (b) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to fixed nets, which may not be used to catch or retain European seabass during the period referred to in that point.\n6.   In recreational fisheries in ICES divisions 8a and 8b, a maximum of two specimens of European seabass may be caught and retained per fisherman per day. The minimum size of European seabass retained shall be 42 cm. This paragraph shall not apply to fixed nets, which may not be used to catch or retain European seabass.\n7.   Paragraphs 5 and 6 shall be without prejudice to more stringent national measures on recreational fisheries.\nArticle 11\nMeasures on European eel fisheries in Union waters of the ICES area\nAny targeted, incidental and recreational fishery of European eel shall be prohibited in Union waters of the ICES area and brackish waters such as estuaries, coastal lagoons and transitional waters for a consecutive three-month period to be determined by each Member State concerned between 1 August 2020 and 28 February 2021. Member States shall communicate the determined period to the Commission no later than 1 June 2020.\nArticle 12\nSpecial provisions on allocations of fishing opportunities\n1.

SCOPE\n1.1.\nThis Annex shall apply to Union fishing vessels of 10 metres length overall or more carrying on board or deploying beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm and static nets, including gillnets, trammel-nets and tangle-nets, with mesh size equal to or less than 220 mm in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 509/2007, and present in ICES division 7e.\n1.2.\nVessels fishing with static nets with mesh size equal to or larger than 120 mm and with track records of less than 300 kg live weight of sole per year during the three previous years, according to their fishing records, shall be exempt from the application of this Annex subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nsuch vessels caught less than 300 kg live weight of sole during the 2018 management period;\n(b)\nsuch vessels do not tranship any fish at sea to another vessel;\n(c)\nby 31 July 2020 and 31 January 2021 each Member State concerned makes a report to the Commission on those vessels' catch records for sole in the three previous years as well as on catches of sole in 2020.\nWhere any of those conditions is not met, the vessels concerned shall cease to be exempt from the application of this Annex, with immediate effect.\n2.   DEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘gear grouping’ means the grouping consisting of the following two gear categories:\n(i)\nbeam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm, and\n(ii)\nstatic nets, including gillnets, trammel nets and tangle-nets, with mesh size equal to or less than 220 mm;\n(b)\n‘regulated gear’ means any of the two gear categories belonging to the gear grouping;\n(c)\n‘area’ means ICES division 7e;\n(d)\n‘current management period’ means the period from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021.\n3.   LIMITATION IN ACTIVITY\nWithout prejudice to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, each Member State shall ensure that, when carrying on board any regulated gear, Union fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Union shall be present within the area for no more than the number of days set out in Chapter III of this Annex.\nCHAPTER II\nAuthorisations\n4.   AUTHORISED VESSELS\n4.1\nA Member State shall not authorise fishing with regulated gear in the area by any vessel flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity in the area in the period from 2002 to 2018, excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the area.\n4.2\nHowever, a vessel with a track record of using a regulated gear may be authorised to use a different fishing gear, provided that the number of days allocated to this latter gear is greater than or equal to the number of days allocated to the regulated gear.\n4.3\nA vessel flying the flag of a Member State having no quotas in the area shall not be authorised to fish in the area with regulated gear, unless the vessel is allocated a quota after a transfer as permitted in accordance with Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and is allocated days at sea in accordance with point 10 or 11 of this Annex.\nCHAPTER III\nNumber of days present within the area allocated to Union fishing vessels\n5.   MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS\nDuring the current management period, the maximum number of days at sea for which a Member State may authorise a vessel flying its flag to be present within the area carrying on board any regulated gear is shown in Table I.\nTable I\nMaximum number of days a vessel may be present within the area by category of regulated gear per year\nRegulated gear\nMaximum number of days\nBeam trawls of mesh size ≥ 80 mm\nBelgium\n176\nFrance\n188\nUnited Kingdom\n222\nStatic nets with mesh size ≤ 220 mm\nBelgium\n176\nFrance\n191\nUnited Kingdom\n176\n6.   KILOWATT DAY SYSTEM\n6.1.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may manage its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system. Through that system it may authorise any vessel concerned by any regulated gear as set out in Table I to be present within the area for a maximum number of days which is different from that set out in that Table, provided that the overall amount of kilowatt days corresponding to the regulated gear is respected.\n6.2.\nThis overall amount of kilowatt days shall be the sum of all individual fishing efforts allocated to the vessels flying the flag of that Member State and qualified for the regulated gear. Such individual fishing efforts shall be calculated in kilowatt days by multiplying the engine power of each vessel by the number of days at sea it would benefit from, according to Table I, if point 6.1 were not applied.\n6.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the system referred to in point 6.1 shall submit a request to the Commission, for the regulated gear as laid down in Table I, with reports in electronic format containing the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nthe list of vessels authorised to fish by indicating their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe number of days at sea for which each vessel would have initially been authorised to fish according to Table I and the number of days at sea which each vessel would benefit from in application of point 6.1.\n6.4.\nOn the basis of that request, the Commission shall assess whether the conditions referred to in point 6 are complied with and, where applicable, may authorise that Member State to benefit from the system referred to in point 6.1.\n7.   ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR PERMANENT CESSATION OF FISHING ACTIVITIES\n7.1.\nAn additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place during the preceding management period either in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 or with Regulation (EC) No 744/2008. Permanent cessations resulting from any other circumstances may be considered by the Commission on a case-by-case basis, following a written and duly motivated request from the Member State concerned. Such written request shall identify the vessels concerned and confirm, for each of them, that they shall never return to fishing activities.\n7.2.\nThe effort expended in 2003 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using a given gear grouping shall be divided by the effort expended by all vessels using that gear grouping during 2003. The additional number of days at sea shall be then calculated by multiplying the ratio so obtained by the number of days that would have been allocated according to Table I. Any part of a day resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.\n7.3.\nPoints 7.1 and 7.2 shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point 4.2, or when the withdrawal has already been used in previous years to obtain additional days at sea.\n7.4.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 7.1 shall submit a request to the Commission, by 15 June of the current management period, with reports in electronic format containing for the gear grouping as laid down in Table I, the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nlists of withdrawn vessels with their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe fishing activity deployed by such vessels in 2003 calculated in days at sea according to the grouping of fishing gear.\n7.5.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may re-allocate any additionally granted days at sea to all or part of the vessels remaining in fleet and qualified for the regulated gear.\n7.6.\nWhen the Commission allocates additional days at sea due to a permanent cessation of fishing activities during the preceding management period the maximum number of days per Member State and gear shown in Table I shall be adjusted accordingly for the current management period.\n8.   ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR ENHANCED SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER COVERAGE\n8.1.\nThree additional days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated between 1 February 2020 and 31 January 2021 to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage in partnership between scientists and the fishing industry. Such a programme shall focus in particular on levels of discarding and on catch composition and go beyond the requirements on data collection, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 and its implementing rules for national programmes.\n8.2.\nScientific observers shall be independent from the owner, the master of the fishing vessel and any crew member.\n8.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 8.1 shall submit a description of its enhanced scientific observer coverage programme to the Commission for approval.\n8.4.\nIf an enhanced scientific observer coverage programme submitted by a Member State has been approved by the Commission in the past and the Member State concerned wishes to continue its application without changes, it shall inform the Commission of the continuation of that programme four weeks before the beginning of the period for which the programme applies.\nCHAPTER IV\nManagement\n9.   GENERAL OBLIGATION\nMember States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with Articles 26 to 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n10.   MANAGEMENT PERIODS\n10.1.\nA Member State may divide the days present within the area set out in Table I into management periods of durations of one or more calendar months.\n10.2.\nThe number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed by the Member State concerned.\n10.3.\nWhere a Member State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within the area by hours, the Member State shall continue measuring the consumption of days as specified in point 9. Upon request by the Commission, the Member State shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of days within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a 24-hour period.\nCHAPTER V\nExchanges of fishing effort allocations\n11.   TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF A MEMBER STATE\n11.1.\nA Member State may permit any fishing vessel flying its flag to transfer days present within the area for which it has been authorised to another vessel flying its flag within the area, provided that the product of the number of days received by a vessel and its engine power in kilowatts (kilowatt days) is equal to or less than the product of the number of days transferred by the donor vessel and its engine power in kilowatts. The engine power in kilowatts of the vessels shall be that recorded for each vessel in the Union fishing fleet register.\n11.2.\nThe total number of days present within the area transferred in accordance with point 11.1, multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of the donor vessel, shall not be higher than the donor vessel's average annual days track record in the area as verified by the fishing logbook in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel.\n11.3.\nThe transfer of days in accordance with point 11.1 shall be permitted between vessels operating with any regulated gear and during the same management period.\n11.4.\nOn request from the Commission, Member States shall provide information on the transfers that have taken place. Formats of spreadsheet for the collection and transmission of that information may be established by the Commission, by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 53(2).\n12.   TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES\nMember States may permit transfer of days present within the area for the same management period and within the area between any fishing vessels flying their flags provided that points 4.2, 4.4, 5, 6 and 10 apply mutatis mutandis. Where Member States decide to authorise such a transfer, they shall notify, before the transfer takes place, the Commission of the details of the transfer, including the number of days to be transferred, the fishing effort and, where applicable, the fishing quotas relating thereto.\nCHAPTER VI\nReporting obligations\n13.   FISHING EFFORT REPORT\nArticle 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 shall apply to vessels falling under the scope of this Annex. The geographical area referred to in that Article shall be understood as the area specified in point 2 of this Annex.\n14.   COLLECTION OF RELEVANT DATA\nMember States shall collect on a quarterly basis the information about total fishing effort deployed within the area for towed gear and static gear, effort deployed by vessels using different types of gear in the area, and the engine power of those vessels in kilowatt days, on the basis of information used for the management of fishing days present within the area as set out in this Annex.\n15.   COMMUNICATION OF RELEVANT DATA\nUpon request from the Commission, Member States shall make available to the Commission a spreadsheet with data specified in point 14 in the format specified in Tables II and III by sending it to the appropriate electronic mailbox address, which shall be communicated to the Member States by the Commission. Member States shall, upon the Commission's request, send detailed information to the Commission on effort allocated and consumed covering all or parts of the 2018 and 2019 management periods, using the data format specified in Tables IV and V.\nTable II\nReporting format kW-day information by management period\nMember State\nGear\nManagement period\nCumulative effort declaration\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nTable III\nData format kW-day information by management period\nName of field\nMaximum number of characters/digits\nAlignment (1) L(eft)/R(ight)\nDefinition and comments\n(1)\nMember State\n3\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) in which the vessel is registered\n(2)\nGear\n2\nOne of the following gear types:\nBT = beam trawls ≥ 80 mm\nGN = gillnet < 220 mm\nTN = trammel net or entangling net < 220 mm\n(3)\nManagement period\n4\nOne year in the period from the 2006 management period to the current management period\n(4)\nCumulative effort declaration\n7\nR\nCumulative amount of fishing effort expressed in kilowatt days deployed from 1 February until 31 January of the relevant management period\nTable IV\nReporting format for vessel-related information\nMember State\nCFR\nExternal marking\nLength of management period\nGear notified\nDays eligible using notified gear(s)\nDays spent with notified gear(s)\nTransfer of days\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(5)\n(5)\n(5)\n(6)\n(6)\n(6)\n(6)\n(7)\n(7)\n(7)\n(7)\n(8)\nTable V\nData format for vessel-related information\nName of field\nMaximum number of characters/digits\nAlignment (2) L(eft)/R(ight)\nDefinition and comments\n(1)\nMember State\n3\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) in which vessel is registered\n(2)\nCFR\n12\nUnion fishing fleet register number (CFR)\nUnique identification number of a fishing vessel\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) followed by an identifying series (9 characters).

The limits generally apply for the 2020 calendar year, but some extend into 2021 or apply for slightly different periods. The regulation includes rules on:\nTACs and allocations among EU countries;\nConditions for landing catches and by-catches, including which species may be retained on board or landed, aiming to continue to reduce unwanted catches through the landing obligation (i.e. the prohibition to discard certain stocks at sea) for all stocks under catch limit;\nQuota-exchange mechanism for TACs for unavoidable by-catches*;\nSlightly increased by-catch levels for seabass in the Northern areas and additional flexibility in their management;\nMeasures on European eel fisheries in EU waters;\nSpecial provisions on allocations of fishing opportunities to EU countries, such as exchanges and quota transfers;\nRemedial measures for cod and whiting in the Celtic Sea, North Sea and Kattegat, with the aim of improving the selectivity of fishing gears and reducing by-catches;\nProhibited species;\nClosed fishing seasons;\nRecreational fisheries;\nSharks: retaining on board, transshipping* or landing is generally prohibited, and if caught accidentally must be promptly released.\nThe regulation also covers\nFishing authorisations in non-EU waters;\nFishing opportunities for non-EU vessels in EU waters.\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2236 fixes for 2020 the fishing opportunities in the Mediterranean and Black Seas for the following fish stocks.The rules include:\nA fishing effort regime in the Western Mediterranean applying to Spain, France and Italy;\nA closure period for European eel in the entire Mediterranean Sea;\nCatch and effort limits for small pelagic stocks and an effort limit for demersal stocks in the Adriatic Sea;\nAn autonomous quota for sprat in the Black Sea applying to Bulgaria and Romania;\nA TAC for turbot in the Black Sea, as well as closure periods and a fishing effort regime.\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1838 fixes fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks in the Baltic Sea for 2020 and amends some fishing opportunities in other waters fixed by Regulation (EU) 2019/124. It covers:\nTACs and national quotas for the ten most commercially important fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and how much European fishermen will be able to fish and under what conditions;\nDecreased fishing opportunities for the majority of fish stocks;\nModerately increased TACs only for herring in the Gulf of Riga;\nTACs maintained for salmon in the Gulf of Finland;\nparticularly significant cuts for cod, with a 60% decrease in the Western part of the Baltic Sea, and a TAC for by-catches only in the Eastern part;\nAdditional remedial measures on cod stocks, including stricter limits for recreational fisheries (normally a bag limit of five specimens per fisherman per day) and longer closure periods in some geographical subdivisions.\nWHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\n              \nThey apply from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 with some minor exceptions.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nThe Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (European Commission)\nManagement of the EU’s fish stocks (Council of the European Union)\nManaging fisheries (European Commission)\nFishing quotas (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nTotal allowable catch (TAC): the quantity of each type of fish that can be caught over the period of a year.\nQuota: a proportion of the TAC allocated to the EU, an EU country or a non-EU country.\nRecreational fisheries: non-commercial fishing activities exploiting marine biological resources such as for recreation, tourism or sport.\nBy-catch: unwanted fish and marine species caught unintentionally.\nTransshipment: the transfer of a catch from a smaller fishing boat to a larger one which then incorporates it into a larger batch for shipment.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2020/123 of 27 January 2020 fixing for 2020 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters (OJ L 25, 30.1.2020, pp. 1-156)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2020/123 have been incorporated into the original text.
