{"celex_id": "32016L0798", "reference": "26.5.2016\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 138/102\nDIRECTIVE (EU) 2016/798 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 May 2016\non railway safety\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) has been substantially amended. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nDirective 2004/49/EC established a common regulatory framework for railway safety through harmonisation of the content of safety rules, the safety certification of railway undertakings, the tasks and roles of the national safety authorities and the investigation of accidents. Nevertheless, in order to pursue efforts to further develop a single European railway area, it is necessary to thoroughly revise Directive 2004/49/EC.\n(3)\nMetros, trams and other light rail systems are subject in many Member States to local technical requirements and are excluded from the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). In order to facilitate the implementation of this Directive and of Directive (EU) 2016/797, both Directives should have the same scope. Therefore, such local systems should be excluded from the scope of this Directive.\n(4)\nInsofar as some concepts referred to in this Directive may be usefully applied to metros and other local systems, Member States should be permitted to decide, without prejudice to the scope of this Directive, to apply certain provisions of this Directive that they consider to be appropriate. In such cases, Member States should be allowed not to apply obligations such as the notification of national rules and reporting.\n(5)\nSafety levels in the Union rail system are generally high especially when compared to road transport. Railway safety should be generally maintained and, when practicable, continuously improved, taking into account technical and scientific progress, and the development of Union and international law. Priority should be given to the prevention of accidents. The impact of human factors should also be taken into consideration.\n(6)\nIf a Member State introduces a higher level of safety, it should ensure that the rule adopted does not create a barrier to interoperability or result in discrimination.\n(7)\nThe main actors in the Union rail system, infrastructure managers and railway undertakings should bear full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part. Whenever appropriate, they should cooperate in implementing risk control measures.\n(8)\nWithout prejudice to the responsibility of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings for developing and improving railway safety, the other actors, such as entities in charge of maintenance, manufacturers, carriers, consignors, consignees, fillers, unfillers, loaders, unloaders, maintenance suppliers, keepers, service providers and contracting entities, should not be precluded from assuming responsibility for their products, services and processes. Each actor in the Union rail system should be responsible, vis-à-vis the other actors, for complete and truthful communication of all relevant information to check whether vehicles are fit to run. This concerns, in particular, information on the status and history of a given vehicle, maintenance files, traceability of loading operations, and consignment notes.\n(9)\nEach railway undertaking, infrastructure manager and entity in charge of maintenance should ensure that its contractors and other parties implement risk control measures. To that end, each railway undertaking, infrastructure manager and entity in charge of maintenance should apply the methods for monitoring set out in the common safety methods (‘CSMs’). Their contractors should apply this process through contractual arrangements. In view of the fact that such arrangements are an essential part of the safety management system of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers, railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should disclose their contractual arrangements on request of the European Union Agency for Railways (‘the Agency’) established by Regulation (EU) 2016/796 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) or the national safety authority in the context of supervision activities.\n(10)\nMember States should promote a culture of mutual trust, confidence and learning in which the staff of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers are encouraged to contribute to the development of safety while confidentiality is ensured.\n(11)\nCommon safety targets (‘CSTs’) and CSMs have been gradually introduced to ensure that safety is maintained at a high level and, when necessary and where reasonably practicable, improved. They should provide tools for the assessment of the safety and performance of operators at Union level as well as in the Member States. Common safety indicators (‘CSIs’) have been established in order to assess whether systems comply with the CSTs and to facilitate the monitoring of railway safety performance.\n(12)\nNational rules, which are often based on national technical standards, are being gradually replaced by rules based on common standards, established by CSTs, CSMs and technical specifications for interoperability (‘TSIs’). In order to eliminate the obstacles to interoperability, the volume of national rules, including operating rules, should be reduced as a consequence of extending the scope of the TSIs to the whole of the Union rail system and of closing open points in the TSIs. For that purpose, Member States should keep their system of national rules updated, delete obsolete rules and inform the Commission and the Agency thereof without delay.\n(13)\nNational rules should be drafted and published in such a way that any potential user of a national network can understand them. However, such rules often refer to other documents such as national standards, European standards, international standards or other technical specifications which might be partly or fully protected by intellectual property rights. It is appropriate, therefore, that the obligation of publication should not apply to any documents referred to directly or indirectly in the national rule.\n(14)\nNational rules often include requirements which are partly relevant for both interoperability and safety purposes. Safety being an essential requirement of Directive (EU) 2016/797, a national rule may be relevant for Directive (EU) 2016/797 and for this Directive. The distinction between the terms ‘national safety rules’ and ‘national technical rules’ as defined in Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) respectively should therefore be removed and replaced by the concept of ‘national rules’ which are to be notified under Directive (EU) 2016/797 and/or this Directive. National rules are to be notified under Directive (EU) 2016/797 mainly when they relate to the placing on the market or placing in service of structural subsystems. They should be notified under this Directive when they relate to the operation of the Union rail system, or to the specific subjects of this Directive, including the role of the actors, safety certification, safety authorisation and accident investigation.\n(15)\nIn view of the gradual approach to eliminating obstacles to the interoperability of the Union rail system and of the time consequently required for the adoption of TSIs, steps should be taken to avoid a situation where Member States adopt new national rules or undertake projects that increase the diversity of the present system except in the specific situations as provided for in this Directive. The safety management system is the recognised tool for controlling risks, whereas infrastructure managers and railway undertakings are responsible for taking immediate corrective action to prevent recurrence of accidents. Member States should avoid establishing new national rules immediately after an accident, unless such new rules are required as an urgent preventive measure.\n(16)\nTrain control and signalling systems play a critical role in ensuring railway safety. In this regard, the deployment of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) on the Union railway network constitutes an important contribution to improving safety levels.\n(17)\nIn carrying out their duties and fulfilling their responsibilities, infrastructure managers and railway undertakings should implement a safety management system meeting Union requirements and containing common elements. Information on safety and on the implementation of the safety management system should be submitted to the Agency and to the national safety authority in the Member State concerned.\n(18)\nThrough its processes, the safety management system should ensure that human capabilities and limitations and the influences on human performance are addressed by applying human factors knowledge and using recognised methods.\n(19)\nRail freight services should also encompass the transport of dangerous goods. However, a distinction should be made between the objective of this Directive, which is to maintain and, where possible, improve the safety of the Union rail system, and that of Directive 2008/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), which is, mainly, to regulate the classification of substances and the specification of their containments, including the safe loading, unloading and use of the containments within the existing railway system. Consequently, without prejudice to Directive 2008/68/EC, the safety management system of the railway undertakings and of the infrastructure managers should duly take into consideration the potential additional risks generated by carrying dangerous goods containments.\n(20)\nAll railway undertakings should be subject to the same safety requirements in order to ensure a high level of railway safety and equal conditions. A railway undertaking should hold a safety certificate as a condition of being allowed to obtain access to the railway infrastructure. The safety certificate should provide evidence that the railway undertaking has established its safety management system and that it is able to comply with the relevant safety standards and rules for the relevant area of operation. When the Agency issues a single safety certificate to a railway undertaking having an area of operation in one or more Member States, it should be the only authority to assess whether the railway undertaking has correctly established its safety management system. The national safety authorities concerned by the intended area of operation should be involved in assessing the requirements laid down in the relevant national rules.\n(21)\nHarmonised methods based on Directive 2004/49/EC have been established, to be applied to the actors in the Union rail system and the national safety authorities, on monitoring, conformity assessment, supervision and risk evaluation and assessment. That regulatory framework is sufficiently mature to move progressively towards a ‘single safety certificate’ valid within the area of operation of the railway undertaking concerned.\n(22)\nIn order to make the procedures for issuing single safety certificates to railway undertakings more efficient and coherent, it is necessary to assign the Agency a central role in the issuing of such certificates. Where the area of operation is limited to one Member State, the applicant should have the possibility of choosing whether to submit its application for a single safety certificate, through the one-stop shop referred to in Regulation (EU) 2016/796, to the national safety authority of that Member State or to the Agency. The choice made by the applicant should be binding until the application is completed or terminated. This new regime should make the Union rail system more effective and efficient by reducing administrative burdens for railway undertakings.\n(23)\nThe Agency and the national safety authorities should cooperate and share competences as appropriate for the issuing of single safety certificates. Clear procedural and arbitration provisions should be established to address situations where the Agency and the national safety authorities disagree on assessments made in relation to the issuing of single safety certificates.\n(24)\nThe new allocation of functions and tasks between national safety authorities and the Agency concerning the issuing of safety certificates should be done efficiently. To that end, cooperation agreements between the Agency and the national safety authorities should be established.\n(25)\nIn particular, cooperation agreements are required to take account of the specific geographical and historical situation of certain Member States, while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market. Where operation is limited to networks requiring specific expertise for geographical or historical reasons, and where such networks are isolated from the rest of the Union rail system, it should be possible for the applicant to fulfil the necessary formalities locally by interacting with the relevant national safety authorities. To that end, for the purposes of reducing administrative burdens and costs, it should be possible for the cooperation agreements to be concluded between the Agency and the relevant national safety authorities to provide for an appropriate allocation of tasks, without prejudice to the ultimate responsibility of the Agency in issuing the single safety certificate.\n(26)\nThe railway networks located in the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) have 1520 mm track gauge, which is the same as in neighbouring third countries, but different from that of the main rail network within the Union. These Baltic networks have inherited common technical and operational requirements which provide de facto interoperability between them, and, in this respect, the safety certificate issued in one of these Member States might be extended to the rest of these networks. To facilitate the efficient and proportionate allocation of resources for safety certification, and to reduce the financial and administrative burden for the applicant in such cases, the specific cooperation arrangements between the Agency and relevant national safety authorities should include, where necessary, the possibility of contracting tasks to these national safety authorities.\n(27)\nThis Directive should not lead to a reduced level of safety and should not increase costs in the Union's railway sector. To that end, the Agency and the national safety authorities should take full responsibility for the single safety certificates they issue, assuming in particular contractual and non-contractual liabilities in that regard. In the event of a judicial inquiry involving the Agency or its staff, the Agency should cooperate fully with the competent authorities of the Member State or States concerned.\n(28)\nA clear distinction should be drawn between, on the one hand, the immediate responsibility of the Agency and the national safety authorities for safety deriving from the issuing of the safety certificates and safety authorisations and, on the other, the national safety authorities' task of providing a national regulatory framework and supervising the performance of all parties concerned on a continuous basis. Each national safety authority should oversee continued compliance with the legal obligation imposed on a railway undertaking or infrastructure manager to establish a safety management system. Establishing evidence of such compliance may require not only on-site inspections of the railway undertaking or infrastructure manager concerned, but also supervision tasks to be carried out by the national safety authorities in order to assess that the railway undertaking or infrastructure manager continue to duly apply their safety management system after having been granted a safety certificate or a safety authorisation. National safety authorities should coordinate their supervision activities in relation to railway undertakings established in different Member States, and should share information among themselves and, where appropriate, with the Agency. The Agency should assist the national safety authorities in their cooperation. In that context, necessary arrangements should be established by the Agency and the national safety authorities to facilitate the exchange of information between them.\n(29)\nThe Agency and the national safety authorities should cooperate closely in cases where a national safety authority concludes that a holder of a single safety certificate issued by the Agency no longer satisfies the conditions for certification. In such a case, it should ask the Agency to restrict or revoke that certificate. An arbitration procedure should be established to deal with cases of disagreement between the Agency and the national safety authority. If a national safety authority identifies a serious safety risk during supervision, it should inform the Agency and any other national safety authority concerned in the area of operation of the railway undertaking. The national safety authorities concerned should be allowed to apply temporary safety measures, including immediately restricting or suspending the relevant operations. A serious safety risk in this context should be understood as being a serious instance of non-compliance with legal obligations or safety requirements that may in itself, or in a series of consequential events, cause an accident or a serious accident.\n(30)\nThe Agency should be able to establish a tool that facilitates the exchange of information among the relevant actors who identify or are informed of a safety risk relating to defects and construction non-conformities or malfunctions of technical equipment.\n(31)\nThe single safety certificate should be issued on the basis of evidence that a railway undertaking has established its safety management system.\n(32)\nInfrastructure managers should have a key responsibility for the safe design, maintenance and operation of their rail network. Infrastructure managers should be subject to a safety authorisation by the national safety authority concerning their safety management system and to other provisions so as to meet safety requirements.\n(33)\nThe certification of train staff might create difficulties for new entrants. Member States should ensure that facilities for the training and certification of train staff necessary to meet requirements under national rules are available to railway undertakings intending to operate on the relevant network.\n(34)\nThe entity in charge of maintenance should be certified for freight wagons. Where the entity in charge of maintenance is an infrastructure manager, this certification should be included in the procedure for safety authorisation. The certificate issued to such an entity should guarantee that the maintenance requirements of this Directive are met for any freight wagon for which it is responsible. That certificate should be valid throughout the Union and should be issued by a body able to audit the maintenance system established by the entity. As freight wagons are frequently used in international traffic, and as the entity in charge of maintenance may want to use workshops established in more than one Member State, the certification body should be able to implement its controls throughout the Union. The Agency should evaluate the system of certification of the entity in charge of maintenance for freight wagons and should, if appropriate, recommend its extension to all rail vehicles.\n(35)\nThe national safety authorities should be fully independent in their organisation, legal structure and decision-making from any railway undertaking, infrastructure manager, applicant, contracting entity or entity which awards public service contracts. They should carry out their tasks in an open and non-discriminatory way and should cooperate with the Agency to create a single European railway area and coordinate their decision-making criteria. It should be possible, where necessary, for Member States to decide to include their national safety authority within the national ministry responsible for transport matters, provided that the independence of the national safety authority is respected. In order to fulfil their tasks, the national safety authorities should have the necessary internal and external organisational capacity in terms of human and material resources.\n(36)\nThe national investigating bodies play a core role in the safety investigation process. Their work is of the utmost importance in determining the causes of an accident or incident. It is therefore essential that they should possess the financial and human resources required to conduct effective and efficient investigations. The national investigating bodies should cooperate with a view to exchanging information and best practices. They should establish a programme of peer reviews in order to monitor the effectiveness of their investigations. The peer-review reports should be provided to the Agency in order to allow it to monitor the overall safety performance of the Union rail system.\n(37)\nSerious accidents on the railways are rare. However, they can have disastrous consequences and raise concern among the public about the safety performance of the Union rail system. All such accidents should therefore be investigated from a safety perspective to avoid recurrence with the results of the investigations being made publicly available. Other accidents and incidents should also be subject to safety investigations when they involve significant precursors to a serious accident.\n(38)\nA safety investigation should be kept separate from any judicial inquiry into the same incident, and those conducting it should be granted access to evidence and witnesses. It should be carried out by a permanent body that is independent of the actors in the Union rail system. The body should function in a way which avoids any conflict of interest and any possible involvement in the causes of the occurrences that are investigated. In particular, its functional independence should not be affected if it is closely linked, for organisational and legal structure purposes, to the national safety authority, the Agency or the regulator of railways. Its investigations should be carried out with as much openness as possible. For each occurrence, the investigating body should establish the relevant investigation group possessing the expertise needed to find the immediate and underlying causes.\n(39)\nAn investigation after a serious accident should be carried out in such a way that all parties are given the possibility to be heard and to share the results. In particular, during the investigation, the investigating body should update the parties whom it judges as having safety-related responsibility on the progress of the investigation, and should take account of their views and opinions. This will allow the investigating body to receive any additional relevant information and to be aware of different opinions on its work so that it can complete its investigation in the most appropriate manner. Such consultation should in no case lead to apportioning blame or liability but, rather, to collecting factual evidence and learning lessons for the future improvement of safety. The investigating body should, however, be free to choose the information it intends to share with such parties in order to avoid any undue pressure, except when this is requested by those conducting the judicial procedure. The investigating body should also take account of the reasonable information needs of any victims and of their relatives.\n(40)\nIn order to improve the efficiency of their activities and to facilitate the discharge of their duties, investigating bodies should have timely access to the site of an accident, where necessary in good cooperation with any judicial authority involved in the matter. The reports on investigations and any findings and recommendations provide crucial information for the further improvement of railway safety and should be made publicly available at Union level. Safety recommendations should be acted upon by the addressees and actions reported back to the investigating body.\n(41)\nIn the event that the direct cause of an accident or incident seems to be related to human actions, attention should be paid to the particular circumstances and the manner in which routine activities are performed by staff during normal operations, including the design of the man-machine interface, the suitability of procedures, conflicting objectives, workload and any other circumstances which may have influence on the occurrence, including physical and work-related stress, fatigue or psychological fitness.\n(42)\nEfforts should be made to ensure that a high level of training and advanced qualifications is available across the Union.\n(43)\nIn order to supplement and amend certain non-essential elements of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of CSMs and CSTs, and their revision. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(44)\nImplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive with regard to the mandate of the Agency to draft CSMs and CSTs and their amendments and to make the relevant recommendations to the Commission; practical arrangements for the purpose of safety certification; detailed provisions identifying which of the requirements set out in Annex III are to apply for the purpose of maintenance functions carried out by maintenance workshops, including detailed provisions to ensure the uniform implementation of certification of maintenance workshops, in compliance with the relevant CSM and TSIs; detailed provisions identifying which of the requirements set out in Annex III are to apply for the purpose of certification of entities in charge of maintenance of the vehicles other than freight wagons, on the basis of the technical characteristics of such vehicles, including detailed provisions to ensure uniform implementation of certification conditions for the entity in charge of maintenance for vehicles other than freight wagons, in compliance with the relevant CSM and TSIs and the reporting structure of the accident and incident investigation report. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n(45)\nThe Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(46)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely coordinating activities in the Member States in order to regulate and supervise safety, investigating accidents and establishing CSTs, CSMs, CSIs and common requirements for single safety certificates, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(47)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions representing a substantive amendment as compared to Directive 2004/49/EC. The obligation to transpose the provisions that are unchanged arises under that Directive.\n(48)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligation of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Part B of Annex IV,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down provisions to ensure the development and improvement of the safety of the Union rail system and improved access to the market for rail transport services by:\n(a)\nharmonising the regulatory structure in the Member States;\n(b)\ndefining responsibilities between the actors in the Union rail system;\n(c)\ndeveloping common safety targets (‘CSTs’) and common safety methods (‘CSMs’) with a view to gradually removing the need for national rules;\n(d)\nsetting out the principles for issuing, renewing, amending and restricting or revoking safety certificates and authorisations;\n(e)\nrequiring the establishment, for each Member State, of a national safety authority and an accident and incident investigating body; and\n(f)\ndefining common principles for the management, regulation and supervision of railway safety.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Directive applies to the rail system in the Member States, which may be broken down into subsystems for structural and functional areas. It covers safety requirements for the system as a whole, including the safe management of infrastructure and of traffic operation and the interaction between railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and other actors in the Union rail system.\n2.   This Directive shall not apply to:\n(a)\nmetros;\n(b)\ntrams and light rail vehicles, and infrastructure used exclusively by those vehicles; or\n(c)\nnetworks that are functionally separate from the rest of the Union rail system and intended only for the operation of local, urban or suburban passenger services, as well as undertakings operating solely on those networks.\n3.   Member States may exclude from the scope of the measures implementing this Directive:\n(a)\nprivately owned railway infrastructure, including sidings, used by the owner or by an operator for the purpose of their respective freight activities or for the transport of persons for non-commercial purposes, and vehicles used exclusively on such infrastructure;\n(b)\ninfrastructure and vehicles reserved for strictly local, historical or tourist use;\n(c)\nlight rail infrastructure occasionally used by heavy rail vehicles under the operational conditions of the light rail system, where it is necessary for the purposes of connectivity of those vehicles only; and\n(d)\nvehicles primarily used on light rail infrastructure but equipped with some heavy rail components necessary to enable transit to be effected on a confined and limited section of heavy rail infrastructure for connectivity purposes only.\n4.

On the basis of the information provided by the national safety authorities in accordance with Articles 17 and 19, the Agency may address a recommendation to the Commission for a CSM covering elements of the safety management system which need to be harmonised at Union level, including through harmonised standards, as referred to in point (f) of Article 6(1). In such case, Article 6(2) shall apply.\nCHAPTER III\nSAFETY CERTIFICATION AND AUTHORISATION\nArticle 10\nSingle safety certificate\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 9, access to the railway infrastructure shall be granted only to railway undertakings which hold the single safety certificate issued by the Agency in accordance with paragraphs 5 to 7 or by a national safety authority in accordance with paragraph 8.\nThe purpose of the single safety certificate is to provide evidence that the railway undertaking concerned has established its safety management system and that it is able to operate safely in the intended area of operation.\n2.   In its application for a single safety certificate, the railway undertaking shall specify the type and extent of the railway operations covered and the intended area of operation.\n3.   The application for a single safety certificate shall be accompanied by a file including documentary evidence that:\n(a)\nthe railway undertaking has established its safety management system in accordance with Article 9 and that it meets the requirements laid down in TSIs, CSMs and CSTs and in other relevant legislation in order to control risks and provide transport services safely on the network; and\n(b)\nthe railway undertaking, where applicable, meets the requirements laid down in the relevant national rules notified in accordance with Article 8.\nThat application and information about all applications, the stages of the relevant procedures and their outcome, and, where applicable, the requests and decisions of the Board of Appeal, shall be submitted through the one-stop shop referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/796.\n4.   The Agency, or in the cases provided for by paragraph 8 the national safety authority, shall issue the single safety certificate, or inform the applicant of its negative decision, within a predetermined and reasonable time, and, in any case, not more than 4 months after all information required and any supplementary information requested have been submitted by the applicant. The Agency, or in the cases provided for by paragraph 8 the national safety authority, shall apply the practical arrangements on the certification procedure to be established in an implementing act, as referred to in paragraph 10.\n5.   The Agency shall issue a single safety certificate to railway undertakings having an area of operation in one or more Member States. In order to issue such a certificate, the Agency shall:\n(a)\nassess the elements set out in point (a) of paragraph 3; and\n(b)\nimmediately refer the railway undertaking's file in its entirety to the national safety authorities concerned by the intended area of operation for an assessment of the elements set out in point (b) of paragraph 3.\nAs part of the above assessments, the Agency or the national safety authorities shall be authorised to undertake visits and inspections on the sites of the railway undertaking and audits, and may request relevant supplementary information. The Agency and the national safety authorities shall coordinate the organisation of such visits, audits and inspections.\n6.   Within 1 month of receipt of an application for a single safety certificate, the Agency shall inform the railway undertaking that the file is complete or ask for relevant supplementary information, setting a reasonable deadline for the provision thereof. With regard to the completeness, relevance and consistency of the file, the Agency may also assess the elements set out in point (b) of paragraph 3.\nThe Agency shall take full account of the assessments under paragraph 5 before taking its decision on the issuing of the single safety certificate.\nThe Agency shall take full responsibility for any single safety certificates it issues.\n7.   Where the Agency disagrees with a negative assessment carried out by one or more national safety authorities pursuant to point (b) of paragraph 5, it shall inform that authority or authorities in question, giving reasons for its disagreement. The Agency and the national safety authority or authorities shall cooperate with a view to agreeing on a mutually acceptable assessment. Where necessary, the Agency and the national safety authority or authorities may decide to involve the railway undertaking. If no mutually acceptable assessment can be agreed on within 1 month after the Agency has informed the national safety authority or authorities of its disagreement, the Agency shall take its final decision unless the national safety authority or authorities have referred the matter for arbitration to the Board of Appeal established under Article 55 of Regulation (EU) 2016/796. The Board of Appeal shall decide whether to confirm the Agency's draft decision within 1 month of the request of the national safety authority or authorities.\nWhere the Board of Appeal agrees with the Agency, the Agency shall take a decision without delay.\nWhere the Board of Appeal agrees with the negative assessment of the national safety authority, the Agency shall grant a single safety certificate with an area of operations excluding the parts of the network which received a negative assessment.\nWhere the Agency disagrees with a positive assessment of one or more national safety authorities pursuant to point (b) of paragraph 5, it shall inform the authority or authorities in question, giving reasons for its disagreement. The Agency and the national safety authority or authorities shall cooperate with a view to agreeing on a mutually acceptable assessment. Where necessary, the Agency and the national safety authority or authorities may decide to involve the applicant. If no mutually acceptable assessment can be agreed on within 1 month after the Agency has informed the national safety authority or authorities of its disagreement, the Agency shall take its final decision.\n8.   Where the area of operation is limited to one Member State, the national safety authority of that Member State may, under its own responsibility and when the applicant so requests, issue a single safety certificate. In order to issue such certificates, the national safety authority shall assess the file in relation to all the elements specified in paragraph 3 and shall apply the practical arrangements to be established in the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 10. As part of the above assessments, the national safety authority shall be authorised to undertake visits and inspections on the sites of the railway undertaking and audits. Within 1 month of receipt of the application, the national safety authority shall inform the applicant that the file is complete or ask for relevant supplementary information. The single safety certificate shall also be valid without an extension of the area of operations for railway undertakings travelling to stations in neighbouring Member States with similar network characteristics and similar operating rules, when those stations are close to the border, following consultation of the competent national safety authorities. This consultation may be carried out on a case-by-case basis or set out in a cross-border agreement between Member States or national safety authorities.\nThe national safety authority shall take full responsibility for any single safety certificates it issues.\n9.   A Member State may allow third-country operators to reach a station in its territory designated for cross-border operations and close to the border of that Member State without requiring a single safety certificate, provided that an appropriate level of safety is ensured through:\n(a)\ncross-border agreement between the Member State concerned and the neighbouring third country; or\n(b)\ncontractual arrangements between the third-country operator and the railway undertaking or infrastructure manager that has a single safety certificate or safety authorisation to operate on that network, provided that the safety-related aspects of those arrangements have been duly reflected in their safety management system.\n10.   By 16 June 2018, the Commission shall adopt, by means of implementing acts, practical arrangements specifying:\n(a)\nhow the requirements for the single safety certificate laid down in this Article shall be fulfilled by the applicant and listing the documents required;\n(b)\nthe details of the certification process, such as procedural stages and timeframes for each stage of the process;\n(c)\nhow the requirements laid down in this Article shall to be complied with by the Agency and the national safety authority through the different stages of the application and certification process, including in the assessment of applicants' files; and\n(d)\nthe period of validity of single safety certificates issued by the Agency or by the national safety authorities, in particular in the case of updates of any single safety certificate resulting from changes to type, extent and area of operation.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 28(3). They shall take into account the experience gained during the implementation of Commission Regulation (EC) No 653/2007 (14) and of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1158/2010 (15) and the experience gained during the preparation of the cooperation agreements referred to in Article 11(1).\n11.   Single safety certificates shall specify the type and extent of the railway operations covered and the area of operation. A single safety certificate may also cover sidings owned by the railway undertaking if these are included in its safety management system.\n12.   Any decision refusing the issuing of a single safety certificate or excluding part of the network in accordance with a negative assessment as referred to in paragraph 7 shall be duly substantiated. The applicant may, within 1 month of receipt of the decision, request that the Agency or the national safety authority, as appropriate, review the decision. The Agency or the national safety authority shall have 2 months from the date of receipt of the request for review in which to confirm or reverse its decision.\nIf the negative decision of the Agency is confirmed, the applicant may bring an appeal before the Board of Appeal designated under Article 55 of Regulation (EU) 2016/796.\nIf the negative decision of a national safety authority is confirmed, the applicant may bring an appeal before an appeal body in accordance with national law. Member States may designate the regulatory body referred to in Article 56 of Directive 2012/34/EU for the purpose of this appeal procedure. In that case, Article 18(3) of this Directive shall apply.\n13.   A single safety certificate issued either by the Agency or by a national safety authority under this Article shall be renewed upon application by the railway undertaking at intervals not exceeding 5 years. It shall be fully or partly updated whenever the type or extent of the operation is substantially altered.\n14.   Where an applicant already has a single safety certificate issued in accordance with paragraphs 5 to 7 and wishes to extend its area of operations, or where it already has a single safety certificate issued in accordance with paragraph 8 and wishes to extend its area of operations to another Member State, it shall supplement the file with the relevant documents referred to in paragraph 3 concerning the additional area of operation. The railway undertaking shall submit the file to the Agency, which shall, after following the procedures laid down in paragraphs 4 to 7, issue an updated single safety certificate covering the extended area of operation. In that case, only the national safety authorities concerned by the extension of operation shall be consulted for the purposes of assessing the file as provided for in point (b) of paragraph 3.\nIf the railway undertaking has a single safety certificate in accordance with paragraph 8 and wishes to extend the area of operation within that Member State, it shall supplement the file with the relevant documents referred to in paragraph 3 concerning the additional area of operation. It shall submit the file, through the one-stop shop referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/796, to the national safety authority, which shall, after following the procedures laid down in paragraph 8, issue an updated single safety certificate covering the extended area of operation.\n15.   The Agency and the competent national safety authorities may require the revision of single safety certificates issued by them following substantial changes to the safety regulatory framework.\n16.   The Agency shall inform the competent national safety authorities without delay, and in any case within 2 weeks, of the issue of a single safety certificate. The Agency shall inform the competent national safety authorities immediately in the case of renewal, amendment or revocation of a single safety certificate. It shall state the name and address of the railway undertaking, the issue date, the type, extent, validity and area of operation of the single safety certificate and, in the case of revocation, the reasons for its decision. In the case of single safety certificates issued by national safety authorities, the same information shall be provided by the competent national safety authority or authorities to the Agency within the same timeframe.\nArticle 11\nCooperation between the Agency and national safety authorities on issuing single safety certificates\n1.   For the purposes of Article 10(5) and (6) of this Directive, the Agency and the national safety authorities shall conclude cooperation agreements in accordance with Article 76 of Regulation (EU) 2016/796. The cooperation agreements shall be specific or framework agreements, and shall involve one or more national safety authorities. The cooperation agreements shall contain a detailed description of tasks and conditions for deliverables, the time limits applying to their delivery and an apportionment of the fees payable by the applicant.\n2.   The cooperation agreements may also include specific cooperation arrangements in the case of networks requiring specific expertise for geographical or historical reasons, with a view to reducing administrative burdens and costs to the applicant. Where such networks are isolated from the rest of the Union rail system, such specific cooperation arrangements may include the possibility of contracting tasks to the relevant national safety authorities when this is necessary in order to ensure efficient and proportionate allocation of resources for certification. Those cooperation agreements shall be in place before the Agency carries out the certification tasks in accordance with Article 31(3).\n3.   In the case of those Member States whose rail networks have a track gauge that is different from that of the main rail network within the Union and share identical technical and operational requirements with neighbouring third countries, in addition to the cooperation agreements referred to in paragraph 2 all the national safety authorities concerned in those Member States shall conclude with the Agency a multilateral agreement which shall include the conditions to facilitate the extension of the area of operation of safety certificates in the Member States concerned, where relevant.\nArticle 12\nSafety authorisation of infrastructure managers\n1.   In order to be allowed to manage and operate a rail infrastructure, the infrastructure manager shall obtain a safety authorisation from the national safety authority in the Member State where the rail infrastructure is located.\nThe safety authorisation shall comprise an authorisation confirming acceptance of the infrastructure manager's safety management system as provided for in Article 9, and shall include the procedures and provisions fulfilling the requirements necessary for the safe design, maintenance and operation of the railway infrastructure, including, where appropriate, the maintenance and operation of the traffic control and signalling system.\nThe national safety authority shall explain the requirements for the safety authorisations and the documents required, where appropriate in the form of an application guidance document.\n2.   The safety authorisation shall be valid for 5 years and may be renewed upon application by the infrastructure manager. It shall be wholly or partly revised whenever substantial changes are made to the infrastructure, signalling or energy subsystems or to the principles of their operation and maintenance. The infrastructure manager shall inform the national safety authority of all such changes without delay.\nThe national safety authority may require that the safety authorisation be revised following substantial changes to the safety regulatory framework.\n3.   The national safety authority shall take a decision on an application for safety authorisation without delay and in any event not more than 4 months after all the information required and any supplementary information requested has been submitted by the applicant.\n4.   The national safety authority shall inform the Agency without delay, and in any event within 2 weeks, of the safety authorisations that have been issued, renewed, amended or revoked. It shall state the name and address of the infrastructure manager, the issue date, scope and period of validity of the safety authorisation and, in the event of revocation, the reasons for its decision.\n5.   In the case of cross-border infrastructure, the competent national safety authorities shall cooperate in order to issue the safety authorisations.\nArticle 13\nAccess to training facilities\n1.   Member States shall ensure that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers and their staff performing safety-critical tasks have fair and non-discriminatory access to training facilities for train drivers and staff accompanying trains, whenever such training is necessary for operating services on their network.\nThe training services shall include training on necessary route knowledge, operating rules and procedures, the signalling and control-command system and emergency procedures applied on the routes operated.\nIf the training services do not include examinations and granting of certificates, Member States shall ensure that staff of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers have access to such certificates.\nThe national safety authority shall ensure that the training services meet the requirements laid down respectively in Directive 2007/59/EC, in TSIs or in the national rules referred to in point (e) of Article 8(3) of this Directive.\n2.   If the training facilities are available only through a single railway undertaking or the infrastructure manager, Member States shall ensure that they are made available to other railway undertakings at a reasonable and non-discriminatory price which is cost-related and which may include a profit margin.\n3.   When recruiting new train drivers, staff on board trains and staff performing safety-critical tasks, railway undertakings may take into account any training, qualifications and experience acquired previously from other railway undertakings. For that purpose, such members of staff shall be entitled to have access to, obtain copies of, and communicate all documents attesting to their training, qualifications and experience.\n4.   Railway undertakings and infrastructure managers shall be responsible for the level of training and qualifications of their staff carrying out safety-critical work.\nArticle 14\nMaintenance of vehicles\n1.   Each vehicle, before it is being used on the network, shall have an entity in charge of maintenance assigned to it and this entity shall be registered in the vehicle register in accordance with Article 47 of Directive (EU) 2016/797.\n2.   Without prejudice to the responsibility of the railway undertakings and infrastructure managers for the safe operation of a train as provided for in Article 4, the entity in charge of maintenance shall ensure that the vehicles for the maintenance of which it is in charge are in a safe state of running. To that end, the entity in charge of maintenance shall establish a maintenance system for those vehicles and shall by means of that system:\n(a)\nensure that vehicles are maintained in accordance with the maintenance file of each vehicle and the requirements in force, including maintenance rules and relevant TSI provisions;\n(b)\nimplement the necessary risk evaluation and assessment methods established in the CSMs as referred to in point (a) of Article 6(1), where appropriate in cooperation with other actors;\n(c)\nensure that its contractors implement risk control measures through the application of the CSM on monitoring referred to in point (c) of Article 6(1) and that this is stipulated in contractual arrangements to be disclosed on request of the Agency or the national safety authority; and\n(d)\nensure the traceability of the maintenance activities.\n3.   The maintenance system shall be composed of the following functions:\n(a)\na management function to supervise and coordinate the maintenance functions referred to in points (b) to (d) and to ensure the safe state of the vehicle in the railway system;\n(b)\na maintenance development function responsible to manage the maintenance documentation, including the configuration management, based on design and operational data as well as on performance and return on experience;\n(c)\na fleet-maintenance management function to manage the vehicle's removal for maintenance and its return to operation after maintenance;\n(d)\na maintenance delivery function to deliver the required technical maintenance of a vehicle or parts of it, including the release to service documentation.\nThe entity in charge of maintenance shall carry out the management function itself, but may outsource the maintenance functions referred to in points (b) to (d), or parts thereof, to other contracting parties such as maintenance workshops.\nThe entity in charge of maintenance shall ensure that all the functions set out in points (a) to (d) comply with the requirements and assessment criteria set out in Annex III.\nMaintenance workshops shall apply relevant sections of Annex III as identified in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 8, which correspond to the functions and activities to be certified.\n4.   In the case of freight wagons, and after the adoption of the implementing acts referred to in point (b) of paragraph 8 in the case of other vehicles, each entity in charge of maintenance shall be certified and be awarded an entity in charge of maintenance certificate (ECM certificate) by an accredited or recognised body or by a national safety authority in accordance with the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe accreditation and recognition processes of certification processes shall be based on criteria of independence, competence and impartiality;\n(b)\nthe system of certification shall provide evidence that an entity in charge of maintenance has established the maintenance system to ensure the safe state of running of any vehicle for which it is in charge of maintenance;\n(c)\nthe ECM certification shall be based on an assessment of the ability of the entity in charge of maintenance to meet the relevant requirements and assessment criteria set out in Annex III and to apply them consistently. It shall include a system of surveillance to ensure continuing compliance with those requirements and assessment criteria after award of the ECM certificate;\n(d)\nthe certification of maintenance workshops shall be based on the compliance with the relevant sections in Annex III applied to the corresponding functions and activities to be certified.\nWhere the entity in charge of maintenance is a railway undertaking or an infrastructure manager, compliance with the conditions set out in the first subparagraph may be checked by the national safety authority pursuant to the procedures referred to in Article 10 or 12 and may be confirmed on the certificates issued in accordance with those procedures.\n5.   The certificates issued in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be valid throughout the Union.\n6.   On the basis of the recommendation of the Agency, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt detailed provisions on the certification conditions referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 for the entity in charge of maintenance of freight wagons, including the requirements set out in Annex III in compliance with the relevant CSM and TSIs, and, when necessary, shall amend those provisions.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 28(3).\nThe certification system applicable to freight wagons adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 445/2011 (16) shall continue to apply until the implementing acts referred to in this paragraph apply.\n7.   By 16 June 2018, the Agency shall evaluate the system of certification of the entity in charge of maintenance for freight wagons, consider the expediency of extending that system to all vehicles and the mandatory certification of maintenance workshops and submit its report to the Commission.\n8.   On the basis of the evaluation carried out by the Agency pursuant to paragraph 7, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt, if appropriate, and, when necessary, subsequently amend detailed provisions identifying which of the requirements set out in Annex III shall apply for the purpose of:\n(a)\nmaintenance functions carried out by maintenance workshops, including detailed provisions to ensure the uniform implementation of the certification of maintenance workshops, in compliance with the relevant CSM and TSIs;\n(b)\nthe certification of entities in charge of maintenance of vehicles other than freight wagons, on the basis of the technical characteristics of such vehicles, including detailed provisions to ensure the uniform implementation of the certification conditions by the entity in charge of maintenance for vehicles other than freight wagons, in compliance with the relevant CSM and TSIs.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 28(3).\nArticle 15\nDerogations from the system of certification of entities in charge of maintenance\n1.   Member States may fulfil the obligation to identify the entity in charge of maintenance through alternative measures with respect to the maintenance system established in Article 14, in the following cases:\n(a)\nvehicles registered in a third country and maintained in accordance with the law of that country;\n(b)\nvehicles used on networks or lines the track gauge of which is different from that of the main rail network within the Union and in respect of which fulfilment of the requirements laid down in Article 14(2) is ensured by international agreements with third countries;\n(c)\nfreight wagons and passenger coaches which are in shared use with third countries the track gauge of which is different from that of the main rail network within the Union;\n(d)\nvehicles used on the networks referred to in Article 2(3), and military equipment and special transport requiring an ad hoc national safety authority permit to be delivered prior to their entry into service. In this case derogations shall be granted for periods not longer than 5 years.\n2.   The alternative measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be implemented through derogations to be granted by the relevant national safety authority or by the Agency when:\n(a)\nregistering vehicles pursuant to Article 47 of Directive (EU) 2016/797, as far as the identification of the entity in charge of maintenance is concerned;\n(b)\ndelivering single safety certificates and safety authorisations to railway undertakings and infrastructure managers pursuant to Articles 10 and 12 of this Directive, as far as the identification or certification of the entity in charge of maintenance is concerned.\n3.   Derogations shall be identified and justified in the annual report referred to in Article 19. Where it appears that undue safety risks are being taken on the Union rail system, the Agency shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. The Commission shall make contact with the parties concerned and, where appropriate, request the Member State concerned to withdraw its derogation decision.\nCHAPTER IV\nNATIONAL SAFETY AUTHORITIES\nArticle 16\nTasks\n1.   Each Member State shall establish a national safety authority. Member States shall ensure that the national safety authority has the necessary internal and external organisational capacity in terms of human and material resources. That authority shall be independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision-making from any railway undertaking, infrastructure manager, applicant or contracting entity and from any entity awarding public service contracts. Provided that such independence is guaranteed, that authority may be a department within the national ministry responsible for transport matters.\n2.   The national safety authority shall be entrusted with at least the following tasks:\n(a)\nauthorising the placing in service of the trackside control-command and signalling, energy and infrastructure subsystems constituting the Union rail system in accordance with Article 18(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/797;\n(b)\nissuing, renewing, amending and revoking vehicle authorisations for placing on the market in accordance with Article 21(8) of Directive (EU) 2016/797;\n(c)\nsupporting the Agency in the issuing, renewal, amendment and revocation of vehicle authorisations for placing on the market in accordance with Article 21(5) of Directive (EU) 2016/797 and type authorisations of vehicle in accordance with Article 24 of Directive (EU) 2016/797;\n(d)\nsupervising, in its territory, that interoperability constituents are in compliance with the essential requirements as required by Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2016/797;\n(e)\nensuring that a vehicle number has been assigned in accordance with Article 46 of Directive (EU) 2016/797, without prejudice to Article 47(4) of that Directive;\n(f)\nsupporting the Agency in the issuing, renewal, amendment and revocation of single safety certificates granted in accordance with Article 10(5);\n(g)\nissuing, renewing, amending and revoking single safety certificates granted in accordance with Article 10(8);\n(h)\nissuing, renewing, amending and revoking safety authorisations granted in accordance with Article 12;\n(i)\nmonitoring, promoting, and, where appropriate, enforcing and updating the safety regulatory framework including the system of national rules;\n(j)\nsupervising railway undertakings and infrastructure managers in accordance with Article 17;\n(k)\nwhere relevant, and in accordance with national law, issuing, renewing, amending and revoking train driving licences in accordance with Directive 2007/59/EC;\n(l)\nwhere relevant, and in accordance with national law, issuing, renewing, amending and revoking certificates granted to entities in charge of maintenance.\n3.   The tasks referred to in paragraph 2 may not be transferred or subcontracted to any infrastructure manager, railway undertaking or contracting entity.\nArticle 17\nSupervision\n1.   National safety authorities shall oversee continued compliance with the legal obligation incumbent on railway undertakings and infrastructure managers to use a safety management system as referred to in Article 9.\nFor that purpose, the national safety authorities shall apply the principles set out in the relevant CSMs for supervision referred to in point (c) of Article 6(1), ensuring that supervision activities include, in particular, checking the application by railway undertakings and infrastructure managers of:\n(a)\nthe safety management system to monitor its effectiveness;\n(b)\nthe individual or partial elements of the safety management system, including operational activities, the supply of maintenance and material and the use of contractors to monitor their effectiveness; and\n(c)\nthe relevant CSMs referred to in Article 6. The supervision activities relating to this point shall also apply to entities in charge of maintenance, where appropriate.\n2.   Railway undertakings shall inform the relevant national safety authorities at least 2 months before starting any new rail transport operation, in order to allow the latter to plan the supervision activities. Railway undertakings shall also provide a breakdown of the categories of staff and the types of vehicles.\n3.   The holder of a single safety certificate shall inform the competent national safety authorities without delay of any major changes to the information referred to in paragraph 2.\n4.   The monitoring of compliance with applicable working, driving and rest-time rules for train drivers shall be ensured by competent authorities designated by Member States. Where the monitoring of compliance is not ensured by national safety authorities, the competent authorities shall cooperate with the national safety authorities with a view to allowing the national safety authorities to fulfil their role of supervision of railway safety.\n5.   If a national safety authority finds that a holder of a single safety certificate no longer satisfies the conditions for certification, it shall ask the Agency to restrict or revoke that certificate. The Agency shall immediately inform all the competent national safety authorities. If the Agency decides to restrict or revoke the single safety certificate, it shall give reasons for its decision.\nIn the event of disagreement between the Agency and the national safety authority, the arbitration procedure indicated in Article 10(7) shall apply. If the result of that arbitration procedure is that the single safety certificate is to be neither restricted nor revoked, the temporary safety measures referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article shall be suspended.\nWhere the national safety authority has itself issued the single safety certificate in accordance with Article 10(8), it may restrict or revoke the certificate, giving reasons for its decision, and shall inform the Agency.\nThe holder of a single safety certificate whose certificate has been restricted or revoked either by the Agency or by the national safety authority shall have the right to appeal in accordance with Article 10(12).\n6.   If, during supervision, a national safety authority identifies a serious safety risk, it may at any time apply temporary safety measures, including immediately restricting or suspending the relevant operations. If the single safety certificate was issued by the Agency, the national safety authority shall immediately inform the Agency thereof and provide supporting evidence for its decision.\nIf the Agency finds that the holder of a single safety certificate no longer satisfies the conditions for certification, it shall immediately restrict or revoke that certificate.\nIf the Agency finds that the measures applied by the national safety authority are disproportionate, it may ask the national safety authority to withdraw or adapt those measures. The Agency and the national safety authority shall cooperate with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. Where necessary, this process shall also involve the railway undertaking. If the latter procedure fails, the decision of the national safety authority to apply temporary measures shall remain in force.\nThe decision of the national safety authority relating to temporary safety measures shall be subject to national judicial review as referred to in Article 18(3). In such a case, the temporary safety measures may apply until the end of the judicial review, without prejudice to paragraph 5.\nIf the duration of a temporary measure is longer than 3 months, the national safety authority shall ask the Agency to restrict or revoke the single safety certificate and the procedure set out in paragraph 5 shall apply.\n7.   The national safety authority shall supervise the trackside, control-command and signalling, energy and infrastructure subsystems and ensure that they are in compliance with the essential requirements. In the case of cross-border infrastructures, it will perform its activities of supervision in cooperation with other relevant national safety authorities. If the national safety authority finds that an infrastructure manager no longer satisfies the conditions for its safety authorisation, it shall restrict or revoke that authorisation, giving reasons for its decision.\n8.   When supervising the effectiveness of the safety management systems of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, the national safety authorities may take into account the safety performance of actors as referred to in Article 4(4) of this Directive, and, where appropriate, the training centres referred to in Directive 2007/59/EC as long as their activities have an impact on railway safety. This paragraph applies without prejudice to the responsibility of the railway undertakings and infrastructure managers referred to in Article 4(3) of this Directive.\n9.   The national safety authorities of Member States where a railway undertaking operates shall cooperate in coordinating their supervision activities concerning that railway undertaking to ensure that any key information on the specific railway undertaking is shared, particularly on known risks and its safety performance. The national safety authority shall also share information with other relevant national safety authorities and the Agency if it finds that the railway undertaking is not taking the necessary risk control measures.\nThat cooperation shall ensure that the supervision has sufficient coverage and that the duplication of inspections and audits is avoided. The national safety authorities may develop a common supervision plan in order to ensure that audits and other inspections are carried out periodically, taking into account the type and extent of transport operations in each of the Member States concerned.\nThe Agency shall assist such coordination activities by developing guidelines.\n10.   National safety authorities may address notices to warn infrastructure managers and railway undertakings in cases of non-compliance with their obligations set out in paragraph 1.\n11.   National safety authorities shall use information gathered by the Agency during the assessment of the file referred to in point (a) of Article 10(5) for the purposes of supervision of a railway undertaking after issuing its single safety certificate. They shall use the information gathered during the process of safety authorisation in accordance with Article 12 for the purposes of supervision of the infrastructure manager.\n12.   For the purpose of renewing single safety certificates, the Agency, or the competent national safety authorities in the case of a safety certificate issued in accordance with Article 10(8), shall use information gathered during the supervision activities. For the purpose of renewing safety authorisations, the national safety authority shall also use information gathered during its supervision activities.\n13.   The Agency and the national safety authorities shall make the necessary arrangements to coordinate and ensure the full exchange of information referred to in paragraphs 10, 11 and 12.\nArticle 18\nDecision-making principles\n1.   The Agency, when considering applications for a single safety certificate in accordance with Article 10(1), and the national safety authorities shall carry out their tasks in an open, non-discriminatory and transparent way. In particular, they shall allow all interested parties to be heard and give reasons for their decisions.\nThey shall promptly respond to requests and applications and communicate their requests for information without delay and adopt all their decisions within 4 months after all relevant information has been provided by the applicant. They may at any time request the technical assistance of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings or other qualified bodies when they are carrying out the tasks referred to in Article 16.\nIn the process of developing the national regulatory framework, the national safety authorities shall consult all actors and interested parties, including infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, manufacturers and maintenance providers, users and staff representatives.\n2.   The national safety authorities shall be free to carry out all inspections, audits and investigations that are needed for the accomplishment of their tasks, and they shall be granted access to all relevant documents and to premises, installations and equipment of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings and, where necessary, of any actor referred to in Article 4. The Agency shall have the same rights in relation to railway undertakings when it carries out its safety certification tasks in accordance with Article 10(5).\n3.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that decisions taken by the national safety authorities are subject to judicial review.\n4.   The national safety authorities shall conduct an active exchange of views and experience, in particular within the network established by the Agency in order to harmonise their decision-making criteria across the Union.\nArticle 19\nAnnual report\nNational safety authorities shall publish an annual report concerning their activities in the preceding year and send them to the Agency by 30 September. The report shall contain information on:\n(a)\nthe development of railway safety, including an aggregation at Member State level of the CSIs, in accordance with Article 5(1);\n(b)\nimportant changes in legislation and regulation concerning railway safety;\n(c)\nthe development of safety certification and safety authorisation;\n(d)\nthe results of, and experience relating to, the supervision of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, including the number and outcome of inspections and audits;\n(e)\nthe derogations decided in accordance with Article 15; and\n(f)\nthe experience of the railway undertakings and infrastructure managers on the application of the relevant CSMs.\nCHAPTER V\nACCIDENT AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nArticle 20\nObligation to investigate\n1.   Member States shall ensure that an investigation is carried out by the investigating body referred to in Article 22 after any serious accident on the Union rail system. The objective of the investigation shall be to improve, where possible, railway safety and the prevention of accidents.\n2.   The investigating body referred to in Article 22 may also investigate those accidents and incidents which under slightly different conditions might have led to serious accidents, including technical failures of the structural subsystems or of interoperability constituents of the Union rail system.\nThe investigating body may decide whether or not an investigation of such an accident or incident is to be undertaken. In making its decision it shall take into account:\n(a)\nthe seriousness of the accident or incident;\n(b)\nwhether it forms part of a series of accidents or incidents relevant to the system as a whole;\n(c)\nits impact on railway safety; and\n(d)\nrequests from infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, the national safety authority or the Member States.\n3.   The extent of investigations and the procedure to be followed in carrying out investigations shall be determined by the investigating body, taking into account Articles 21 and 23 and depending on the lessons it expects to draw from the accident or incident for the improvement of safety.\n4.   The investigation shall in no case be concerned with apportioning blame or liability.\nArticle 21\nStatus of investigation\n1.   Member States shall define, within the framework of their respective legal system, the legal status of the investigation that is to enable the investigators-in-charge to carry out their task in the most efficient way and within the shortest time.\n2.   In accordance with their national legislation, Member States shall ensure full cooperation by the authorities responsible for any judicial inquiry, and shall ensure that the investigators are given access as soon as possible to information and evidence relevant for the investigation. In particular, they shall be granted:\n(a)\nimmediate access to the site of the accident or incident as well as to the rolling stock involved, the related infrastructure and traffic control and signalling installations;\n(b)\nthe right to an immediate listing of evidence and controlled removal of wreckage, infrastructure installations or components for examination or analysis purposes;\n(c)\nunrestricted access to, and use of, the contents of on-board recorders and equipment for the recording of verbal messages and registration of the operation of the signalling and traffic control system;\n(d)\naccess to the results of examination of the bodies of victims;\n(e)\naccess to the results of examinations of the train staff and other railway staff involved in the accident or incident;\n(f)\nthe opportunity to question the railway staff involved in the accident or incident and other witnesses; and\n(g)\naccess to any relevant information or records held by the infrastructure manager, railway undertakings, entities in charge of maintenance and national safety authority concerned.\n3.   The Agency shall cooperate with the investigating body when the investigation involves vehicles authorised by the Agency or railway undertakings certified by the Agency. It shall as soon as possible submit all requested information or records to the investigating body and provide explanations, where requested.\n4.   The investigation shall be carried out independently of any judicial inquiry.\nArticle 22\nInvestigating body\n1.   Each Member State shall ensure that investigations of the accidents and incidents referred to in Article 20 are conducted by a permanent body, which shall comprise at least one investigator able to perform the function of investigator-in-charge in the event of an accident or incident. That body shall be independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision-making from any infrastructure manager, railway undertaking, charging body, allocation body and conformity assessment body and from any party whose interests could conflict with the tasks entrusted to the investigating body. It shall, furthermore, be functionally independent from the national safety authority, from the Agency and from any regulator of railways.\n2.   The investigating body shall perform its tasks independently of the other entities referred to in paragraph 1 and shall be able to obtain sufficient resources to do so. Its investigators shall be afforded status giving them the necessary guarantees of independence.\n3.   Member States shall provide for railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and, where appropriate, the national safety authority to be obliged to immediately notify the accidents and incidents referred to in Article 20 to the investigating body and to provide all available information. Where appropriate, this notification shall be updated as soon as any missing information becomes available.\nThe investigating body shall decide, without delay and in any event no later than 2 months after receipt of the notification concerning the accident or incident, whether or not to start the investigation.\n4.   The investigating body may combine its tasks under this Directive with the work of investigating occurrences other than railway accidents and incidents as long as such other investigations do not endanger its independence.\n5.   If necessary, and provided it does not undermine the independence of the investigating body as provided for in paragraph 1, the investigating body may request the assistance of investigating bodies from other Member States or from the Agency to supply expertise or to carry out technical inspections, analyses or evaluations.\n6.   Member States may entrust the investigating body with the task of carrying out investigations of railway accidents and incidents other than those referred to in Article 20.\n7.   The investigating bodies shall conduct an active exchange of views and experience for the purposes of the development of common investigation methods, drawing up common principles for follow up of safety recommendations and adaptation to the development of technical and scientific progress.\nWithout prejudice to paragraph 1, the Agency shall support the investigating bodies in the performance of this task in accordance with Article 38(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/796.\nThe investigating bodies, with the support of the Agency in accordance with Article 38(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/796, shall establish a programme of peer reviews where all investigating bodies are encouraged to participate so as to monitor their effectiveness and independence. The investigating bodies, with the support of the secretariat referred to in Article 38(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/796, shall publish:\n(a)\nthe common peer-review programme and the review criteria; and\n(b)\nan annual report on the programme, highlighting identified strengths and suggestions for improvements.\nThe peer review reports shall be provided to all investigating bodies and to the Agency. Those reports shall be published on a voluntary basis.\nArticle 23\nInvestigation procedure\n1.   An accident or incident referred to in Article 20 shall be investigated by the investigating body of the Member State in which it occurred. If it is not possible to establish in which Member State it occurred or if it occurred on or close to a border installation between two Member States, the relevant investigating bodies shall agree which of them is to carry out the investigation or agree to carry it out in cooperation with each other. The other investigating body shall, in the first case, be allowed to participate in the investigation and fully share its results.\nInvestigating bodies from other Member States shall be invited, if appropriate, to participate in an investigation where:\n(a)\na railway undertaking established and licensed in one of those Member States is involved in the accident or incident; or\n(b)\na vehicle registered or maintained in one of those Member States is involved in the accident or incident.\nInvestigating bodies from invited Member States shall be provided with the powers necessary to enable them, when requested, to assist in the collection of evidence for another Member State's investigating body.\nInvestigating bodies from invited Member States shall be provided with access to the information and evidence necessary to enable them to participate effectively in the investigation with due respect for national laws relating to judicial proceedings.\nThis paragraph shall not preclude Member States from agreeing that the relevant bodies shall carry out investigations in cooperation with each other in other circumstances.\n2.   For each accident or incident the body responsible for the investigation shall arrange for the appropriate means, comprising the necessary operational and technical expertise, to carry out the investigation. The expertise may be obtained from inside or outside the body, depending on the character of the accident or incident to be investigated.\n3.   The investigation shall be carried out with as much openness as possible, so that all parties can be heard and can share the results. The relevant infrastructure manager and railway undertakings, the national safety authority, the Agency, victims and their relatives, owners of damaged property, manufacturers, the emergency services involved and representatives of staff and users shall be given an opportunity to provide relevant technical information in order to improve the quality of the investigation report. The investigating body shall also take account of the reasonable needs of the victims and their relatives and keep them informed of the progress made in the investigation.\n4.   The investigating body shall conclude its examinations at the accident site in the shortest possible time in order to enable the infrastructure manager to restore the infrastructure and open it to rail transport services as soon as possible.\nArticle 24\nReports\n1.   An investigation of an accident or incident referred to in Article 20 shall be the subject of reports in a form appropriate to the type and seriousness of the accident or incident and the relevance of the investigation findings. The reports shall state the objectives of the investigations as referred to in Article 20(1) and shall contain, where appropriate, safety recommendations.\n2.   The investigating body shall make public the final report in the shortest possible time and normally not later than 12 months after the date of the occurrence.

The Commission regrets that the final text does not contain provisions to this effect.", "summary": "EU-wide rail safety\nEU-wide rail safety\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt aims to enhance railway safety across the EU by revising the role of national safety authorities (NSAs) and reallocating responsibilities between them and the European Union Agency for Railways (the Agency).\nThe directive is one of 3 legislative acts covering the technical aspects of the fourth railway package which aims to revitalise the rail sector and deliver a better quality of service and more choice to passengers. It works alongside Regulation (EU) 2016/796 on the European Union Agency for Railways and Directive (EU) 2016/797 on the interoperability of the EU rail system.\nFollowing the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the directive was amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/698 and Directive (EU) 2020/700 to extend the deadline for incorporating the directive into EU countries’ national law.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive sets out a number of measures to develop and improve safety and to improve access to the market for rail transport services, including:\nestablishing the Agency as a body issuing safety certificates to railway undertakings which operate in more than one EU country;\ndefining the responsibilities between the different bodies involved in the EU rail system;\ndeveloping common safety targets and common safety methods with the aim of removing national rules and therefore barriers to the development of a single European railway area;\nsetting out the principles for issuing, renewing, amending and restricting or revoking safety certificates and authorisations;\nrequiring each EU country to establish a national safety authority and an investigation body for railway accidents and incidents;\ndefining common principles for the management and supervision of railway safety.\nScope\nThe directive applies to the rail system in EU countries, it does not apply to:\nmetros;\ntrams and light rail vehicles and infrastructure used exclusively by those vehicles;\nnetworks that are not part of the EU rail system and that are intended to operate only local, urban or suburban passenger services, along with companies that operate solely on these networks.\nDevelopment and management of safety\nWithin their respective competences under EU law, the Agency and the EU countries are responsible for ensuring that railway safety is maintained and generally improved with a priority placed on preventing accidents.\nEU countries are also responsible for ensuring that: measures to develop and improve safety follow a system-based approach;infrastructure managers and railway companies are responsible for the safe operation of the EU rail system and the control of any associated risks.\nCommon safety methods and targets\nThe assessment of safety levels, the achievement of safety targets and compliance with other safety requirements are established using common safety methods (CSMs). In particular, common methods for: risk and evaluation assessment;assessing conformity for issuing safety certificates and safety authorisations;supervision by national safety authorities and for monitoring by railway companies, infrastructure managers and railway maintenance bodies;assessing the achievement of safety targets at EU and national level.\nMinimum safety targets to be achieved by the EU rail system as a whole are set out in common safety targets (CSTs). CSTs may take the form of risk acceptance criteria or target safety levels.\nSingle safety certificate\nAccess to the EU railway infrastructure will only be granted to companies holding a single safety certificate issued either by the Agency or by the relevant national safety authorities.\nThe purpose of the certificate is to provide evidence that the company concerned has established its safety management system and that it is able to operate safely in its intended area of operation.\nAmendments following the COVID-19 outbreak\nDirective (EU) 2016/798 was due to have taken effect from 16 June 2020. However, to provide the railway sector with greater legal certainty and flexibility to deal with the exceptional circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, amending Directive (EU) 2020/700 was adopted to extend transposition and repeal periods of Directive (EU) 2016/798 (originally set at 16 June 2020 to 31 October 2020). It also aligns the application dates for the CSMs with the revised deadlines.\nRegulation (EU) 2020/698 lays down specific and temporary measures in view of the COVID‐19 outbreak concerning renewing or extending certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponing certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of transport legislation. The regulation extends the time limits laid down in Directive (EU) 2016/798 with regard to the renewal of single safety certificates that expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and the validity of safety authorisations that expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 by 6 months.\nAmendment as regards the application of railway safety and interoperability rules within the Channel Fixed Link\nRegulation (EU) 2020/1530 extends the definition of the national safety authority with regards to any body entrusted by an EU country and a non-EU country and sets out arrangements therewith.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nThe directive has applied since 15 June 2016 and had to become law in the EU countries by 16 June 2020. This date has been further extended by amending Directive (EU) 2020/700 until 31 October 2020.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\n‘Rail Transport: Landmark deal will deliver better rail services to passengers’ — press release (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective (EU) 2016/798 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on railway safety (OJ L 138, 26.5.2016, pp. 102-149)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive (EU) 2016/798 have been incorporated into the original text.
