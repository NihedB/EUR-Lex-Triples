The TMP shall be approved by the responsible funding agency or other relevant agencies involved in financing the technology, taking account of the opinion of the Steering Committee, before the conclusion of the corresponding specific research and development cooperation contracts of research institutes. The TMP shall be developed within the rules and regulations in force in each Party taking into account the aims of the joint research, the financial or other contributions of the Parties and participants, the advantages and disadvantages of licensing by territory or for fields of use, the transfer of export-controlled data, goods or services, requirements imposed by applicable laws and other factors deemed appropriate by the participants. The rights and obligations concerning the research generated by visiting researchers in respect of intellectual property shall also be addressed in the joint technology management plans.With respect to intellectual property, the TMP shall normally address, among other things, ownership, protection, user rights for research and development purposes, exploitation and dissemination, including arrangements for joint publication, the rights and obligations of visiting researchers and dispute settlement procedures.

If one of the Parties becomes aware that it will be, or may be reasonably expected to become, unable to meet the non-dissemination provisions of sections A and B, it shall immediately inform the other Party. The Parties shall thereafter consult to define the most appropriate course of action.--------------------------------------------------", "summary": "Scientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Mexico\nScientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Mexico\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and the United Mexican States\nDecision 2005/766/EC – Conclusion of the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and the United Mexican States\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISION?\n              \nThe agreement establishes the formal rules for cooperation between the European Community, now the European Union (EU), and Mexico, aiming at encouraging, developing and facilitating activities in fields of science and technology of common interest.\nBy its decision, the Council of the European Union approved the conclusion of the agreement on behalf of the European Community.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nActivities carried out under the agreement are based on a set of principles:\nmutual benefit;\nreciprocal opportunities;\ntimely exchange of information;\neffective protection of intellectual property and the equitable sharing of intellectual property rights.\nFields of cooperation\nCooperative activities must be directed towards promoting scientific progress, industrial competitiveness and economic and social development, in particular in the following fields:\nresearch on the environment and climate, including earth observation;\nbiomedical and health research;\nagriculture, forestry and fisheries;\nindustrial and manufacturing technologies;\nresearch on electronics, materials and metrology;\nnon-nuclear energy;\ntransport;\ninformation society technologies;\nresearch on economic and social development;\nbiotechnologies;\naeronautics and space research and applied research; and\nscience and technology policy.\nActivities\nCooperative activities may include:\nthe establishment of networks and long-term institutional alliances between research centres and research and technology institutes, and the joint implementation of projects of common interest;\nthe implementation of research, technological development and demonstration projects between research and business centres in Mexico and Europe, including technology-based companies;\nthe participation of Mexican research institutes in research, technological development and demonstration projects under the existing framework programme for research and innovation, and the reciprocal participation of research institutes established in the EU in Mexican projects;\nvisits and exchanges of scientists, research, technological development and demonstration policymakers and technical experts, including scientific training through research;\nthe joint organisation of scientific seminars, conferences, workshops and symposia, and the participation of experts in such activities;\nthe exchange and sharing of equipment and materials, including the shared use and/or loaning of laboratory infrastructure and equipment;\nthe exchange of information on procedures, laws, regulations and programmes relevant to cooperation under this agreement, and the exchange of experience and studies on best practices in science and technology policy.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 13 June 2005 for an initial period of 5 years, and it may be tacitly renewed after full evaluation, based on the results, during the penultimate year of each successive 5-year period.
