Such refunds may be made conditional on third countries agreeing to take comparable measures (reciprocity).\nRefunds have to be applied for by the non-EEC taxable person. Member States will determine the practical arrangements for claiming these refunds, e.g. time-limits or minimum amounts. They may also require the appointment of a tax representative. They will take all necessary steps to prevent fraud.\nThese refunds must not be made on more favourable conditions than those made to taxable persons established in the EEC.\nEligibility for refunds will be determined according to the domestic rules of the Member States for VAT deductions, although certain expenditures may be excluded or certain conditions imposed.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force - Date of expiry\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective No 86/560/EEC\n11.12.1986\n01.01.1988\nOJ L 326 of 21.11.1986\nLast updated: 31.08.2006", "tags": ["tax harmonisation", "freedom to provide services", "provision of services", "VAT", "tax exemption"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Value added tax", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Taxation", "Approximation of laws"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
