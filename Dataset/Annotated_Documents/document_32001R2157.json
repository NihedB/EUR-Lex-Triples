{"celex_id": "32001R2157", "reference": "10.11.2001\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 294/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2157/2001\nof 8 October 2001\non the Statute for a European company (SE)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe completion of the internal market and the improvement it brings about in the economic and social situation throughout the Community mean not only that barriers to trade must be removed, but also that the structures of production must be adapted to the Community dimension. For that purpose it is essential that companies the business of which is not limited to satisfying purely local needs should be able to plan and carry out the reorganisation of their business on a Community scale.\n(2)\nSuch reorganisation presupposes that existing companies from different Member States are given the option of combining their potential by means of mergers. Such operations can be carried out only with due regard to the rules of competition laid down in the Treaty.\n(3)\nRestructuring and cooperation operations involving companies from different Member States give rise to legal and psychological difficulties and tax problems. The approximation of Member States' company law by means of Directives based on Article 44 of the Treaty can overcome some of those difficulties. Such approximation does not, however, release companies governed by different legal systems from the obligation to choose a form of company governed by a particular national law.\n(4)\nThe legal framework within which business must be carried on in the Community is still based largely on national laws and therefore no longer corresponds to the economic framework within which it must develop if the objectives set out in Article 18 of the Treaty are to be achieved. That situation forms a considerable obstacle to the creation of groups of companies from different Member States.\n(5)\nMember States are obliged to ensure that the provisions applicable to European companies under this Regulation do not result either in discrimination arising out of unjustified different treatment of European companies compared with public limited-liability companies or in disproportionate restrictions on the formation of a European company or on the transfer of its registered office.\n(6)\nIt is essential to ensure as far as possible that the economic unit and the legal unit of business in the Community coincide. For that purpose, provision should be made for the creation, side by side with companies governed by a particular national law, of companies formed and carrying on business under the law created by a Community Regulation directly applicable in all Member States.\n(7)\nThe provisions of such a Regulation will permit the creation and management of companies with a European dimension, free from the obstacles arising from the disparity and the limited territorial application of national company law.\n(8)\nThe Statute for a European public limited-liability company (hereafter referred to as ‘SE’) is among the measures to be adopted by the Council before 1992 listed in the Commission's White Paper on completing the internal market, approved by the European Council that met in Milan in June 1985. The European Council that met in Brussels in 1987 expressed the wish to see such a Statute created swiftly.\n(9)\nSince the Commission's submission in 1970 of a proposal for a Regulation on the Statute for a European public limited-liability company, amended in 1975, work on the approximation of national company law has made substantial progress, so that on those points where the functioning of an SE does not need uniform Community rules reference may be made to the law governing public limited-liability companies in the Member State where it has its registered office.\n(10)\nWithout prejudice to any economic needs that may arise in the future, if the essential objective of legal rules governing SEs is to be attained, it must be possible at least to create such a company as a means both of enabling companies from different Member States to merge or to create a holding company and of enabling companies and other legal persons carrying on economic activities and governed by the laws of different Member States to form joint subsidiaries.\n(11)\nIn the same context it should be possible for a public limited-liability company with a registered office and head office within the Community to transform itself into an SE without going into liquidation, provided it has a subsidiary in a Member State other than that of its registered office.\n(12)\nNational provisions applying to public limited-liability companies that offer their securities to the public and to securities transactions should also apply where an SE is formed by means of an offer of securities to the public and to SEs wishing to utilise such financial instruments.\n(13)\nThe SE itself must take the form of a company with share capital, that being the form most suited, in terms of both financing and management, to the needs of a company carrying on business on a European scale. In order to ensure that such companies are of reasonable size, a minimum amount of capital should be set so that they have sufficient assets without making it difficult for small and medium-sized undertakings to form SEs.\n(14)\nAn SE must be efficiently managed and properly supervised. It must be borne in mind that there are at present in the Community two different systems for the administration of public limited-liability companies. Although an SE should be allowed to choose between the two systems, the respective responsibilities of those responsible for management and those responsible for supervision should be clearly defined.\n(15)\nUnder the rules and general principles of private international law, where one undertaking controls another governed by a different legal system, its ensuing rights and obligations as regards the protection of minority shareholders and third parties are governed by the law governing the controlled undertaking, without prejudice to the obligations imposed on the controlling undertaking by its own law, for example the requirement to prepare consolidated accounts.\n(16)\nWithout prejudice to the consequences of any subsequent coordination of the laws of the Member States, specific rules for SEs are not at present required in this field. The rules and general principles of private international law should therefore be applied both where an SE exercises control and where it is the controlled company.\n(17)\nThe rule thus applicable where an SE is controlled by another undertaking should be specified, and for this purpose reference should be made to the law governing public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE has its registered office.\n(18)\nEach Member State must be required to apply the sanctions applicable to public limited-liability companies governed by its law in respect of infringements of this Regulation.\n(19)\nThe rules on the involvement of employees in the European company are laid down in Directive 2001/86/EC (4), and those provisions thus form an indissociable complement to this Regulation and must be applied concomitantly.\n(20)\nThis Regulation does not cover other areas of law such as taxation, competition, intellectual property or insolvency. The provisions of the Member States' law and of Community law are therefore applicable in the above areas and in other areas not covered by this Regulation.\n(21)\nDirective 2001/86/EC is designed to ensure that employees have a right of involvement in issues and decisions affecting the life of their SE. Other social and labour legislation questions, in particular the right of employees to information and consultation as regulated in the Member States, are governed by the national provisions applicable, under the same conditions, to public limited-liability companies.\n(22)\nThe entry into force of this Regulation must be deferred so that each Member State may incorporate into its national law the provisions of Directive 2001/86/EC and set up in advance the necessary machinery for the formation and operation of SEs with registered offices within its territory, so that the Regulation and the Directive may be applied concomitantly.\n(23)\nA company the head office of which is not in the Community should be allowed to participate in the formation of an SE provided that company is formed under the law of a Member State, has its registered office in that Member State and has a real and continuous link with a Member State's economy according to the principles established in the 1962 General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment. Such a link exists in particular if a company has an establishment in that Member State and conducts operations therefrom.\n(24)\nThe SE should be enabled to transfer its registered office to another Member State. Adequate protection of the interests of minority shareholders who oppose the transfer, of creditors and of holders of other rights should be proportionate. Such transfer should not affect the rights originating before the transfer.\n(25)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to any provision which may be inserted in the 1968 Brussels Convention or in any text adopted by Member States or by the Council to replace such Convention, relating to the rules of jurisdiction applicable in the case of transfer of the registered offices of a public limited-liability company from one Member State to another.\n(26)\nActivities by financial institutions are regulated by specific directives and the national law implementing those directives and additional national rules regulating those activities apply in full to an SE.\n(27)\nIn view of the specific Community character of an SE, the ‘real seat’ arrangement adopted by this Regulation in respect of SEs is without prejudice to Member States' laws and does not pre-empt any choices to be made for other Community texts on company law.\n(28)\nThe Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Regulation, powers of action other than those of Article 308 thereof.\n(29)\nSince the objectives of the intended action, as outlined above, cannot be adequately attained by the Member States in as much as a European public limited-liability company is being established at European level and can therefore, because of the scale and impact of such company, be better attained at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in the said Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to attain these objectives,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\n1.   A company may be set up within the territory of the Community in the form of a European public limited-liability company (Societas Europaea or SE) on the conditions and in the manner laid down in this Regulation.\n2.   The capital of an SE shall be divided into shares. No shareholder shall be liable for more than the amount he has subscribed.\n3.   An SE shall have legal personality.\n4.   Employee involvement in an SE shall be governed by the provisions of Directive 2001/86/EC.\nArticle 2\n1.   Public limited-liability companies such as referred to in Annex I, formed under the law of a Member State, with registered offices and head offices within the Community may form an SE by means of a merger provided that at least two of them are governed by the law of different Member States.\n2.   Public and private limited-liability companies such as referred to in Annex II, formed under the law of a Member State, with registered offices and head offices within the Community may promote the formation of a holding SE provided that each of at least two of them:\n(a)\nis governed by the law of a different Member State, or\n(b)\nhas for at least two years had a subsidiary company governed by the law of another Member State or a branch situated in another Member State.\n3.   Companies and firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty and other legal bodies governed by public or private law, formed under the law of a Member State, with registered offices and head offices within the Community may form a subsidiary SE by subscribing for its shares, provided that each of at least two of them:\n(a)\nis governed by the law of a different Member State, or\n(b)\nhas for at least two years had a subsidiary company governed by the law of another Member State or a branch situated in another Member State.\n4.   A public limited-liability company, formed under the law of a Member State, which has its registered office and head office within the Community may be transformed into an SE if for at least two years it has had a subsidiary company governed by the law of another Member State.\n5.   A Member State may provide that a company the head office of which is not in the Community may participate in the formation of an SE provided that company is formed under the law of a Member State, has its registered office in that Member State and has a real and continuous link with a Member State's economy.\nArticle 3\n1.   For the purposes of Article 2(1), (2) and (3), an SE shall be regarded as a public limited-liability company governed by the law of the Member State in which it has its registered office.\n2.   An SE may itself set up one or more subsidiaries in the form of SEs. The provisions of the law of the Member State in which a subsidiary SE has its registered office that require a public limited-liability company to have more than one shareholder shall not apply in the case of the subsidiary SE. The provisions of national law implementing the twelfth Council Company Law Directive (89/667/EEC) of 21 December 1989 on single-member private limited-liability companies (5) shall apply to SEs mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 4\n1.   The capital of an SE shall be expressed in euro.\n2.   The subscribed capital shall not be less than EUR 120 000.\n3.   The laws of a Member State requiring a greater subscribed capital for companies carrying on certain types of activity shall apply to SEs with registered offices in that Member State.\nArticle 5\nSubject to Article 4(1) and (2), the capital of an SE, its maintenance and changes thereto, together with its shares, bonds and other similar securities shall be governed by the provisions which would apply to a public limited-liability company with a registered office in the Member State in which the SE is registered.\nArticle 6\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, ‘the statutes of the SE’ shall mean both the instrument of incorporation and, where they are the subject of a separate document, the statutes of the SE.\nArticle 7\nThe registered office of an SE shall be located within the Community, in the same Member State as its head office. A Member State may in addition impose on SEs registered in its territory the obligation of locating their head office and their registered office in the same place.\nArticle 8\n1.   The registered office of an SE may be transferred to another Member State in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 13. Such a transfer shall not result in the winding up of the SE or in the creation of a new legal person.\n2.   The management or administrative organ shall draw up a transfer proposal and publicise it in accordance with Article 13, without prejudice to any additional forms of publication provided for by the Member State of the registered office. That proposal shall state the current name, registered office and number of the SE and shall cover:\n(a)\nthe proposed registered office of the SE;\n(b)\nthe proposed statutes of the SE including, where appropriate, its new name;\n(c)\nany implication the transfer may have on employees' involvement;\n(d)\nthe proposed transfer timetable;\n(e)\nany rights provided for the protection of shareholders and/or creditors.\n3.   The management or administrative organ shall draw up a report explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects of the transfer and explaining the implications of the transfer for shareholders, creditors and employees.\n4.   An SE's shareholders and creditors shall be entitled, at least one month before the general meeting called upon to decide on the transfer, to examine at the SE's registered office the transfer proposal and the report drawn up pursuant to paragraph 3 and, on request, to obtain copies of those documents free of charge.\n5.   A Member State may, in the case of SEs registered within its territory, adopt provisions designed to ensure appropriate protection for minority shareholders who oppose a transfer.\n6.   No decision to transfer may be taken for two months after publication of the proposal. Such a decision shall be taken as laid down in Article 59.\n7.   Before the competent authority issues the certificate mentioned in paragraph 8, the SE shall satisfy it that, in respect of any liabilities arising prior to the publication of the transfer proposal, the interests of creditors and holders of other rights in respect of the SE (including those of public bodies) have been adequately protected in accordance with requirements laid down by the Member State where the SE has its registered office prior to the transfer.\nA Member State may extend the application of the first subparagraph to liabilities that arise (or may arise) prior to the transfer.\nThe first and second subparagraphs shall be without prejudice to the application to SEs of the national legislation of Member States concerning the satisfaction or securing of payments to public bodies.\n8.   In the Member State in which an SE has its registered office the court, notary or other competent authority shall issue a certificate attesting to the completion of the acts and formalities to be accomplished before the transfer.\n9.   The new registration may not be effected until the certificate referred to in paragraph 8 has been submitted, and evidence produced that the formalities required for registration in the country of the new registered office have been completed.\n10.   The transfer of an SE's registered office and the consequent amendment of its statutes shall take effect on the date on which the SE is registered, in accordance with Article 12, in the register for its new registered office.\n11.   When the SE's new registration has been effected, the registry for its new registration shall notify the registry for its old registration. Deletion of the old registration shall be effected on receipt of that notification, but not before.\n12.   The new registration and the deletion of the old registration shall be publicised in the Member States concerned in accordance with Article 13.\n13.   On publication of an SE's new registration, the new registered office may be relied on as against third parties. However, as long as the deletion of the SE's registration from the register for its previous registered office has not been publicised, third parties may continue to rely on the previous registered office unless the SE proves that such third parties were aware of the new registered office.\n14.   The laws of a Member State may provide that, as regards SEs registered in that Member State, the transfer of a registered office which would result in a change of the law applicable shall not take effect if any of that Member State's competent authorities opposes it within the two-month period referred to in paragraph 6. Such opposition may be based only on grounds of public interest.\nWhere an SE is supervised by a national financial supervisory authority according to Community directives the right to oppose the change of registered office applies to this authority as well.\nReview by a judicial authority shall be possible.\n15.   An SE may not transfer its registered office if proceedings for winding up, liquidation, insolvency or suspension of payments or other similar proceedings have been brought against it.\n16.   An SE which has transferred its registered office to another Member State shall be considered, in respect of any cause of action arising prior to the transfer as determined in paragraph 10, as having its registered office in the Member States where the SE was registered prior to the transfer, even if the SE is sued after the transfer.\nArticle 9\n1.   An SE shall be governed:\n(a)\nby this Regulation,\n(b)\nwhere expressly authorised by this Regulation, by the provisions of its statutes\nor\n(c)\nin the case of matters not regulated by this Regulation or, where matters are partly regulated by it, of those aspects not covered by it, by:\n(i)\nthe provisions of laws adopted by Member States in implementation of Community measures relating specifically to SEs;\n(ii)\nthe provisions of Member States' laws which would apply to a public limited-liability company formed in accordance with the law of the Member State in which the SE has its registered office;\n(iii)\nthe provisions of its statutes, in the same way as for a public limited-liability company formed in accordance with the law of the Member State in which the SE has its registered office.\n2.   The provisions of laws adopted by Member States specifically for the SE must be in accordance with Directives applicable to public limited-liability companies referred to in Annex I.\n3.   If the nature of the business carried out by an SE is regulated by specific provisions of national laws, those laws shall apply in full to the SE.\nArticle 10\nSubject to this Regulation, an SE shall be treated in every Member State as if it were a public limited-liability company formed in accordance with the law of the Member State in which it has its registered office.\nArticle 11\n1.   The name of an SE shall be preceded or followed by the abbreviation SE.\n2.   Only SEs may include the abbreviation SE in their name.\n3.   Nevertheless, companies, firms and other legal entities registered in a Member State before the date of entry into force of this Regulation in the names of which the abbreviation SE appears shall not be required to alter their names.\nArticle 12\n1.   Every SE shall be registered in the Member State in which it has its registered office in a register designated by the law of that Member State in accordance with Article 3 of the first Council Directive (68/151/EEC) of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community (6).\n2.   An SE may not be registered unless an agreement on arrangements for employee involvement pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2001/86/EC has been concluded, or a decision pursuant to Article 3(6) of the Directive has been taken, or the period for negotiations pursuant to Article 5 of the Directive has expired without an agreement having been concluded.\n3.   In order for an SE to be registered in a Member State which has made use of the option referred to in Article 7(3) of Directive 2001/86/EC, either an agreement pursuant to Article 4 of the Directive must have been concluded on the arrangements for employee involvement, including participation, or none of the participating companies must have been governed by participation rules prior to the registration of the SE.\n4.   The statutes of the SE must not conflict at any time with the arrangements for employee involvement which have been so determined. Where new such arrangements determined pursuant to the Directive conflict with the existing statutes, the statutes shall to the extent necessary be amended.\nIn this case, a Member State may provide that the management organ or the administrative organ of the SE shall be entitled to proceed to amend the statutes without any further decision from the general shareholders meeting.\nArticle 13\nPublication of the documents and particulars concerning an SE which must be publicised under this Regulation shall be effected in the manner laid down in the laws of the Member State in which the SE has its registered office in accordance with Directive 68/151/EEC.\nArticle 14\n1.   Notice of an SE's registration and of the deletion of such a registration shall be published for information purposes in the Official Journal of the European Communities after publication in accordance with Article 13. That notice shall state the name, number, date and place of registration of the SE, the date and place of publication and the title of publication, the registered office of the SE and its sector of activity.\n2.   Where the registered office of an SE is transferred in accordance with Article 8, notice shall be published giving the information provided for in paragraph 1, together with that relating to the new registration.\n3.   The particulars referred to in paragraph 1 shall be forwarded to the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities within one month of the publication referred to in Article 13.\nTITLE II\nFORMATION\nSection 1\nGeneral\nArticle 15\n1.   Subject to this Regulation, the formation of an SE shall be governed by the law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE establishes its registered office.\n2.   The registration of an SE shall be publicised in accordance with Article 13.\nArticle 16\n1.   An SE shall acquire legal personality on the date on which it is registered in the register referred to in Article 12.\n2.   If acts have been performed in an SE's name before its registration in accordance with Article 12 and the SE does not assume the obligations arising out of such acts after its registration, the natural persons, companies, firms or other legal entities which performed those acts shall be jointly and severally liable therefor, without limit, in the absence of agreement to the contrary.\nSection 2\nFormation by merger\nArticle 17\n1.   An SE may be formed by means of a merger in accordance with Article 2(1).\n2.   Such a merger may be carried out in accordance with:\n(a)\nthe procedure for merger by acquisition laid down in Article 3(1) of the third Council Directive (78/855/EEC) of 9 October 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty concerning mergers of public limited-liability companies (7) or\n(b)\nthe procedure for merger by the formation of a new company laid down in Article 4(1) of the said Directive.\nIn the case of a merger by acquisition, the acquiring company shall take the form of an SE when the merger takes place. In the case of a merger by the formation of a new company, the SE shall be the newly formed company.\nArticle 18\nFor matters not covered by this section or, where a matter is partly covered by it, for aspects not covered by it, each company involved in the formation of an SE by merger shall be governed by the provisions of the law of the Member State to which it is subject that apply to mergers of public limited-liability companies in accordance with Directive 78/855/EEC.\nArticle 19\nThe laws of a Member State may provide that a company governed by the law of that Member State may not take part in the formation of an SE by merger if any of that Member State's competent authorities opposes it before the issue of the certificate referred to in Article 25(2).\nSuch opposition may be based only on grounds of public interest. Review by a judicial authority shall be possible.\nArticle 20\n1.   The management or administrative organs of merging companies shall draw up draft terms of merger. The draft terms of merger shall include the following particulars:\n(a)\nthe name and registered office of each of the merging companies together with those proposed for the SE;\n(b)\nthe share-exchange ratio and the amount of any compensation;\n(c)\nthe terms for the allotment of shares in the SE;\n(d)\nthe date from which the holding of shares in the SE will entitle the holders to share in profits and any special conditions affecting that entitlement;\n(e)\nthe date from which the transactions of the merging companies will be treated for accounting purposes as being those of the SE;\n(f)\nthe rights conferred by the SE on the holders of shares to which special rights are attached and on the holders of securities other than shares, or the measures proposed concerning them;\n(g)\nany special advantage granted to the experts who examine the draft terms of merger or to members of the administrative, management, supervisory or controlling organs of the merging companies;\n(h)\nthe statutes of the SE;\n(i)\ninformation on the procedures by which arrangements for employee involvement are determined pursuant to Directive 2001/86/EC.\n2.   The merging companies may include further items in the draft terms of merger.\nArticle 21\nFor each of the merging companies and subject to the additional requirements imposed by the Member State to which the company concerned is subject, the following particulars shall be published in the national gazette of that Member State:\n(a)\nthe type, name and registered office of every merging company;\n(b)\nthe register in which the documents referred to in Article 3(2) of Directive 68/151/EEC are filed in respect of each merging company, and the number of the entry in that register;\n(c)\nan indication of the arrangements made in accordance with Article 24 for the exercise of the rights of the creditors of the company in question and the address at which complete information on those arrangements may be obtained free of charge;\n(d)\nan indication of the arrangements made in accordance with Article 24 for the exercise of the rights of minority shareholders of the company in question and the address at which complete information on those arrangements may be obtained free of charge;\n(e)\nthe name and registered office proposed for the SE.\nArticle 22\nAs an alternative to experts operating on behalf of each of the merging companies, one or more independent experts as defined in Article 10 of Directive 78/855/EEC, appointed for those purposes at the joint request of the companies by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State of one of the merging companies or of the proposed SE, may examine the draft terms of merger and draw up a single report to all the shareholders.\nThe experts shall have the right to request from each of the merging companies any information they consider necessary to enable them to complete their function.\nArticle 23\n1.   The general meeting of each of the merging companies shall approve the draft terms of merger.\n2.   Employee involvement in the SE shall be decided pursuant to Directive 2001/86/EC. The general meetings of each of the merging companies may reserve the right to make registration of the SE conditional upon its express ratification of the arrangements so decided.\nArticle 24\n1.   The law of the Member State governing each merging company shall apply as in the case of a merger of public limited-liability companies, taking into account the cross-border nature of the merger, with regard to the protection of the interests of:\n(a)\ncreditors of the merging companies;\n(b)\nholders of bonds of the merging companies;\n(c)\nholders of securities, other than shares, which carry special rights in the merging companies.\n2.   A Member State may, in the case of the merging companies governed by its law, adopt provisions designed to ensure appropriate protection for minority shareholders who have opposed the merger.\nArticle 25\n1.   The legality of a merger shall be scrutinised, as regards the part of the procedure concerning each merging company, in accordance with the law on mergers of public limited-liability companies of the Member State to which the merging company is subject.\n2.   In each Member State concerned the court, notary or other competent authority shall issue a certificate conclusively attesting to the completion of the pre-merger acts and formalities.\n3.   If the law of a Member State to which a merging company is subject provides for a procedure to scrutinise and amend the share-exchange ratio, or a procedure to compensate minority shareholders, without preventing the registration of the merger, such procedures shall only apply if the other merging companies situated in Member States which do not provide for such procedure explicitly accept, when approving the draft terms of the merger in accordance with Article 23(1), the possibility for the shareholders of that merging company to have recourse to such procedure. In such cases, the court, notary or other competent authorities may issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 even if such a procedure has been commenced. The certificate must, however, indicate that the procedure is pending. The decision in the procedure shall be binding on the acquiring company and all its shareholders.\nArticle 26\n1.   The legality of a merger shall be scrutinised, as regards the part of the procedure concerning the completion of the merger and the formation of the SE, by the court, notary or other authority competent in the Member State of the proposed registered office of the SE to scrutinise that aspect of the legality of mergers of public limited-liability companies.\n2.   To that end each merging company shall submit to the competent authority the certificate referred to in Article 25(2) within six months of its issue together with a copy of the draft terms of merger approved by that company.\n3.   The authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular ensure that the merging companies have approved draft terms of merger in the same terms and that arrangements for employee involvement have been determined pursuant to Directive 2001/86/EC.\n4.   That authority shall also satisfy itself that the SE has been formed in accordance with the requirements of the law of the Member State in which it has its registered office in accordance with Article 15.\nArticle 27\n1.   A merger and the simultaneous formation of an SE shall take effect on the date on which the SE is registered in accordance with Article 12.\n2.   The SE may not be registered until the formalities provided for in Articles 25 and 26 have been completed.\nArticle 28\nFor each of the merging companies the completion of the merger shall be publicised as laid down by the law of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC.\nArticle 29\n1.   A merger carried out as laid down in Article 17(2)(a) shall have the following consequences ipso jure and simultaneously:\n(a)\nall the assets and liabilities of each company being acquired are transferred to the acquiring company;\n(b)\nthe shareholders of the company being acquired become shareholders of the acquiring company;\n(c)\nthe company being acquired ceases to exist;\n(d)\nthe acquiring company adopts the form of an SE.\n2.   A merger carried out as laid down in Article 17(2)(b) shall have the following consequences ipso jure and simultaneously:\n(a)\nall the assets and liabilities of the merging companies are transferred to the SE;\n(b)\nthe shareholders of the merging companies become shareholders of the SE;\n(c)\nthe merging companies cease to exist.\n3.   Where, in the case of a merger of public limited-liability companies, the law of a Member State requires the completion of any special formalities before the transfer of certain assets, rights and obligations by the merging companies becomes effective against third parties, those formalities shall apply and shall be carried out either by the merging companies or by the SE following its registration.\n4.   The rights and obligations of the participating companies on terms and conditions of employment arising from national law, practice and individual employment contracts or employment relationships and existing at the date of the registration shall, by reason of such registration be transferred to the SE upon its registration.\nArticle 30\nA merger as provided for in Article 2(1) may not be declared null and void once the SE has been registered.\nThe absence of scrutiny of the legality of the merger pursuant to Articles 25 and 26 may be included among the grounds for the winding-up of the SE.\nArticle 31\n1.   Where a merger within the meaning of Article 17(2)(a) is carried out by a company which holds all the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote at general meetings of another company, neither Article 20(1)(b), (c) and (d), Article 29(1)(b) nor Article 22 shall apply. National law governing each merging company and mergers of public limited-liability companies in accordance with Article 24 of Directive 78/855/EEC shall nevertheless apply.\n2.   Where a merger by acquisition is carried out by a company which holds 90 % or more but not all of the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote at general meetings of another company, reports by the management or administrative body, reports by an independent expert or experts and the documents necessary for scrutiny shall be required only to the extent that the national law governing either the acquiring company or the company being acquired so requires.\nMember States may, however, provide that this paragraph may apply where a company holds shares conferring 90 % or more but not all of the voting rights.\nSection 3\nFormation of a holding SE\nArticle 32\n1.   A holding SE may be formed in accordance with Article 2(2).\nA company promoting the formation of a holding SE in accordance with Article 2(2) shall continue to exist.\n2.   The management or administrative organs of the companies which promote such an operation shall draw up, in the same terms, draft terms for the formation of the holding SE. The draft terms shall include a report explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects of the formation and indicating the implications for the shareholders and for the employees of the adoption of the form of a holding SE. The draft terms shall also set out the particulars provided for in Article 20(1)(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h) and (i) and shall fix the minimum proportion of the shares in each of the companies promoting the operation which the shareholders must contribute to the formation of the holding SE. That proportion shall be shares conferring more than 50 % of the permanent voting rights.\n3.   For each of the companies promoting the operation, the draft terms for the formation of the holding SE shall be publicised in the manner laid down in each Member State's national law in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC at least one month before the date of the general meeting called to decide thereon.\n4.   One or more experts independent of the companies promoting the operation, appointed or approved by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State to which each company is subject in accordance with national provisions adopted in implementation of Directive 78/855/EEC, shall examine the draft terms of formation drawn up in accordance with paragraph 2 and draw up a written report for the shareholders of each company. By agreement between the companies promoting the operation, a single written report may be drawn up for the shareholders of all the companies by one or more independent experts, appointed or approved by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State to which one of the companies promoting the operation or the proposed SE is subject in accordance with national provisions adopted in implementation of Directive 78/855/EEC.\n5.   The report shall indicate any particular difficulties of valuation and state whether the proposed share-exchange ratio is fair and reasonable, indicating the methods used to arrive at it and whether such methods are adequate in the case in question.\n6.   The general meeting of each company promoting the operation shall approve the draft terms of formation of the holding SE.\nEmployee involvement in the holding SE shall be decided pursuant to Directive 2001/86/EC. The general meetings of each company promoting the operation may reserve the right to make registration of the holding SE conditional upon its express ratification of the arrangements so decided.\n7.   These provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to private limited-liability companies.\nArticle 33\n1.   The shareholders of the companies promoting such an operation shall have a period of three months in which to inform the promoting companies whether they intend to contribute their shares to the formation of the holding SE. That period shall begin on the date upon which the terms for the formation of the holding SE have been finally determined in accordance with Article 32.\n2.   The holding SE shall be formed only if, within the period referred to in paragraph 1, the shareholders of the companies promoting the operation have assigned the minimum proportion of shares in each company in accordance with the draft terms of formation and if all the other conditions are fulfilled.\n3.   If the conditions for the formation of the holding SE are all fulfilled in accordance with paragraph 2, that fact shall, in respect of each of the promoting companies, be publicised in the manner laid down in the national law governing each of those companies adopted in implementation of Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC.\nShareholders of the companies promoting the operation who have not indicated whether they intend to make their shares available to the promoting companies for the purpose of forming the holding SE within the period referred to in paragraph 1 shall have a further month in which to do so.\n4.   Shareholders who have contributed their securities to the formation of the SE shall receive shares in the holding SE.\n5.   The holding SE may not be registered until it is shown that the formalities referred to in Article 32 have been completed and that the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 have been fulfilled.\nArticle 34\nA Member State may, in the case of companies promoting such an operation, adopt provisions designed to ensure protection for minority shareholders who oppose the operation, creditors and employees.\nSection 4\nFormation of a subsidiary SE\nArticle 35\nAn SE may be formed in accordance with Article 2(3).\nArticle 36\nCompanies, firms and other legal entities participating in such an operation shall be subject to the provisions governing their participation in the formation of a subsidiary in the form of a public limited-liability company under national law.\nSection 5\nConversion of an existing public limited-liability company into an SE\nArticle 37\n1.   An SE may be formed in accordance with Article 2(4).\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 12 the conversion of a public limited-liability company into an SE shall not result in the winding up of the company or in the creation of a new legal person.\n3.   The registered office may not be transferred from one Member State to another pursuant to Article 8 at the same time as the conversion is effected.\n4.   The management or administrative organ of the company in question shall draw up draft terms of conversion and a report explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects of the conversion and indicating the implications for the shareholders and for the employees of the adoption of the form of an SE.\n5.   The draft terms of conversion shall be publicised in the manner laid down in each Member State's law in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC at least one month before the general meeting called upon to decide thereon.\n6.   Before the general meeting referred to in paragraph 7 one or more independent experts appointed or approved, in accordance with the national provisions adopted in implementation of Article 10 of Directive 78/855/EEC, by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State to which the company being converted into an SE is subject shall certify in compliance with Directive 77/91/EEC (8)\nmutatis mutandis that the company has net assets at least equivalent to its capital plus those reserves which must not be distributed under the law or the Statutes.\n7.   The general meeting of the company in question shall approve the draft terms of conversion together with the statutes of the SE. The decision of the general meeting shall be passed as laid down in the provisions of national law adopted in implementation of Article 7 of Directive 78/855/EEC.\n8.   Member States may condition a conversion to a favourable vote of a qualified majority or unanimity in the organ of the company to be converted within which employee participation is organised.\n9.   The rights and obligations of the company to be converted on terms and conditions of employment arising from national law, practice and individual employment contracts or employment relationships and existing at the date of the registration shall, by reason of such registration be transferred to the SE.\nTITLE III\nSTRUCTURE OF THE SE\nArticle 38\nUnder the conditions laid down by this Regulation an SE shall comprise:\n(a)\na general meeting of shareholders and\n(b)\neither a supervisory organ and a management organ (two-tier system) or an administrative organ (one-tier system) depending on the form adopted in the statutes.\nSection 1\nTwo-tier system\nArticle 39\n1.   The management organ shall be responsible for managing the SE. A Member State may provide that a managing director or managing directors shall be responsible for the current management under the same conditions as for public limited-liability companies that have registered offices within that Member State's territory.\n2.   The member or members of the management organ shall be appointed and removed by the supervisory organ.\nA Member State may, however, require or permit the statutes to provide that the member or members of the management organ shall be appointed and removed by the general meeting under the same conditions as for public limited-liability companies that have registered offices within its territory.\n3.   No person may at the same time be a member of both the management organ and the supervisory organ of the same SE. The supervisory organ may, however, nominate one of its members to act as a member of the management organ in the event of a vacancy. During such a period the functions of the person concerned as a member of the supervisory organ shall be suspended. A Member State may impose a time limit on such a period.\n4.   The number of members of the management organ or the rules for determining it shall be laid down in the SE's statutes. A Member State may, however, fix a minimum and/or a maximum number.\n5.   Where no provision is made for a two-tier system in relation to public limited-liability companies with registered offices within its territory, a Member State may adopt the appropriate measures in relation to SEs.\nArticle 40\n1.   The supervisory organ shall supervise the work of the management organ. It may not itself exercise the power to manage the SE.\n2.   The members of the supervisory organ shall be appointed by the general meeting. The members of the first supervisory organ may, however, be appointed by the statutes. This shall apply without prejudice to Article 47(4) or to any employee participation arrangements determined pursuant to Directive 2001/86/EC.\n3.   The number of members of the supervisory organ or the rules for determining it shall be laid down in the statutes. A Member State may, however, stipulate the number of members of the supervisory organ for SEs registered within its territory or a minimum and/or a maximum number.\nArticle 41\n1.   The management organ shall report to the supervisory organ at least once every three months on the progress and foreseeable development of the SE's business.\n2.   In addition to the regular information referred to in paragraph 1, the management organ shall promptly pass the supervisory organ any information on events likely to have an appreciable effect on the SE.\n3.   The supervisory organ may require the management organ to provide information of any kind which it needs to exercise supervision in accordance with Article 40(1). A Member State may provide that each member of the supervisory organ also be entitled to this facility.\n4.   The supervisory organ may undertake or arrange for any investigations necessary for the performance of its duties.\n5.   Each member of the supervisory organ shall be entitled to examine all information submitted to it.\nArticle 42\nThe supervisory organ shall elect a chairman from among its members. If half of the members are appointed by employees, only a member appointed by the general meeting of shareholders may be elected chairman.\nSection 2\nThe one-tier system\nArticle 43\n1.   The administrative organ shall manage the SE. A Member State may provide that a managing director or managing directors shall be responsible for the day-to-day management under the same conditions as for public limited-liability companies that have registered offices within that Member State's territory.\n2.   The number of members of the administrative organ or the rules for determining it shall be laid down in the SE's statutes. A Member State may, however, set a minimum and, where necessary, a maximum number of members.\nThe administrative organ shall, however, consist of at least three members where employee participation is regulated in accordance with Directive 2001/86/EC.\n3.   The member or members of the administrative organ shall be appointed by the general meeting. The members of the first administrative organ may, however, be appointed by the statutes. This shall apply without prejudice to Article 47(4) or to any employee participation arrangements determined pursuant to Directive 2001/86/EC.\n4.   Where no provision is made for a one-tier system in relation to public limited-liability companies with registered offices within its territory, a Member State may adopt the appropriate measures in relation to SEs.\nArticle 44\n1.   The administrative organ shall meet at least once every three months at intervals laid down by the statutes to discuss the progress and foreseeable development of the SE's business.\n2.   Each member of the administrative organ shall be entitled to examine all information submitted to it.\nArticle 45\nThe administrative organ shall elect a chairman from among its members. If half of the members are appointed by employees, only a member appointed by the general meeting of shareholders may be elected chairman.\nSection 3\nRules common to the one-tier and two-tier systems\nArticle 46\n1.   Members of company organs shall be appointed for a period laid down in the statutes not exceeding six years.\n2.   Subject to any restrictions laid down in the statutes, members may be reappointed once or more than once for the period determined in accordance with paragraph 1.\nArticle 47\n1.   An SE's statutes may permit a company or other legal entity to be a member of one of its organs, provided that the law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated does not provide otherwise.\nThat company or other legal entity shall designate a natural person to exercise its functions on the organ in question.\n2.   No person may be a member of any SE organ or a representative of a member within the meaning of paragraph 1 who:\n(a)\nis disqualified, under the law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated, from serving on the corresponding organ of a public limited-liability company governed by the law of that Member State, or\n(b)\nis disqualified from serving on the corresponding organ of a public limited-liability company governed by the law of a Member State owing to a judicial or administrative decision delivered in a Member State.\n3.   An SE's statutes may, in accordance with the law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated, lay down special conditions of eligibility for members representing the shareholders.\n4.   This Regulation shall not affect national law permitting a minority of shareholders or other persons or authorities to appoint some of the members of a company organ.\nArticle 48\n1.   An SE's statutes shall list the categories of transactions which require authorisation of the management organ by the supervisory organ in the two-tier system or an express decision by the administrative organ in the one-tier system.\nA Member State may, however, provide that in the two-tier system the supervisory organ may itself make certain categories of transactions subject to authorisation.\n2.   A Member State may determine the categories of transactions which must at least be indicated in the statutes of SEs registered within its territory.\nArticle 49\nThe members of an SE's organs shall be under a duty, even after they have ceased to hold office, not to divulge any information which they have concerning the SE the disclosure of which might be prejudicial to the company's interests, except where such disclosure is required or permitted under national law provisions applicable to public limited-liability companies or is in the public interest.\nArticle 50\n1.   Unless otherwise provided by this Regulation or the statutes, the internal rules relating to quorums and decision-taking in SE organs shall be as follows:\n(a)\nquorum: at least half of the members must be present or represented;\n(b)\ndecision-taking: a majority of the members present or represented.\n2.   Where there is no relevant provision in the statutes, the chairman of each organ shall have a casting vote in the event of a tie. There shall be no provision to the contrary in the statutes, however, where half of the supervisory organ consists of employees' representatives.\n3.   Where employee participation is provided for in accordance with Directive 2001/86/EC, a Member State may provide that the supervisory organ's quorum and decision-making shall, by way of derogation from the provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, be subject to the rules applicable, under the same conditions, to public limited-liability companies governed by the law of the Member State concerned.\nArticle 51\nMembers of an SE's management, supervisory and administrative organs shall be liable, in accordance with the provisions applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated, for loss or damage sustained by the SE following any breach on their part of the legal, statutory or other obligations inherent in their duties.\nSection 4\nGeneral meeting\nArticle 52\nThe general meeting shall decide on matters for which it is given sole responsibility by:\n(a)\nthis Regulation or\n(b)\nthe legislation of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated adopted in implementation of Directive 2001/86/EC.\nFurthermore, the general meeting shall decide on matters for which responsibility is given to the general meeting of a public limited-liability company governed by the law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated, either by the law of that Member State or by the SE's statutes in accordance with that law.\nArticle 53\nWithout prejudice to the rules laid down in this section, the organisation and conduct of general meetings together with voting procedures shall be governed by the law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated.\nArticle 54\n1.   An SE shall hold a general meeting at least once each calendar year, within six months of the end of its financial year, unless the law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated applicable to public limited-liability companies carrying on the same type of activity as the SE provides for more frequent meetings. A Member State may, however, provide that the first general meeting may be held at any time in the 18 months following an SE's incorporation.\n2.   General meetings may be convened at any time by the management organ, the administrative organ, the supervisory organ or any other organ or competent authority in accordance with the national law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated.\nArticle 55\n1.   One or more shareholders who together hold at least 10 % of an SE's subscribed capital may request the SE to convene a general meeting and draw up the agenda therefor; the SE's statutes or national legislation may provide for a smaller proportion under the same conditions as those applicable to public limited-liability companies.\n2.   The request that a general meeting be convened shall state the items to be put on the agenda.\n3.   If, following a request made under paragraph 1, a general meeting is not held in due time and, in any event, within two months, the competent judicial or administrative authority within the jurisdiction of which the SE's registered office is situated may order that a general meeting be convened within a given period or authorise either the shareholders who have requested it or their representatives to convene a general meeting. This shall be without prejudice to any national provisions which allow the shareholders themselves to convene general meetings.\nArticle 56\nOne or more shareholders who together hold at least 10 % of an SE's subscribed capital may request that one or more additional items be put on the agenda of any general meeting. The procedures and time limits applicable to such requests shall be laid down by the national law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated or, failing that, by the SE's statutes. The above proportion may be reduced by the statutes or by the law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated under the same conditions as are applicable to public limited-liability companies.\nArticle 57\nSave where this Regulation or, failing that, the law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which an SE's registered office is situated requires a larger majority, the general meeting's decisions shall be taken by a majority of the votes validly cast.\nArticle 58\nThe votes cast shall not include votes attaching to shares in respect of which the shareholder has not taken part in the vote or has abstained or has returned a blank or spoilt ballot paper.\nArticle 59\n1.   Amendment of an SE's statutes shall require a decision by the general meeting taken by a majority which may not be less than two thirds of the votes cast, unless the law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which an SE's registered office is situated requires or permits a larger majority.\n2.   A Member State may, however, provide that where at least half of an SE's subscribed capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes referred to in paragraph 1 shall suffice.\n3.   Amendments to an SE's statutes shall be publicised in accordance with Article 13.\nArticle 60\n1.   Where an SE has two or more classes of shares, every decision by the general meeting shall be subject to a separate vote by each class of shareholders whose class rights are affected thereby.\n2.   Where a decision by the general meeting requires the majority of votes specified in Article 59(1) or (2), that majority shall also be required for the separate vote by each class of shareholders whose class rights are affected by the decision.\nTITLE IV\nANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS\nArticle 61\nSubject to Article 62 an SE shall be governed by the rules applicable to public limited-liability companies under the law of the Member State in which its registered office is situated as regards the preparation of its annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts including the accompanying annual report and the auditing and publication of those accounts.\nArticle 62\n1.   An SE which is a credit or financial institution shall be governed by the rules laid down in the national law of the Member State in which its registered office is situated in implementation of Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (9) as regards the preparation of its annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts, including the accompanying annual report and the auditing and publication of those accounts.\n2.   An SE which is an insurance undertaking shall be governed by the rules laid down in the national law of the Member State in which its registered office is situated in implementation of Council Directive 91/674/EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings (10) as regards the preparation of its annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts including the accompanying annual report and the auditing and publication of those accounts.\nTITLE V\nWINDING UP, LIQUIDATION, INSOLVENCY AND CESSATION OF PAYMENTS\nArticle 63\nAs regards winding up, liquidation, insolvency, cessation of payments and similar procedures, an SE shall be governed by the legal provisions which would apply to a public limited-liability company formed in accordance with the law of the Member State in which its registered office is situated, including provisions relating to decision-making by the general meeting.\nArticle 64\n1.   When an SE no longer complies with the requirement laid down in Article 7, the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated shall take appropriate measures to oblige the SE to regularise its position within a specified period either:\n(a)\nby re-establishing its head office in the Member State in which its registered office is situated or\n(b)\nby transferring the registered office by means of the procedure laid down in Article 8.\n2.   The Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated shall put in place the measures necessary to ensure that an SE which fails to regularise its position in accordance with paragraph 1 is liquidated.\n3.   The Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated shall set up a judicial remedy with regard to any established infringement of Article 7. That remedy shall have a suspensory effect on the procedures laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.   Where it is established on the initiative of either the authorities or any interested party that an SE has its head office within the territory of a Member State in breach of Article 7, the authorities of that Member State shall immediately inform the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated.\nArticle 65\nWithout prejudice to provisions of national law requiring additional publication, the initiation and termination of winding up, liquidation, insolvency or cessation of payment procedures and any decision to continue operating shall be publicised in accordance with Article 13.\nArticle 66\n1.   An SE may be converted into a public limited-liability company governed by the law of the Member State in which its registered office is situated. No decision on conversion may be taken before two years have elapsed since its registration or before the first two sets of annual accounts have been approved.\n2.   The conversion of an SE into a public limited-liability company shall not result in the winding up of the company or in the creation of a new legal person.\n3.   The management or administrative organ of the SE shall draw up draft terms of conversion and a report explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects of the conversion and indicating the implications of the adoption of the public limited-liability company for the shareholders and for the employees.\n4.   The draft terms of conversion shall be publicised in the manner laid down in each Member State's law in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC at least one month before the general meeting called to decide thereon.\n5.   Before the general meeting referred to in paragraph 6, one or more independent experts appointed or approved, in accordance with the national provisions adopted in implementation of Article 10 of Directive 78/855/EEC, by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State to which the SE being converted into a public limited-liability company is subject shall certify that the company has assets at least equivalent to its capital.\n6.   The general meeting of the SE shall approve the draft terms of conversion together with the statutes of the public limited-liability company. The decision of the general meeting shall be passed as laid down in the provisions of national law adopted in implementation of Article 7 of Directive 78/855/EEC.\nTITLE VI\nADDITIONAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 67\n1.   If and so long as the third phase of economic and monetary union (EMU) does not apply to it each Member State may make SEs with registered offices within its territory subject to the same provisions as apply to public limited-liability companies covered by its legislation as regards the expression of their capital. An SE may, in any case, express its capital in euro as well. In that event the national currency/euro conversion rate shall be that for the last day of the month preceding that of the formation of the SE.\n2.   If and so long as the third phase of EMU does not apply to the Member State in which an SE has its registered office, the SE may, however, prepare and publish its annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts in euro. The Member State may require that the SE's annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts be prepared and published in the national currency under the same conditions as those laid down for public limited-liability companies governed by the law of that Member State. This shall not prejudge the additional possibility for an SE of publishing its annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts in euro in accordance with Council Directive 90/604/EEC of 8 November 1990 amending Directive 78/60/EEC on annual accounts and Directive 83/349/EEC on consolidated accounts as concerns the exemptions for small and medium-sized companies and the publication of accounts in ecu (11).\nTITLE VII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 68\n1.   The Member States shall make such provision as is appropriate to ensure the effective application of this Regulation.\n2.   Each Member State shall designate the competent authorities within the meaning of Articles 8, 25, 26, 54, 55 and 64. It shall inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.\nArticle 69\nFive years at the latest after the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall forward to the Council and the European Parliament a report on the application of the Regulation and proposals for amendments, where appropriate. The report shall, in particular, analyse the appropriateness of:\n(a)\nallowing the location of an SE's head office and registered office in different Member States;\n(b)\nbroadening the concept of merger in Article 17(2) in order to admit also other types of merger than those defined in Articles 3(1) and 4(1) of Directive 78/855/EEC;\n(c)\nrevising the jurisdiction clause in Article 8(16) in the light of any provision which may have been inserted in the 1968 Brussels Convention or in any text adopted by Member States or by the Council to replace such Convention;\n(d)\nallowing provisions in the statutes of an SE adopted by a Member State in execution of authorisations given to the Member States by this Regulation or laws adopted to ensure the effective application of this Regulation in respect to the SE which deviate from or are complementary to these laws, even when such provisions would not be authorised in the statutes of a public limited-liability company having its registered office in the Member State.\nArticle 70\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 8 October 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 8 October 2001.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.

It creates a single legal framework within which companies from different EU countries are able to plan and carry out the reorganisation of their business on an EU-wide scale as well as in countries belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA).\nThe directive supplements the regulation. This is to ensure that establishing an SE does not result in the disappearance or reduction of practices of employee involvement existing within the companies participating in establishing that SE, given the diverse rules and practices across EU countries as to how employees’ representatives are involved in company decision-making.\nThe annexes to the regulation have been amended several times to take into account the changes in national equivalents to public limited-liability companies, as well as additional countries joining the EU. In 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/699, which introduced temporary measures concerning the general meetings of SEs.\nKEY POINTS\nRegulation (EC) No 2157/2001\nCombined application of the SE regulation and national law\nAn SE with its registered office in an EU country is governed:\nby the rules contained in the regulation; and\nfor those aspects not covered by the regulation, by the national rules adopted to apply EU measures targeting the SE specifically and those that apply to public limited-liability companies — as a general rule, winding-up, liquidation, insolvency and suspension of payments are in large measure governed by the applicable national law.\nRules for establishing an SE\nAn SE is established with at least 2 companies originating in different EEA countries, which means that it can only be created from an existing base. It must have a minimum capital of €120,000 and can be created in the following ways.\nType of constitution\nType of company\nCriteria to be met\nMerger (to establish an SE)\nPublic limited-liability companies\nAt least 2 of the companies must originate in different EEA countries\nEstablishment of a European holding company\nPublic or private limited-liability companies\nAt least 2 of the companies must originate in different EEA countries or they must have had a subsidiary or branch in another EU country for at least 2 years\nEstablishment of a European subsidiary\nCompanies, firms or other legal entities\nAt least 2 of the entities must originate in different EEA countries or must have had a subsidiary or branch in another EU country for at least 2 years\nConversion\nPublic limited-liability companies\nThe company must have had a subsidiary in another EEA country for at least 2 years\nAn SE:\ncan create 1 (or more) subsidiaries that are also SEs;\nmust have its registered office in the country where it has its head office;\ncan transfer its registered office within the EEA without having to dissolve the original company to form a new one.\nThe registration and completion of liquidation of an SE is published for information in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2 possible organisation structures\nThe SE’s statutes can relate to 2 different organisational systems:\nthe two-tier system, where company management consists of a management board and a supervisory board; and\nthe one-tier system, where company management consists of an administrative board.\nLack of tax harmonisation\nThe SEs are subject to taxes and charges in all EEA countries according to rules applicable in those countries.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2020/699 introduces a temporary exception to the rules governing SEs (and European cooperative societies (SCEs), created under Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003). Since COVID-19 confinement and social-distancing measures make it difficult for SEs and SCEs to organise their general meetings within 6 months of the end of their financial year, as is legally required, this temporary measure allows SEs and SCEs to hold their general meetings within 12 months of the end of the financial year, but no later than 31 December 2020.\nDirective 2001/86/EC\nEmployee involvement in the SE\nThe management and the employees' representatives must decide on the employee involvement in the SE before the SE is registered.\nThis agreement must include information and consultation procedures and, where appropriate, employee involvement in the management bodies of the SE.\nThis involvement is nevertheless only mandatory if the employees already benefited from it before the creation of the SE.\nWhere the 2 parties are unable to reach a satisfactory arrangement, a series of standard principles listed in the annex to the directive then apply.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATION AND DIRECTIVE APPLY?\nThe regulation has applied since 8 October 2004.\nThe directive has applied since 10 November 2001 and had to become law in the EU countries by 8 October 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nCompany law and corporate governance (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (OJ L 294, 10.11.2001, pp. 1-21)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 have been incorporated into the original text.
