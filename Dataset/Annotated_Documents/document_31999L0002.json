whereas the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured; whereas this is not the case at present because of the differences in treatment in the Member States, irradiation of foodstuffs being allowed in some and banned in others;(3) Whereas this framework Directive will be completed by Directive 1999/3/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 on the establishment of a Community list of foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation (4), hereinafter referred to as 'the implementing Directive`;(4) Whereas in several Member States foodstuff irradiation constitutes a sensitive issue in public debate, and whereas consumers may have cause for concern about the consequences of the use of food irradiation;(5) Whereas, until the entry into force of the Community positive list of foodstuffs which may be treated with ionising radiation, it is appropriate that Member States may, in compliance with the rules of the Treaty, continue to apply existing national restrictions or bans on ionising radiation of foodstuffs and on trade in irradiated foodstuffs which are not included in the initial positive list established by the implementing Directive;(6) Whereas rules relating to the use of ionising radiation for the treatment of foodstuffs should take account primarily of human health requirements but also, within the limits required for the protection of health, of economic and technical needs;(7) Whereas Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation (5) is applicable;(8) Whereas approved irradiation units should be subject to an official control, through an inspection system to be created for the needs of this Directive;(9) Whereas approved units should keep records to ensure that the rules of this Directive have been respected;(10) Whereas Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (6) has already laid down rules concerning the labelling of irradiated foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer;(11) Whereas appropriate rules must also be laid down for the labelling of foodstuffs treated with ionising radiation not intended for the ultimate consumer;(12) Whereas, without prejudice to the decision-making procedures laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community or in this Directive, the Scientific Committee for Food set up by Decision 74/234/EEC (7) should be consulted on any question relating to this Directive which may have an effect on public health;(13) Whereas foodstuffs may only be treated by the action of ionising radiation if there is a food hygiene need, or a demonstrable technological or other advantage, or benefit to the consumer and if they are wholesome and in a proper condition, since ionising radiation should not be used as a substitute for hygiene or health practices or good manufacturing or agricultural practice;(14) Whereas the process should not be used as a substitute for good manufacturing practice, and whereas this condition is fulfilled for foodstuffs listed in the Annex to the implementing Directive;(15) Whereas, in all cases where the Council empowers the Commission to implement rules relating to food irradiation, provision should be made for a procedure instituting close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, and, where necessary, the Standing Veterinary Committee or the Standing Committee on Plant Health;(16) Whereas should the use of the process or of a foodstuff treated with ionising radiation authorised on the basis of this Directive appear to constitute a health risk, Member States should be authorised to suspend or limit such use, or to reduce the limits, pending a decision at Community level;(17) Whereas Council Directive 89/397/EEC of 14 June 1989 on the official control of foodstuffs (8) leaves the choice of means and methods to the national enforcement authorities; whereas Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs (9) lays down quality standards for laboratories and requires the use of validated methods of analysis where available; whereas Article 5 of the latter Directive is applicable to the monitoring of the implementation of this Directive;(18) Whereas a modus vivendi between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concerning the implementing measures for acts adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (10) was concluded on 20 December 1994,HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1 1.

Food irradiation may be authorised only if:- there is a reasonable technological need,- it presents no health hazard and is carried out under the conditions proposed,- it is of benefit to the consumer,- it is not used as a substitute for hygiene and health practices or for good manufacturing or agricultural practice.2. Food irradiation may be used only for the following purposes:- to reduce the incidence of food-borne disease by destroying pathogenic organisms,- to reduce spoilage of foodstuffs by retarding or arresting decay processes and destroying spoilage organisms,- to reduce loss of foodstuffs by premature ripening, germination or sprouting,- to rid foodstuffs of organisms harmful to plant or plant products.ANNEX II SOURCES OF IONISING RADIATION Foodstuffs may be treated only by the following sources of ionising radiation:(a) gamma rays from radionuclides 60Co or 137Cs;(b) X-rays generated from machine sources operated at or below a nominal energy (maximum quantum energy) level of 5 MeV;(c) electrons generated from machine sources operated at or below a nominal energy (maximum quantum energy) level of 10 MeV.ANNEX III 1. DOSIMETRY Overall average absorbed dose It can be assumed for the purpose of the determination of the wholesomeness of foodstuffs treated with an overall average dose of 10 kGy or less that all radiation chemical effects in that particular dose range are proportional to the dose.The overall average dose, >START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC>, is defined by the following integral over the total volume of the goods:>START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC> = >NUM>1>DEN>M &int; p (x,y,z) d (x,y,z) dVwhere >TABLE>The overall average absorbed dose can be determined directly for homogenous products or for bulk goods of homogenous apparent density by distributing an adequate number of dosimeters strategically and at random throughout the volume of the goods. From the dose distribution determined in this manner an average can be calculated which is the overall average absorbed dose.If the shape of the dose distribution curve through the product is well determined, the positions of minimum and maximum dose are known. Measurements of the distribution of dose in these two positions in a series of samples of the product can be used to give an estimate of the overall average dose.In some cases, the mean value of the average values of the minimum dose (>START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC>min) and maximum dose (>START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC>max) will be a good estimate of the overall dose: i.e., in these cases:overall average dose &ap; >NUM\"START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC>max + >START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC>min>DEN>2The ratio of >NUM\"START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC>max>DEN\"START OF GRAPHIC> FD>END OF GRAPHIC>min should not exceed 3.2. PROCEDURES 2.1. Before routine irradiation of a given category of foodstuff begins at a radiation facility, the locations of the minimum and maximum doses are determined by making dose measurements throughout the product volume. These validation measurements must be carried out a suitable number of times (e.g. 3-5) in order to make allowance for variations in product density or geometry.2.2. Measurements must be repeated whenever the product, its geometry or the irradiation conditions are changed.2.3. During the process, routine dose measurements are carried out in order to ensure that the dose limits are not exceeded. Measurements should be carried out by placing dosimeters at the positions of the maximum or minimum dose, or at a reference position. The dose at the reference position must be quantitatively linked to the maximum and minimum dose. The reference position should be located at a convenient point in or on the product, where dose variations are low.2.4. Routine dose measurements must be carried out on each batch and at regular intervals during production.2.5. In cases where flowing, non-packaged goods are irradiated, the locations of the minimum and maximum doses cannot be determined. In such a case it is preferable to use random dosimeter sampling to ascertain the values of these dose extremes.2.6. Dose measurements should be carried out by using recognised dosimetry systems, and the measurements should be traceable to primary standards.2.7. During irradiation, certain facility parameters must be controlled and continuously recorded. For radionuclide facilities the parameters include product transport speed or time spent in the radiation zone and positive indication for correct position of the source. For accelerator facilities, the parameters include product transport speed and energy level, electron current and scanner width of the facility.STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION Recital 17 The Commission stresses that, once the new decision on the reform of the committee procedure has been adopted, it will propose to the legislator that the provisions governing committees in all previous acts should be adjusted to bring them into line with the new 'committee procedure` decision. The Commission undertakes to apply in full any interinstitutional agreement deriving from this new decision.STATEMENT BY THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION Article 7(3) third indent With the objective of ensuring that such methods exist for all products, the Commission and the Member States will encourage the further development of standardised or validated methods of analysis, which aim to verify whether foodstuffs have been treated by ionising radiation. The Commission confirms that the annual report referred to in Article 7(4) will include information on such developments. It will include in its annual report for the year 2001 a review of the application of these provisions to determine whether any problems have arisen with the use of validated or standardised methods. The Commission will, where appropriate and in accordance with the decision-making procedures defined in the Treaties or in this Directive, take steps to deal with these problems and those that are likely to arise. This information shall also be made available to the European Parliament.", "summary": "Foodstuffs treated with ionising radiation\nFoodstuffs treated with ionising radiation\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 1999/2/EC on  the irradiation of foods and food ingredients\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt sets out the conditions for manufacturing, marketing, importing and compulsory labelling of foods treated with ionising radiation, a process used to reduce the number of pathogenic micro-organisms in food and to increase its shelf life.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe directive does not apply to:\nfoods exposed to ionising radiation from measuring or inspection devices, within specified limits;\nfoods which are prepared for patients requiring sterile diets under medical supervision.\nThe annex of Directive 1999/3/EC, an implementing directive, provides an initial list of foods that may be irradiated, i.e. dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings.\nAuthorisations and approved facilities\nFoods may only be irradiated in facilities approved by EU countries’ authorities. Once facilities are approved, EU countries then provide a list of them to the European Commission. The Commission publishes the list of approved facilities.\nDecision 2002/840/EC allows foods to be irradiated in non-EU countries and then to be imported into the EU, so long as they meet EU rules and are irradiated in an approved facility, as listed in the annex to the Decision.\nRegistration\nIrradiation facilities must keep records for each source of ionising radiation showing the information specified (i.e. the nature and quantity of foodstuffs irradiated, data for control of the irradiation process, etc.).\nThese records must be kept for 5 years. Detailed rules on keeping the register are adopted by the Commission, assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (PAFF).\nApplication to place irradiated foods on the market\nIrradiated foodstuffs may be placed on the EU market only if they comply with the directive, which specifies:\nthe conditions for authorising food irradiation (technological need, benefit to the consumer, etc.) and permissible purposes (to reduce the incidence of disease, rid foodstuffs of harmful organisms);\nthe foodstuffs must be in a wholesome state and irradiation must not be used to replace hygiene measures;\nirradiation may be combined with other chemical treatment, but only if that treatment is for different purposes;\nthe sources of ionising radiation (gamma rays, X rays and electrons of certain characteristics);\nthe dosimetry (the determination of the overall average absorbed dose and procedures for measuring it). The directive also specifies that the maximum radiation dose for foodstuffs may be given in partial doses.\nLabelling and packagingThe words ‘irradiated’ or ‘treated with ionising radiation’ must appear:\non the label or packaging;\non the documents which accompany irradiated foodstuffs or foodstuffs containing irradiated ingredients.\nProducts intended for sale to the final consumer must meet the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on food information to be given to consumers.\nProducts not intended for sale to the final consumer must be marked to indicate that they have been irradiated and the name and address of the facility where this was carried out.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 20 March 1999. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 20 September 2000 (rules to permit the marketing and use of irradiated foodstuffs) and 20 March 2001 (rules to prohibit the marketing and use of irradiated food not complying with this directive).\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFood irradiation (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 1999/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation (OJ L 66, 13.3.1999, pp. 16–23)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 1999/2/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
