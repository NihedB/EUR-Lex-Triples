This Directive is a specific Directive within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC.  2. This Directive concerns the presence of vinyl chloride monomer in, and possible migration from, materials and articles prepared with vinyl chloride polymers or copolymers, hereinafter called \"materials and articles\", which in their finished state are intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, or which are in contact with foodstuffs and are intended for that purpose.   Article 2 1. Materials and articles must not contain vinyl chloride monomer in a quantity exceeding that laid down in Annex I.  2. Materials and articles must not pass on to foodstuffs which are in or have been brought into contact with such materials and articles any vinyl chloride detectable by the method which complies with the criteria laid down in Annex II.  (1)OJ No L 340, 9.12.1976, p. 19. (2)OJ No C 118, 16.5.1977, p. 70. (3)OJ No C 114, 11.5.1977, p. 13.     Article 3 The method of analysis necessary for checking compliance with Article 2 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 of Directive 76/893/EEC and shall comply with the criteria laid down in Annex II.   Article 4 The Council shall review this Directive on the basis of reports from the Commission drawn up in the light of scientific and technical knowledge becoming available after adoption of the Directive and accompanied, where appropriate, by suitable proposals. The first report from the Commission shall be forwarded to the Council not later than 1 January 1979.   Article 5 This Directive shall not affect national provisions relating to other possible rules provided for in Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC or the options afforded to Member States under Article 7 (4) and (5) of that Directive.   Article 6 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions needed in order to comply with this Directive not later than 26 November 1979. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.  2. Member States may defer the introduction of Article 2 (2) and Annex II until such time as a Community method of analysis, as required by Article 3, has been adopted.   Article 7 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.     Done at Brussels, 30 January 1978.  For the Council  The President  P. DALSAGER   ANNEX I Maximum vinyl chloride monomer level in materials and articles  One milligram per kilogram in the final product.   ANNEX II Criteria applicable to the method of determining the level of vinyl chloride in materials and articles and of determining vinyl chloride released by materials and articles    1. The level of vinyl chloride in materials and articles and the level of vinyl chloride released by materials and articles to foodstuffs are determined by means of gas-phase chromatography using the \"headspace\" method.       2. For the purposes of determining vinyl chloride released by materials and articles to foodstuffs, the detection limit shall be 0 701 mg/kg.       3. Vinyl chloride released by materials and articles to foodstuffs is in principle determined in the foodstuffs. When the determination in certain foodstuffs is shown to be impossible for technical reasons, Member States may permit determination by simulants for these particular foodstuffs.", "summary": "Materials and articles containing vinyl chloride monomer\nMaterials and articles containing vinyl chloride monomer\nThis Directive limits the presence and migration of vinyl chloride monomer in and from materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.\nACT\nCouncil Directive 78/142/EEC of 30 January 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to materials and articles which contain vinyl chloride monomer and are intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.\nSUMMARY\nMaterials and articles which are intended to come into contact with foodstuffs may not transfer certain constituents to these materials and articles in quantities liable to endanger human health.\nIn order to guarantee that these foodstuffs contain no trace of vinyl chloride monomer detectable by a method by a general Community method of analysis, materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs must comply with this Directive.
