The ecodesign working plan identifies the energy-related product groups to be considered as priorities for the undertaking of preparatory studies and eventual adoption of implementing measures, as well as the review of Commission Regulation (EC) No 278/2009 (3).\n(3)\nMeasures from the ecodesign working plan have an estimated potential to deliver by 2030 annual final energy savings in excess of 260 TWh, which is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 100 million tonnes. External power supplies are one of the product groups listed in the working plan.\n(4)\nThe Commission established ecodesign requirements for external power supplies in Regulation (EC) No 278/2009. Pursuant to this Regulation the Commission should review it in the light of technological progress.\n(5)\nThe Commission has reviewed Regulation (EC) No 278/2009 and analysed the technical, environmental and economic aspects of external power supplies as well as real-life user behaviour. The review was carried out in close cooperation with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and third countries. The results of the review were made public and presented to the Consultation Forum established by Article 18 of Directive 2009/125/EC.\n(6)\nThe review study shows that external power supplies are placed on the Union market in large quantities, and outlines the benefits of updating the ecodesign requirements and adapting them to technological progress.\n(7)\nMultiple voltage output external power supplies, which are not covered by Regulation (EC) No 278/2009, are being placed on the Union market in increasing numbers. They should therefore be included in the scope of the Regulation to ensure further energy savings and provide a level playing field.\n(8)\nIt is appropriate for external power supplies that adapt their output voltage to the primary load to continue to be included in the scope of the Regulation.\n(9)\nEcodesign requirements should harmonise the energy consumption of external power supplies, thus contributing to the functioning of the internal market. They should also improve the environmental performance of external power supplies. Potential annual final energy savings of 4,3 TWh by 2030, corresponding to 1,45 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, were estimated compared with the situation where no further measures are taken.\n(10)\nThe relevant product parameters should be measured using reliable, accurate and reproducible methods. Those methods should take into account recognised state-of-the-art measurement methods including, where available, harmonised standards adopted by the European standardisation organisations, as listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).\n(11)\nIn accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2009/125/EC, this Regulation should specify the applicable conformity assessment procedures.\n(12)\nTo facilitate compliance checks, manufacturers, importers or authorised representatives should provide information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V to Directive 2009/125/EC in so far as that information relates to the requirements laid down in this Regulation.\n(13)\nIn addition to the legally binding requirements laid down in this Regulation, benchmarks for best available technologies should be identified to make information on products’ environmental performance over their life cycle subject to this Regulation widely available and easily accessible, in accordance with Directive 2009/125/EC, Annex I, part 3, point 2.\n(14)\nA review of this Regulation should assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of its provisions in achieving its goals. The timing of the review should be sufficient for all provisions to be implemented and show an effect on the market.\n(15)\nRegulation (EC) No 278/2009 should therefore be repealed.\n(16)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.
