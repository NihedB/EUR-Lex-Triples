This means they can rely on common legal rules when dealing with countries outside the EU who are parties to the Convention, to protect children involved in international disputes.\nKEY POINTS\nThe Convention was concluded under the Hague Conference on Private International Law.\nIt covers jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility.\nWhat is covered?\nThe convention seeks to give international protection to children of up to 18 years old, by establishing:\nwhich country has jurisdiction to take measures to protect a child or their property;\nwhich law is applicable for exercising this jurisdiction;\nwhich law applies to parental responsibility;\nthat the protection measures are recognised and enforced in all signatory countries;\ncooperation between signatory countries.\nThe measures aimed at protecting a child relate to:\nparental responsibility;\ncustody rights;\nguardianship;\nhow the child is represented;\nplacement of the child in foster or other care;\nsupervision of that care;\nhow the child’s property is managed.\nWhich country is responsible?\nThe country with jurisdiction to provide protection measures is generally the country where the child is usually resident.\nIt is the country where they are present:\nfor refugees or internationally displaced children;\nfor children whose usual country of residence cannot be established;\nin emergencies (optional).\nException\nIn a particular case, if another country appears to be better placed for assessing the best interests of the child, it may be allowed to assume jurisdiction.\nWhich law applies?\nThe country exercising jurisdiction does so under its own law.\nExceptionally, it may apply or take into consideration the law of another country that is closely connected to the situation – if this is in the best interest of the child.\nA country can only refuse to apply the law designated by the convention for justified reasons of public policy and in the best interest of the child.\nRecognition & enforcement\nThe measures a signatory country takes under this convention to protect a child or their property must be recognised in all other signatory countries.\nOnly in a limited number of cases, as specified in the convention, may a country refuse recognition.\nWhen protection measures are declared enforceable in another country, that country must enforce them as if it had taken them itself, and do so in accordance with its own law.\nCooperation\nEach signatory country must designate one or more central authorities to carry out the obligations imposed on it by the convention.\nThese authorities must cooperate and exchange information with each other, as well as promote cooperation in such cases among their national authorities.\nBACKGROUND\nProtecting children’s rights – EU information\nACT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2003/93/EC of 19 December 2002 authorising the Member States, in the interest of the Community, to sign the 1996 Hague Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children (OJ L 48, 21.2.2003, pp. 1–2)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2008/431/EC of 5 June 2008 authorising certain Member States to ratify, or accede to, in the interest of the European Community, the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children and authorising certain Member States to make a declaration on the application of the relevant internal rules of Community law - Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (OJ L 151, 11.6.2008, pp. 36–48)\nlast update 26.07.2016", "tags": ["judicial proceedings", "parental responsibility", "European convention", "child protection", "mutual recognition principle", "European judicial area"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
