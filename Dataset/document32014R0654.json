This is particularly the case in situations where third countries enact trade restrictive measures that diminish the benefits accruing to the Union's economic operators under international trade agreements. The Union should be in a position to react swiftly and in a flexible manner in the context of the procedures and deadlines set out by the international trade agreements which it has concluded. There is therefore a need for rules defining the framework for exercising the Union's rights in certain specific situations.\n(3)\nThe dispute settlement mechanisms set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and by other international trade agreements, including regional or bilateral agreements, aim at finding a positive solution to any disputes arising between the Union and the other party or parties to those agreements. The Union should, nevertheless, be able to suspend concessions or other obligations, in accordance with those dispute settlement mechanisms, when other avenues to find a positive solution to a dispute have proven unsuccessful. Action by the Union in such cases should serve the purpose of inducing compliance of the third country concerned with the relevant international trade rules in order to restore a situation of reciprocal benefits.\n(4)\nUnder the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, a WTO member proposing to apply a safeguard measure or seeking an extension of a safeguard measure has to endeavour to maintain a substantially equivalent level of concessions and other obligations between it and the exporting Members, which would be affected by such a measure. Similar rules are laid down in other international trade agreements concluded by the Union, including regional or bilateral agreements. The Union should take rebalancing measures by suspending concessions or other obligations in cases where the third country concerned implements no adequate and proportionate adjustments. Action by the Union in such cases should serve the purpose of inducing the introduction of trade-enhancing measures by third countries in order to restore a situation of reciprocal benefits.\n(5)\nArticle XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and the related Understanding govern the modification or withdrawal of concessions established in the tariff schedules of WTO Members. WTO Members affected by any such modification are entitled, under certain conditions, to withdraw substantially equivalent concessions. The Union should adopt rebalancing measures in such cases, unless compensatory adjustments are agreed. Action by the Union should be aimed at inducing third countries to implement trade-enhancing measures.\n(6)\nThe Union should have the possibility to enforce its rights in the area of public procurement when a trade partner fails to respect its commitments under the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) or other international trade agreements. The GPA states that any dispute arising thereunder is not to result in the suspension of concessions or other obligations under any other covered agreement of the WTO. The Union's action should be aimed at ensuring the maintenance of a substantially equivalent level of concessions, as laid down in the relevant international trade agreements.\n(7)\nMember States should ensure the application within their respective territories of commercial policy measures in the field of public procurement in the manner that is best suited to their administrative structures and practices, while respecting Union law.\n(8)\nCommercial policy measures adopted under this Regulation should be selected and designed on the basis of objective criteria, including the effectiveness of the measures in inducing compliance of third countries with international trade rules, their potential to provide relief to economic operators within the Union affected by third country measures, and the aim of minimising negative economic impacts on the Union, including with regard to essential raw materials.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should focus on those measures in respect of which the Union has experience in design and application. The possibility to extend its scope in order to provide for the adoption of measures in the sector of intellectual property rights and additional measures concerning services should be assessed as part of the review on the functioning of this Regulation, with due regard to the specificities of each area.\n(10)\nWhen enforcing the Union's rights, the origin of a good should be determined in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 (2). When enforcing the Union's rights following dispute settlement in the area of public procurement, the origin of a service should be determined on the basis of the origin of the natural or legal person providing it. Contracting authorities or entities should apply normal precautions and exercise due diligence when assessing information and guarantees provided by tenderers as regards the origin of goods and services.\n(11)\nThe Commission should review the scope, functioning and efficiency of this Regulation, including possible measures in the sector of intellectual property rights and additional measures concerning services, no later than three years after the first instance of its implementation or no later than five years from its date of entry into force, whichever is the earlier. The Commission should report on its assessment to the European Parliament and the Council. The review may be followed up by appropriate legislative proposals.\n(12)\nIt is important to ensure an effective communication and exchange of views between the Commission on the one hand and the European Parliament and the Council on the other, in particular on disputes under international trade agreements that may lead to the adoption of measures under this Regulation.\n(13)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 (3) should be amended in order to refer to this Regulation with regard to the implementation of commercial policy measures.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).\n(15)\nIn light of the high complexity involved in the examination of the multiple impacts that commercial policy measures adopted under this Regulation may have, and with a view to allowing sufficient opportunities to achieve the widest possible support, implementing acts should not be adopted by the Commission where, exceptionally, the committee referred to in this Regulation delivers no opinion on the draft implementing act presented by the Commission.\n(16)\nIn order to safeguard the Union's interests, the Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the need to adapt commercial policy measures to the behaviour of the third party concerned, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(17)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the possible adoption of commercial policy measures on the basis of other relevant Union acts or of the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, while respecting the applicable provisions in international trade agreements on the suspension or withdrawal of concessions or other obligations,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules and procedures to ensure an effective and timely exercise of the Union's rights to suspend or withdraw concessions or other obligations under international trade agreements, with the intention of:\n(a)\nresponding to breaches by third countries of international trade rules which affect the Union's interests, with a view to seeking a satisfactory solution that restores benefits for the Union's economic operators;\n(b)\nrebalancing concessions or other obligations in the trade relations with third countries, when the treatment accorded to goods from the Union is altered in a way that affects the Union's interests.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n\"country\" means any State or separate customs territory;\n(b)\n\"concessions or other obligations\" means tariff concessions or any other benefits that the Union has committed itself to applying in its trade with third countries by virtue of international trade agreements to which it is a party;\n(c)\n\"level of nullification or impairment\" means the degree to which the benefits accruing to the Union under an international trade agreement are affected. Except as otherwise defined in the relevant agreement, it includes any adverse economic impact resulting from a third country measure;\n(d)\n\"mandatory price penalty\" means an obligation on contracting authorities or entities conducting public procurement procedures to increase, subject to certain exceptions, the price of services and/or goods originating in certain third countries that have been offered in contract award procedures.\nArticle 3\nScope\nThis Regulation applies:\n(a)\nfollowing the adjudication of trade disputes under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding), when the Union has been authorised to suspend concessions or other obligations under the multilateral and plurilateral agreements covered by the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding;\n(b)\nfollowing the adjudication of trade disputes under other international trade agreements, including regional or bilateral agreements, when the Union has the right to suspend concessions or other obligations under such agreements;\n(c)\nfor the rebalancing of concessions or other obligations, to which the application of a safeguard measure by a third country may give right pursuant to Article 8 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, or to the provisions on safeguards included in other international trade agreements, including regional or bilateral agreements;\n(d)\nin cases of modification of concessions by a WTO member under Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994, where no compensatory adjustments have been agreed.\nArticle 4\nExercise of the Union's rights\n1.

Commercial policy measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined on the basis of the following criteria, in light of available information and of the Union's general interest:\n(a)\neffectiveness of the measures in inducing compliance of third countries with international trade rules;\n(b)\npotential of the measures to provide relief to economic operators within the Union affected by third country measures;\n(c)\navailability of alternative sources of supply for the goods or services concerned, in order to avoid or minimise any negative impact on downstream industries, contracting authorities or entities, or final consumers within the Union;\n(d)\navoidance of disproportionate administrative complexity and costs in the application of the measures;\n(e)\nany specific criteria that may be established in international trade agreements in connection with the cases referred to in Article 3.\nArticle 5\nCommercial policy measures\n1.

In exercising that empowerment, the Commission intends to act in accordance with this Declaration.\nWhen preparing draft implementing acts, the Commission will undertake extensive consultations with a view to ensuring that all relevant interests are duly taken into account. Through those consultations, the Commission expects to receive input from private stakeholders affected by third country measures or by possible commercial policy measures to be adopted by the Union. Similarly, the Commission expects to receive input from public authorities that may be involved in the implementation of possible commercial policy measures to be adopted by the Union. In the case of measures in the field of public procurement, in particular input from Member States’ public authorities will be duly taken into account in the preparation of draft implementing acts.\nThe Commission recognizes the importance of Member States receiving timely information when it is considering the adoption of implementing acts under this Regulation so as to enable them to contribute to fully informed decisions and will act to achieve this objective.\nThe Commission confirms that it will promptly transmit to the Parliament and to the Council draft implementing acts that it submits to the committee of Member States. Similarly, it will promptly transmit to the Parliament and the Council final draft implementing acts following the delivery of opinions in the committee.\nThe Commission will keep the Parliament and the Council regularly informed of international developments that may lead to situations requiring the adoption of measures under the Regulation. This will be done through the responsible committees in Council and in Parliament.\nThe Commission welcomes the Parliament’s intention to promote a structured dialogue on dispute settlement and enforcement issues and will fully engage in dedicated sessions with the responsible Parliamentary committee to exchange views on trade disputes and enforcement actions, including with regard to impacts on Union industries.\nFinally, the Commission confirms that it attaches great importance to ensuring that the Regulation is an effective and efficient tool for the enforcement of the Union’s rights under international trade agreements, including in the field of trade in services. Therefore, the Commission will, in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation, review the scope of Article 5 with a view to covering additional commercial policy measures concerning trade in services as soon as the conditions for ensuring the workability and effectiveness of such measures are present.", "summary": "EU rights to apply and enforce international trade rules\nEU rights to apply and enforce international trade rules\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 654/2014 — the EU’s rights to apply and enforce international trade rules — amending Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 laying down procedures to ensure the EU’s rights under international trade rules\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt ensures that the EU is able to enforce and exercise its rights under international trade agreements by adopting trade policy measures.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation sets out rules and procedures for the EU to suspend or withdraw its obligations under an international trade agreement in order to:\nrespond to breaches of international trade rules by non-EU countries and enforce a judicial ruling in favour of the EU, to obtain a satisfactory solution that restores benefits for EU businesses;\nrebalance obligations under and in line with a trade agreement, when non-EU countries alter the treatment of goods from the EU, either temporarily through a safeguard measure or long-term through modifying tariff concessions.\nAction\nTo safeguard the EU’s interests, the European Commission can adopt implementing acts to adapt its trade policy in response to the actions of the non-EU country concerned. In urgent cases, the Commission can immediately adopt applicable implementing acts. The Commission, assisted by the EU Member States, consults with relevant stakeholders before adopting these acts.\nAvailable trade policy measures\nThese consist of:\nsuspending tariff concessions and imposing new or increased customs duties;\nintroducing or increasing quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports or exports of goods;\nsuspending concessions and introducing certain restrictions in the area of public procurement.\nDetermining appropriate measures\nTrade policy measures are determined based on the following:\neffectiveness of the measures in inducing the non-EU country to comply with international trade rules;\npotential of the measures to provide relief to businesses within the EU affected by non-EU country measures;\navailability of alternative sources of supply for the goods or services concerned;\navoiding disproportionate administrative complexity and costs in applying the measures;\nmeasures must be proportionate to and must not exceed the harm that they are introduced to counteract.\nRevision of the regulation\nBecause a current lack of new appointments to the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has meant that the second tier of its dispute settlement mechanism is not able to function, amending Regulation (EU) 2021/167 introduced some changes to Regulation (EU) No 654/2014.\nThe amending Regulation (EU) 2021/167:\nallows enforcement action in situations where: the EU obtains a favourable ruling from a WTO dispute settlement panel,the process is then blocked because the non-EU country appeals to the non-functioning WTO Appellate Body, and does not agree to interim appeal arbitration under Article 25 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding;\nallows enforcement action when: a trade partner under a bilateral or regional trade agreement imposes illegal trade measures,subsequently does not take the steps necessary for the dispute settlement process under that agreement to function;\nextends the scope of possible countermeasures to trade in services and some trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. This extension is accompanied by safeguards to ensure that the most efficient and proportionate countermeasures are used and that EU Member States’ authorities and stakeholders are consulted.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\nRegulation (EU) No 654/2014 has applied since 17 July 2014.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2021/167 has applied since 13 February 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nDispute settlement (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 654/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 concerning the exercise of the Union’s rights for the application and enforcement of international trade rules and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community’s rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (OJ L 189, 27.6.2014, pp. 50-58)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 654/2014 have been incorporated into the original text.
