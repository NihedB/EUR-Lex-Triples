Greater transparency on energy costs and prices, as well as on the level of public support, should be made available to improve market integration. This Regulation does not entail any harmonisation of the structure of prices or charges across Member States.\n(4)\nTo date, Directive 2008/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) has provided a common framework for producing, transmitting and disseminating comparable statistics on the natural gas and electricity prices charged to industrial customers in the Union.\n(5)\nThe collection of data on natural gas and electricity prices charged to final customers in the household sector has so far been carried out on the basis of a voluntary agreement.\n(6)\nThe growing complexity of the internal energy market makes it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable and up-to-date price data on natural gas and electricity in the absence of legally binding obligations to provide such data, in particular on the household sector.\n(7)\nIn order to guarantee the reporting of high-quality price data for the household sector and for the non-household sector, the collection of both types of data should be covered by a legislative act.\n(8)\nIn most Member States, data on transmission systems are available from energy regulators. However, a much larger number of data compilers are involved in distribution costs and the reporting of data is considered to be more difficult in some Member States. Given the significance of distribution costs and the need for transparency on this matter, the collection of data on natural gas and electricity prices should follow the established practices within the European Statistical System.\n(9)\nThe system of consumption bands used by the Commission (Eurostat) in its price publications should ensure transparency of the market and broad dissemination of non-confidential price data, and should enable the calculation of European aggregates.\n(10)\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) is the reference framework for European statistics. That Regulation provides for statistics to be collected in accordance with the principles of impartiality, transparency, reliability, objectivity, professional independence and cost-effectiveness, while protecting statistical confidentiality.\n(11)\nMember States should compile the data on natural gas and electricity prices by using the most appropriate sources and methods to provide the required information.\n(12)\nData on prices charged to final customers of natural gas and electricity should enable comparisons with the prices of other energy commodities.\n(13)\nInformation on the collection of data on prices and on the quality of data should be provided as part of standard reporting procedure.\n(14)\nDetailed data on the breakdown of consumption bands and their respective market shares are an essential part of natural gas and electricity price statistics.\n(15)\nPrice analysis can be carried out only if high-quality official statistics are available from Member States regarding the different components and sub-components of natural gas and electricity prices. A revised methodology for generating a detailed breakdown of the various components and sub-components of the prices of natural gas and electricity charged to final customers will make it possible to analyse the impact of different aspects on the final prices.\n(16)\nThe data provided to the Commission (Eurostat) on prices and conditions of sale to final customers, and the breakdown of the number of final customers by consumption in each consumption band, should contain all the information necessary to enable the Commission to decide on appropriate measures or proposals in relation to energy policy.\n(17)\nA good understanding of the taxes, fees, levies and charges in each Member State is essential for ensuring price transparency. The importance of a breakdown of the data on network costs, taxes, fees, levies and charges has been identified.\n(18)\nMember States in which there is low consumption of natural gas as a proportion of the final energy consumption of households should be exempt from the obligation to provide data on natural gas prices for final household customers.\n(19)\nTo improve data reliability, the Commission (Eurostat), together with the Member States, should assess and, if required, improve the methodology for collecting and processing data in a precise manner, in accordance with the governance framework for statistics. Therefore, quality reports should be prepared regularly and assessments of the quality of price data should be carried out regularly.\n(20)\nBased on a reasoned request from a Member State, the Commission should be entitled to grant derogations to that Member State in relation to specific obligations for which the application of this Regulation to the national statistical system of that Member State requires major adaptations or is likely to lead to a significant additional burden on respondents.\n(21)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the format of and arrangements for the transmission of data, technical quality assurance requirements regarding the content of standard quality reports, and the granting of derogations. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).\n(22)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the systematic production of European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(23)\nDirective 2008/92/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(24)\nThe European Statistical System Committee has been consulted,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of comparable European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices for household and final non-household customers in the Union.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘autoproducers’, ‘final energy consumption’ and ‘household’ have the same meaning as that attributed to those terms in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5);\n(2)\n‘transmission’, ‘distribution’, ‘customer’, ‘final customer’, ‘household customer’, ‘non-household customer’ and ‘supply’ have the same meaning as that attributed to those terms in Article 2 of Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), when used in relation to electricity;\n(3)\n‘transmission’, ‘distribution’, ‘supply’, ‘customer’, ‘household customer’, ‘non-household customer’ and ‘final customer’ have the same meaning as that attributed to those terms in Article 2 of Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), when used in relation to natural gas;\n(4)\n‘network component’ means the combination of transmission and distribution network costs as set out in point 6 of Annex I and in point 5 of Annex II.\nArticle 3\nData sources\nMember States shall compile data on natural gas and electricity prices, and their components and sub-components concerning network costs, taxes, fees, levies and charges, and on consumption volumes, in accordance with Annexes I and II. One or more of the following sources shall be used, after taking into account the principles of reducing burden on respondents and of administrative simplification:\n(a)\nstatistical surveys;\n(b)\nadministrative sources;\n(c)\nother sources applying statistical estimation methods.\nArticle 4\nCoverage\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the data collection and compilation in accordance with Annexes I and II provide comprehensible and comparable high-quality data that are representative of their respective natural gas and electricity prices and consumption.\n2.   Member States shall not be obliged to transmit data on natural gas prices for household customers if the consumption of natural gas in the household sector accounts for less than 1,5 % of national final energy consumption in the household sector.\n3.
