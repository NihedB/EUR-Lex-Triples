As from 1 January 1993, the minimum rate of excise duty on alcohol and alcohol contained in beverages other than those referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6 shall be fixed at ECU 550 per hectolitre of pure alcohol.\nHowever, Member States which apply to alcohol and alcoholic beverages a rate of duty not exceeding ECU 1 000 per hectolitre of pure alcohol may not reduce their national rate. In addition Member States which apply to the said products a rate of duty exceeding ECU 1 000 per hectolitre of pure alcohol may not reduce their national rate below ECU 1 000.\n2.   The Kingdom of Denmark may, however, maintain its existing system of taxing alcohol and the alcohol contained in other products until 30 June 1996, provided that the application of that system never results in the application of a charge which falls below that which would arise from the application of paragraph 1 in accordance with the rules laid down in Directive 92/83/EEC.\n3.   The Italian Republik may, however, maintain its existing system of taxing alcohol and the alcohol contained in other products, which provides a reduced rate for some categories of alcohol, until 30 June 1996, provided that the application of that system never results in the application of a charge which falls below that which would arise from the application of paragraph 1 in accordance with the rules laid down in Council Directive 92/83/EEC.\nArticle 4\nAs from 1 January 1993, the minimum rate of excise duty on intermediate products shall be fixed at ECU 45 per hectolitre of product.\nArticle 5\nAs from 1 January 1993, the minimum rate of excise duty on wine shall be fixed:\n—\nfor still wine at ECU 0,\nand\n—\nfor sparkling wine at ECU 0\nper hectolitre of product.\nArticle 6\nAs from 1 January 1993, the minimum rate of excise duty on beer shall be fixed:\n—\nECU 0,748 per hectolitre/degree Plato,\nor\n—\nECU 1,87 per hectolitre/degree of alcohol\nof finished product.\nArticle 7\n1.   The Hellenic Republic may apply a reduced rate of excise duty to ethyl alcohol consumed in the departments of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, the Dodecanese and the Cyclades and on the following islands in the Aegean: Thasos, Northern Sporades, Samothrace and Skiros.\nThe reduced rate, which may fall below the minimum rate of duty, may not fall more than 50 % below the standard national rate of duty on ethyl alcohol.\n2.   The Italian Republic may continue to apply the exemptions and reduced rates of excise duty, which may fall below the minimum rates, which were applied on 1 January 1992 to alcohol and alcoholic drinks consumed in the regions of Gorizia and the Aosta valley.\n3.   The Portuguese Republik may continue to apply, in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores, reduced rates of excise duty not falling more than 50 % below the national rates, on the following products:\n(a)\nin Madeira\n—\nwine obtained from the purely regional grape varieties specified in Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 4252/88,\n—\nrum as defined in Article 1 (4) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 having the geographical characteristics set out in Article 5 (3) and Annex II, point 1, of that Regulation,\n—\nliqueurs produced from sub-tropical fruit enriched with sugar cane eau-de-vie and having the characteristics and qualities defined in Article 5 (3) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89;\n(b)\nin the Azores\n—\nliqueurs as defined in Article 1 (4) (r) of Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 produced from passion fruit and pineapple,\n—\neau-de-vie made from wine or from grape marc having the characteristics and qualities defined in Article 1 (4) (d) and (f) of Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89.\nArticle 8\nEvery two years, and for the first time not later than 31 December 1994, the Council, acting on the basis of a report and, where appropriate, a proposal from the Commission, shall examine the rates of duty laid down herein and, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, shall adopt the necessary measures. The report by the Commission and the consideration by the Council shall take into account the proper functioning of the internal market, competition between the different categories of alcoholic drinks, the real value of the rates of duty and the wider objectives of the Treaty.\nArticle 9\n1.   The value of the ecu in national currencies to be applied to the value of specific excise duties shall be fixed once a year. The rates to be applied shall be those obtaining on the first working day of October and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and shall have effect from 1 January of the following calendar year.\n2.   Member States may maintain the amounts of the excise duties in force at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 1 if the conversion of the amounts of the excise duties expressed in ecu would result in an increase of less than 5 % or less than ECU 5, whichever is the lower amount, in the excise duty expressed in national currency.\nArticle 10\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 1992. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication.

The Commission analyses the effect of the current system on the proper functioning of the internal market, the competition between the different categories of alcoholic drinks induced by different rates of excise duty, the real current value of the minimum rates of duty set in 1992 and the wider objectives of the Treaty on European Union. It concludes that greater convergence is needed between the rates of excise duty applied in different Member States, so as to reduce distortions of competition and fraud. In view of the highly disparate opinions of Member States on the appropriate level of minimum excise duty, and since any change would require unanimous agreement, the Commission refrains from formulating proposals at this stage. Instead it intends to launch a broad debate in the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee. On the basis of the outcome of this debate, the Commission will decide whether or not to submit proposals on some or all of the issues raised in this report.\nCouncil Decision 2002/166/EC of 18 February 2002 authorising France to extend the application of a reduced rate of excise duty on \"traditional\" rum produced in its overseas departments [Official Journal L 55 of 26.02.2002].\nThis Decision is justified by the fact that the distilleries in Reunion, Martinique and Guadeloupe can keep up their activities only by retaining their share of the market in mainland France. Moreover, this industry, which is not competitive, provides some 40 000 jobs. However, the reduced rate may not be more than 50% lower than the standard national excise duty on alcohol and is confined to an annual quota of 90 000 hl of pure alcohol. The measure aims to extend the derogation authorised by the Council Decision of 30 October 1995 which expires on 31 December 2002. The extension will run for a period of seven years, from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2009.\nCouncil Decision 2002/167/EC of 18 February 2002 authorising Portugal to apply a reduced rate of excise duty in the autonomous region of Madeira on locally produced and consumed rum and liqueurs and eaux-de-vie [Official Journal L 55 of 26.02.2002].\nThe derogation introduced by the Decision is considered to be vital for the survival of the local industry producing and marketing the beverages produced in Madeira and the Azores. Sales of these spirits also provide 130 jobs. The reduced rate may not be more than 75% lower than the standard national excise duty on alcohol. The extension will run for a period of seven years, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2008.\nLast updated: 17.08.2004", "tags": ["excise duty", "tax harmonisation", "alcoholic beverage"], "subjects": ["Approximation of laws", "Taxation", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Internal market - Principles"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
