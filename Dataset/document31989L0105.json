Member States shall ensure that any national measure, whether laid down by law, regulation or administrative action, to control the prices of medicinal products for human use or to restrict the range of medicinal products covered by their national health insurance systems complies with the requirements of this Directive.\n2.   The definition of ‘medicinal products’ laid down in Article 1 of Directive 65/65/EEC shall apply to this Directive.\n3.   Nothing in this Directive shall permit the marketing of a proprietary medicinal product in respect of which the authorization provided for in Article 3 of Directive 65/65/EEC has not been issued.\nArticle 2\nThe following provisions shall apply if the marketing of a medicinal product is permitted only after the competent authorities of the Member State concerned have approved the price of the product:\n1.\nMember States shall ensure that a decision on the price which may be charged for the medicinal product concerned is adopted and communicated to the applicant within 90 days of the receipt of an application submitted, in accordance with the requirements laid down in the Member State concerned, by the holder of a marketing authorization.

If the information supporting the application is inadequate, the competent authorities shall forthwith notify the applicant of what detailed additional information is required and take their final decision within 90 days of receipt of this additional information. In the absence of such a decision within the abovementioned period or periods, the applicant shall be entitled to market the product at the price proposed.\n2.\nShould the competent authorities decide not to permit the marketing of the medicinal product concerned at the price proposed by the applicant, the decision shall contain a statement of reasons based on objective and verifiable criteria. In addition, the applicant shall be informed of the remedies available to him under the laws in force and the time limits allowed for applying for such remedies.\n3.\nAt least once a year, the competent authorities shall publish in an appropriate publication, and communicate to the Commission, a list of the medicinal products the price of which has been fixed during the relevant period, together with the prices which may be charged for such products.\nArticle 3\nWithout prejudice to Article 4, the following provisions shall apply if an increase in the price of a medicinal product is permitted only after prior approval has been obtained from the competent authorities:\n1.\nMember States shall ensure that a decision is adopted on an application submitted, in accordance with the requirements laid down in the Member State concerned, by the holder of a marketing authorization to increase the price of a medicinal product and communicated to the applicant within 90 days of its receipt. The applicant shall furnish the competent authorities with adequate information including details of those events intervening since the price of the medicinal product was last determined which in his opinion justify the price increase requested. If the information supporting the application is inadequate, the competent authorities shall forthwith notify the applicant of what detailed additional information is required and take their final decision within 90 days of receipt of this additional information.\nIn case of an exceptional number of applications, the period may be extended once only for a further 60 days. The applicant shall be notified of such extension before the expiry of the period.\nIn the absence of such a decision within the abovementioned period or periods, the applicant shall be entitled to apply in full the price increase requested.\n2.\nShould the competent authorities decide not to permit the whole or part of the price increase requested, the decision shall contain a statement of reasons based on objective and verifiable criteria and the applicant shall be informed of the remedies available to him under the laws in force and the time limits allowed for applying for such remedies.\n3.\nAt least once a year, the competent authorities shall publish in an appropriate publication and communicate to the Commission, a list of the medicinal products for which price increases have been granted during the relevant period, together with the new price which may be charged for such products.\nArticle 4\n1.   In the event of a price freeze imposed on all medicinal products or on certain categories of medicinal products by the competent authorities of a Member State, that Member State shall carry out a review, at least once a year, to ascertain whether the macro-economic conditions justify that the freeze be continued unchanged Within 90 days of the start of this review, the competent authorities shall announce what increases or decreases in prices are being made, if any.\n2.   In exceptional cases, a person who is the holder of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product may apply for a derogation from a price freeze if this is justified by particular reasons. The application shall contain an adequate statement of these reasons. Member States shall ensure that a reasoned decision on any such application is adopted and communicated to the applicant within 90 days.

The applicant shall be notified of such extension before the expiry of the initial period.\nArticle 5\nWhere a Member State adopts a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of persons responsible for placing medicinal products on the market, the Member State concerned shall publish the following information in an appropriate publication and communicate it to the Commission:\n(a)\nthe method or methods used in the Member State concerned to define profitability: return on sales and/or return on capital;\n(b)\nthe range of target profit currently permitted to persons responsible for placing medicinal products on the market in the Member State concerned;\n(c)\nthe criteria according to which target rates of profit are accorded to an individual responsible for placing medicinal products on the market, together with the criteria according to which they will be allowed to retain profits above their given targets in the Member State concerned;\n(d)\nthe maximum percentage profit which any person responsible for placing medicinal products on the market is allowed to retain above his target in the Member State concerned.\nThis information shalhbe updated once a year or when significant changes are made.\nWhere, in addition to operating a system of direct or indirect controls on profits, a Member State operates a system of controls on the prices of certain types of medicinal products which are excluded from the scope of the profit control scheme, Articles 2, 3 and 4 shall, where relevant, apply to such price controls. However, the said Articles shall not apply where the normal operation of a system of direct or indirect controls on profits results exceptionally in a price being fixed for an individual medicinal product.\nArticle 6\nThe following provisions shall apply if a medicinal product is covered by the national health insurance system only after the competent authorities have decided to include the medicinal product concerned in a positive list of medicinal products covered by the national health insurance system.\n1.\nMember States shall ensure that a decision on an application submitted, in accordance with the requirements laid down in the Member State concerned, by the holder of a marketing authorization to include a medicinal product in the list of medicinal products covered by the health insurance systems is adopted and communicated to the applicant within 90 days of its receipt.

EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 1989.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nAfter conducting a review of the legislation, the Commission proposed a new directive in March 2012. This aimed to streamline procedures and reduce the time taken by national decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The legal proposal aimed at simplification of procedures as well as at improving the legal clarity and certainty for all interested parties The proposal was subsequently withdrawn by the Commission in March 2015.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union has handed down several judgments on the interpretation and implementation of the transparency legislation.\nFor more information, see:\n‘Transparency Directive’ on the European Commission’s website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 89/105/EEC of 21 December 1988 relating to the transparency of measures regulating the prices of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems (OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, pp. 8–11)\nlast update 23.08.2016", "tags": ["marketing", "pharmaceutical legislation", "health costs", "health insurance", "medicinal product", "disclosure of information"], "subjects": ["Social provisions", "Approximation of laws", "Internal market - Principles"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"31989L0105_p1": {"text": "Whereas marketing authorizations for proprietary medicinal products issued pursuant to Council directive 65/65/eec of 26 January 1965 on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to proprietary medicinal products (4), as last amended by directive 87/21/eec (5), may be refused only for reasons relating to the quality, safety or efficacy of the proprietary medicinal products concerned;", "triples": [" directive 87/21/eec,  amended,  directive 65/65/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
