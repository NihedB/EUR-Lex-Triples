{"celex_id": "32008D0070(01)", "reference": "26.1.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 23/21\nDECISION No 70/2008/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 January 2008\non a paperless environment for customs and trade\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 95 and 135 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Community and the Member States have committed themselves, under the Lisbon Agenda, to increasing the competitiveness of companies doing business in Europe. Pursuant to Decision 2004/387/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on interoperable delivery of pan-European e-Government services to public administrations, businesses and citizens (IDABC) (3), the Commission and the Member States should provide efficient, effective and interoperable information and communication systems for the exchange of information between public administrations and Community citizens.\n(2)\nThe pan-European e-Government action, as provided for by Decision 2004/387/EC, requires measures to increase the efficiency of the organisation of customs controls and ensure the seamless flow of data in order to make customs clearance more efficient, reduce administrative burdens, help to combat fraud, organised crime and terrorism, serve fiscal interests, protect intellectual property and cultural heritage, increase the safety of goods and the security of international trade and enhance health and environmental protection. For that purpose, the provision of information and communication technologies (ICT) for customs purposes is of crucial interest.\n(3)\nThe Council Resolution of 5 December 2003 on creating a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade (4), which followed on from the Commission Communication on a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade, calls upon the Commission to draw up, in close cooperation with the Member States, a multi-annual strategic plan for creating a coherent and interoperable electronic customs environment for the Community. Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (5) requires the use of data processing techniques for lodging summary declarations and for the electronic exchange of data between customs authorities, with a view to basing customs controls on automated risk-analysis systems.\n(4)\nAccordingly, it is necessary to lay down the objectives to be met in creating a paperless environment for customs and trade, as well as the structure, means and time limits for doing so.\n(5)\nThe Commission should implement this Decision in close cooperation with the Member States. It is therefore necessary to specify the respective responsibilities and tasks of the parties concerned and to make provision as to how costs are to be shared between the Commission and the Member States.\n(6)\nThe Commission and the Member States should share responsibility for the Community and national components of the communication and information exchange systems, in accordance with the principles set out in Decision No 253/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 February 2003 adopting an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2007) (6) and taking account of Decision No 2235/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2002 adopting a Community programme to improve the operation of taxation systems in the internal market (Fiscalis programme 2003-2007) (7).\n(7)\nTo ensure compliance with this Decision and consistency between the different systems to be developed, it is necessary to establish a monitoring mechanism.\n(8)\nRegular reports by Member States and the Commission should provide information on the progress of implementation of this Decision.\n(9)\nIn order to achieve a paperless environment, there is a need for close cooperation between the Commission, customs authorities and economic operators. To facilitate that cooperation, the Customs Policy Group should ensure the coordination of the activities necessary for the implementation of this Decision. Consultation with economic operators should take place at both national and Community level at all stages of the preparation of those activities.\n(10)\nAcceding countries and candidate countries should be permitted to participate in those activities, with a view to preparing for accession.\n(11)\nSince the objective of this Decision, namely the creation of a paperless environment for customs and trade, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(12)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8).\n(13)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to extend the time limits set out in Article 4(2), (3) and (5) of this Decision. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Decision, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nElectronic customs systems\nThe Commission and the Member States shall set up secure, integrated, interoperable and accessible electronic customs systems for the exchange of data contained in customs declarations, documents accompanying customs declarations and certificates and the exchange of other relevant information.\nThe Commission and the Member States shall provide the structure and means for the operation of those electronic customs systems.\nArticle 2\nObjectives\n1.

Such systems facilitate trade by reducing costs and coordinating procedures. They also permit the exchange of data between the customs administrations of EU countries, traders and the Commission. In this way, they improve and facilitate supply chain logistics and customs processes.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nFollowing on from the 2003 communication on creating a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade, it was agreed under this decision that the Commission and the EU countries would set up:\nsecure;\nintegrated;\ninteroperable; and\naccessible e-customs systems for the exchange of data contained in customs declarationsdocuments accompanying customs declarations and certificates andother relevant information.\nThe Commission and the EU countries are to establish the structure and means for the operation of those e-customs systems.\nMeasures\nTo meet the objectives set out in the decision, the EU needs to:\nharmonise the exchange of information;\nreview customs processes with a view to optimising their efficiency and effectiveness;\noffer traders a wide range of e-customs services.\nThe Commission’s role\nThe Commission must coordinate:\nthe setting-up, testing, operation and maintenance of the EU components of the computerised systems;\nthe systems and services set out in this proposal with other projects concerning e-government services;\nthe parallel development of national and EU elements;\nautomatic customs services and single-window services* at EU level;\nthe completion of the tasks allocated to it under a multiannual strategic plan;\ntraining needs.\nThe Commission must also monitor progress with regard to the Customs Policy Group. It must also initiate regular consultations with the economic stakeholders concerned.\nRole of EU countries\nEU countries must ensure the following:\nthe setting-up, testing, operation and maintenance of the national components of the computerised systems;\nthe coordination of the systems and services provided for in this decision with other relevant projects relating to e-government at national level;\nthe completion of the tasks allocated to them under the multiannual strategic plan and work programmes — the latest work programme is contained in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/578 on developing and deploying the electronic systems needed to implement the EU Customs Code (which replaced the Community Customs Code);\nthe promotion and implementation at national level of e-customs services and single-window services;\ntraining for officials.\nTimetable for automated customs services\nThe decision contains a list of systems and databases and sets out the timetable for their implementation. Single-window services should be available within 6 years.\nFinancing\nThe decision states that the costs of its implementation were to be shared between the EU and EU countries based on their EU or national character. EU countries were to develop cost-sharing models. Currently, EU aspects of the work to modernise customs receive funding under the Customs 2020 action programme.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 15 February 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nElectronic customs (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nSingle-window services: a facility which allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardised information and documents with a single entry point to fulfil all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements.
