In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.(2) Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(4) requires tests to be carried out on chemical substances in order to enable their potential risk to man and the environment to be determined.(3) When the active substances in pesticides undergo tests they should do so in accordance with Directive 67/548/EEC.(4) Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products(5) and Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use(6) lay down that non-clinical tests on pharmaceutical products are to be carried out in accordance with the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) in force in the Community for chemical substances, compliance with which is also required by other Community legislation.(5) The methods to be used for these tests are laid down in Annex V to Directive 67/548/EEC.(6) It is necessary to comply with the principles of GLP in carrying out the tests laid down by Directive 67/548/EEC so as to ensure that the results are comparable and of high quality.(7) The resources devoted to the tests should not be wasted by having to repeat tests owing to differences in laboratory practice from one Member State to another.(8) The Council of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) took a Decision on 12 May 1981 on the mutual acceptance of data for the evaluation of chemical products. It issued a recommendation on 26 July 1983 concerning the mutual recognition of compliance with GLP. The principles of GLP have been modified by OECD Council Decision (C(97) 186 (final)).(9) Animal protection requires that the number of experiments conducted on animals be restricted. Mutual recognition of the results of tests obtained using standard and recognised methods is an essential condition for reducing the number of experiments in this area.(10) It is necessary to set up a procedure allowing rapid adaptation of the principles of GLP.(11) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits for transposition of the directives set out in Annex II, part B,HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 11. Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that laboratories carrying out tests on chemical products, in accordance with Directive 67/548/EEC, comply with the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) as laid down in Annex I to this Directive.2. Paragraph 1 shall apply also where other Community provisions provide for the application of the principles of GLP in respect of tests on chemical products to evaluate their safety for man and/or the environment.Article 2When submitting results, the laboratories referred to in Article 1 shall certify that the tests have been carried out in conformity with the principles of GLP referred to in that Article.Article 31. Member States shall adopt the measures necessary for verification of compliance with the principles of GLP. These measures shall include, in particular, inspections and study checks in accordance with the recommendations of the OECD in this area.2. Member States shall notify to the Commission the name or names of the authority or authorities responsible for verifying compliance with the principles of GLP, as referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof.Article 4Any adaptation to the principles of GLP mentioned in Article 1 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 29 of Directive 67/548/EEC.Article 51. Where Community provisions require application of the principles of GLP following the entry into force of this Directive for tests on chemical products, Member States may not, on grounds relating to the principles of GLP, prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market of chemical products if the principles applied by the laboratories concerned are in conformity with those mentioned in Article 1.2. Should a Member State establish on the basis of detailed evidence that the application of the principles of GLP and the verification of their application for tests on chemical substances show that, although a chemical substance has been examined in accordance with the requirements of this Directive, it presents a danger to man and the environment, the Member State may provisionally prohibit or make subject to special conditions the marketing of that substance on its territory. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof and give the grounds for its decision.The Commission shall, within six weeks, consult the Member States concerned and then give its opinion and take suitable measures without delay.Should the Commission consider that technical adaptations to this Directive are necessary, those adaptations shall be adopted either by the Commission or by the Council in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 4. In that case, the Member State which adopted the safeguard measures may maintain them until the entry into force of those adaptations.Article 6Directive 87/18/EEC is hereby repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits for transposition of the Directives set out in Annex II, part B.References made to the repealed Directive shall be construed as being made to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.Article 7This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.Article 8This Directive is addressed to the Member States.Done at Strasbourg, 11 February 2004.For the European ParliamentThe PresidentP.

As a consequence, OECD Member States have established criteria for the performance of these studies.To avoid different schemes of implementation that could impede international trade in chemicals, OECD Member States have pursued international harmonisation of test methods and good laboratory practice. In 1979 and 1980 an international group of experts, established under the special programme on the control of chemicals, developed the \"OECD principles of good laboratory practice\" (GLP), utilising common managerial and scientific practices and experience from various national and international sources. These principles of GLP were adopted by the OECD Council in 1981, as an Annex to the Council Decision on the mutual acceptance of data in the assessment of chemicals (C(81) 30 (final)).In 1995 and 1996, a new group of experts was formed to revise and update the principles. The current document is the result of the consensus reached by that group. It cancels and replaces the original principles adopted in 1981.The purpose of these principles of good laboratory practice is to promote the development of quality test data. Comparable quality of test data forms the basis for the mutual acceptance of data among countries. If individual countries can confidently rely on test data developed in other countries, duplicative testing can be avoided, thereby saving time and resources. The application of these principles should help to avoid the creation of technical barriers to trade, and further improve the protection of human health and the environment.1. ScopeThese principles of good laboratory practice should be applied to the non-clinical safety testing of test items contained in pharmaceutical products, pesticide products, cosmetic products, veterinary drugs as well as food additives, feed additives, and industrial chemicals. These test items are frequently synthetic chemicals, but may be of natural or biological origin and, in some circumstances, may be living organisms. The purpose of testing these test items is to obtain data on their properties and/or their safety with respect to human health and/or the environment.Non-clinical health and environmental safety studies covered by the principles of good laboratory practice include work conducted in the laboratory, in greenhouses, and in the field.Unless specifically exempted by national legislation, these principles of good laboratory practice apply to all non-clinical health and environmental safety studies required by regulation for the purpose of registering or licensing pharmaceuticals, pesticides, food and feed additives, cosmetic products, veterinary drug products and similar products, and for the regulation of industrial chemicals.2.

DatesExperimental starting and completion dates.4. StatementA quality assurance programme statement listing the types of inspections made and their dates, including the phase(s) inspected, and the dates any inspection results were reported to management and to the study director and principal investigator(s), if applicable. This statement would also serve to confirm that the final report reflects the raw data.5. Description of materials and test methods(a) Description of methods and materials used(b) Reference to OECD test guideline or other test guideline or method.6. Results(a) A summary of results(b) All information and data required by the study plan(c) A presentation of the results, including calculations and determinations of statistical significance(d) An evaluation and discussion of the results and, where appropriate, conclusions.7. StorageThe location(s) where the study plan, samples of test and reference items, specimens, raw data and the final report are to be stored.10. Storage and retention of records and materials10.1. The following should be retained in the archives for the period specified by the appropriate authorities:(a) the study plan, raw data, samples of test and reference items, specimens, and the final report of each study;(b) records of all inspections performed by the quality assurance programme, as well as master schedules;(c) records of qualifications, training, experience and job descriptions of personnel;(d) records and reports of the maintenance and calibration of apparatus;(e) validation documentation for computerised systems;(f) the historical file of all standard operating procedures;(g) environmental monitoring records.In the absence of a required retention period, the final disposition of any study materials should be documented. When samples of test and reference items and specimens are disposed of before the expiry of the required retention period for any reason, this should be justified and documented. Samples of test and reference items and specimens should be retained only as long as the quality of the preparation permits evaluation.10.2. Material retained in the archives should be indexed so as to facilitate orderly storage and retrieval.10.3. Only personnel authorised by management should have access to the archives. Movement of material in and out of the archives should be properly recorded.10.4. If a test facility or an archive contracting facility goes out of business and has no legal successor, the archive should be transferred to the archives of the sponsor(s) of the study(s).ANNEX IIPART ARepealed Directive and its amendment(Article 6)>TABLE>PART BDeadlines for transposition into national law(Article 6)>TABLE>ANNEX IIICorrelation table>TABLE>", "summary": "Good laboratory practice: tests on chemical substances\nGood laboratory practice: tests on chemical substances\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2004/10/EC  — rules on the application of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt codifies the EU legislation on the application of the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances and repeals Directive 87/18/EEC.\nKEY POINTS\nThe directive requires EU countries to take all measures necessary to ensure that laboratories carrying out tests on chemical products, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on the classification, packaging and labelling of chemicals and their mixtures, comply with the principles of good laboratory practice as laid down in Annex I to the directive.\nIt also applies where other EU rules provide for the application of the principles of GLP to tests on chemical products to evaluate their safety for human health and/or the environment.\nThe tests are carried out on chemical products to obtain data on their properties and their safety with regard to human health and the environment.\nWhen submitting results, laboratories must certify that the tests were carried out in accordance with the principles of good laboratory practice.\nEU countries must adopt the measures necessary to verify compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice including, in particular, inspections and checks conducted in accordance with the relevant principles of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nEU countries may not, on grounds relating to the principles of GLP, prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market of chemical products if the principles applied by the laboratories concerned comply with this directive.\nAn EU country may provisionally ban or make subject to special conditions the marketing of a chemical product on its territory, where the application of the principles of GLP and the verification of their application for tests on chemical substances show that, although it has been examined in accordance with the requirements of this directive, it presents a danger to human health or the environment.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 11 March 2004.
