Under the second sentence of that paragraph mutual legal assistance may also be made available to other, that is non-federal or local, administrative authorities. This provision however, is available at the discretion of the requested State.The Contracting Parties agree that under the first sentence of Article 8(1) mutual legal assistance will be made available to a requesting administrative authority that is, at the time of making the request, conducting investigations or proceedings in contemplation of criminal prosecution or referral of the investigated conduct to the competent prosecuting authorities, within the terms of its statutory mandate, as further described immediately below. The fact that, at the time of making the request referral for criminal prosecution is being contemplated does not exclude that, other sanctions than criminal ones may be pursued by that authority. Thus, mutual legal assistance obtained under Article 8(1) may lead the requesting administrative authority to the conclusion that pursuance of criminal proceedings or criminal referral would not be appropriate. These possible consequences do not affect the obligation upon the Contracting Parties to provide assistance under this Article.However, the requesting administrative authority may not use Article 8(1) to request assistance where criminal prosecution or referral is not being contemplated, or for matters in which the conduct under investigation is not subject to criminal sanction or referral under the laws of the requesting State.The European Union recalls that the subject matter of the Agreement for its part falls under the provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters set out in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union and that the Agreement has been concluded within the scope of these provisions.On Article 9Article 9(2)(b) is meant to ensure that refusal of assistance on data protection grounds may be invoked only in exceptional cases. Such a situation could arise if, upon balancing the important interests involved in the particular case (on the one hand, public interests, including the sound administration of justice and, on the other hand, privacy interests), furnishing the specific data sought by the requesting State would raise difficulties so fundamental as to be considered by the requested State to fall within the essential interests grounds for refusal. A broad, categorical, or systematic application of data protection principles by the requested State to refuse cooperation is therefore precluded. Thus, the fact the requesting and requested States have different systems of protecting the privacy of data (such as that the requesting State does not have the equivalent of a specialised data protection authority) or have different means of protecting personal data (such as that the requesting State uses means other than the process of deletion to protect the privacy or the accuracy of the personal data received by law enforcement authorities), may as such not be imposed as additional conditions under Article 9(2a).On Article 14Article 14 provides that the Agreement shall not preclude the conclusion, after its entry into force, of bilateral agreements on mutual legal assistance between a Member State and the United States of America consistent with the Agreement.Should any measures set forth in the Agreement create an operational difficulty for the United States of America and one or more Member States, such difficulty should in the first place be resolved, if possible, through consultations between the Member State or Member States concerned and the United States of America, or, if appropriate, through the consultation procedures set out in the Agreement. Where it is not possible to address such operational difficulty through consultations alone, it would be consistent with the Agreement for future bilateral agreements between a Member State and the United States of America to provide an operationally feasible alternative mechanism that would satisfy the objectives of the specific provision with respect to which the difficulty has arisen.", "summary": "Agreement with the United States on mutual legal assistance\nAgreement with the United States on mutual legal assistance\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement on mutual legal assistance between the EU and the US\nDecision 2009/820/CFSP on the conclusion on behalf of the EU of the Agreements on extradition and on mutual legal assistance between it and the US\nDecision 2003/516/EC on the signature of the Agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION?\nThe agreement sets out conditions relating to the provision of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between the EU and the US.\nIt seeks to enhance cooperation between EU countries and the US, as a complement to bilateral treaties concluded between EU countries and the US.\nThe decision concludes on behalf of the EU the agreement with the US relating to mutual legal assistance.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nEU countries and the US apply the conditions of this framework agreement to their bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties. In the absence of such a treaty, the EU and the US undertake to ensure that the agreement is applied.\nIn the event that existing bilateral treaties between EU countries and the US are not compatible with the agreement, the EU framework should prevail.\nMutual legal assistance\nRegarding bank information, on request of the requesting country, the requested country must promptly identify and communicate information on: whether a natural or legal person, who is suspected of or charged with a criminal offence, has one or more bank accounts;individuals or legal entities that have been convicted of or involved in a criminal offence;information that a non-bank financial institution possesses;financial transactions that are not related to bank accounts.\nEU countries’ requests for assistance are transmitted by central authorities responsible for mutual legal assistance or by national authorities responsible for investigating or prosecuting criminal offences. The US transmits its requests for assistance via its national authorities responsible for investigating or prosecuting criminal offences and which are specifically designated pursuant to Article 15(2) of the agreement.\nThe requesting country may use an expedited means of communication, such as fax or email, for the transmission of the request request for assistance and the related communications, followed by a formal confirmation if required by the requested country.\nThe requesting country may require the requested country to keep a request for assistance and its contents confidential. The central authority of the requested country must inform the requesting country if it cannot execute the request for assistance without breaching confidentiality. The requesting country must then decide whether the request for assistance should be executed or not.\nThe EU and the US must enable the establishment and operation of joint investigative teams to facilitate criminal investigations or prosecutions between one or more EU countries and the US.\nThe EU and the US must also enable video conferencing between EU countries and the US to take witnesses’ or experts’ testimonies in proceedings.\nAssistance to administrative authorities\nMutual legal assistance must also be provided to national and other administrative authorities, but only when the conduct under investigation will lead to a criminal prosecution or to a referral to criminal investigation or prosecution authorities.\nAssistance shall not be available for matters in which the administrative authority anticipates that no prosecution or referral, as applicable, will take place.\nThe authorities responsible for transmitting these requests for assistance are designated in accordance with the bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties between the countries concerned. Where such a treaty does not exist, the requests are transmitted between the US Department of Justice and the EU country’s Ministry of Justice or another equivalent ministry that is responsible for transmitting requests for mutual legal assistance.\nAssistance may not be refused on grounds of bank secrecy.\nPersonal data protection\nThe requesting country may only use the evidence or information transmitted by the requested country for: its criminal investigations and proceedings;protecting its public security against an immediate and serious threat;its non-criminal judicial or administrative proceedings that directly relate to its criminal investigations or proceedings;other purposes, provided that the information or evidence has been made public or the requested country has given its prior consent.\nThe requested country may impose additional conditions limiting the use of the evidence or information in a particular case if, due to the absence of such conditions, it was not able to comply with the particular request for assistance. In such a case, the requested country may require the requesting country to provide information on the use that it makes of the evidence or information.\nIn addition to the above limitations on use to protect personal and other data, the agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the protection of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences (EU-US Umbrella Agreement) supplements, where necessary, data protection safeguards in the agreement.\nReview of the Agreement\nIn line with Article 17 of the Agreement, the EU and the US have conducted a review of the functioning of the agreement in 2015-2016. The conclusion of the review is that, in general terms, the Agreement has been a success. The review process also resulted in recommendations to improve the practical functioning of the EU-US mutual legal assistance relationship, including on better sharing of knowledge among practitioners about each others’ laws and processes and to make better use of technology to speed up the transmission of requests and evidence and general communications.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 1 February 2010. It was implemented in EU countries by bilateral instruments.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nMutual legal assistance and extradition (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement on mutual legal assistance between the European Union and the United States of America (OJ L 181, 19.7.2003, pp. 34-42)\nCouncil Decision 2009/820/CFSP of 23 October 2009 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and the United States of America and the Agreement on mutual legal assistance between the European Union and the United States of America (OJ L 291, 7.11.2009, pp. 40-41)\nCouncil Decision 2003/516/EC of 6 June 2003 concerning the signature of the Agreements between the European Union and the United States of America on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters (OJ L 181, 19.7.2003, pp. 25-26)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the protection of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences (OJ L 336, 10.12.2016, pp. 3-13)\nInformation concerning the date of entry into force of the Agreements on Extradition and on Mutual Legal Assistance between the European Union and the United States of America (OJ L 323, 10.12.2009, p. 11)\nlast update 16.04.2019", "tags": ["agreement (EU)", "judicial cooperation", "criminal proceedings", "United States", "extradition"], "subjects": ["External relations", "Justice and home affairs", "Common foreign and security policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
