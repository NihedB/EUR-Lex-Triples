The current directive supplements this with the following:\nInformation and training\nBefore work begins, temporary workers should be informed of any risks in the job and, in particular, any special occupational qualifications, skills or special medical surveillance required.\nEach worker should receive sufficient job-appropriate training adapted to their level of qualifications and experience.\nSpecial medical surveillance\nWhere work is particularly dangerous to the safety or health of temporary workers, or requires special medical surveillance, EU countries have the option to prohibit their use. If temporary workers are used for such work, appropriate special medical surveillance must be provided by the employer, which could extend beyond the period of employment, if necessary.\nHealth and safetyservices\nHealth and safety services within an organisation must be informed of any assignment of temporary workers.\nEmployment businesses and agencies\nIf temporary workers are supplied by an agency, or other employment business, the agency must be informed of the qualifications required and the specific features of the work, and this information must be passed on to the workers concerned. The information could form part of the contract of assignment.\nThe organisation employing the temporary worker, however, is responsible for the safety, hygiene and health aspects of working conditions.\nResponsibility of EU countries\nEU countries must report to the European Commission every 5 years on its implementation, including the points of view of workers and employers.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 15 July 1991.
