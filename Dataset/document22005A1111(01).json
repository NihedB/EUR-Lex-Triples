ALLOCATION OF RIGHTSA. Each Party, subject to the terms of their own national legislation, may, by means of a contract, have non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to translate, reproduce, adapt, transmit and publicly distribute the articles, reports and technical and scientific books generated directly by the cooperative activities covered by this Agreement, provided that the legal provisions on the ownership and transfer of copyright for the creation of the work are respected.

Rights for all forms of intellectual property not described in Section II A will be allocated as follows:1. Visiting researchers, such as scientists visiting primarily in furtherance of their education, shall receive intellectual property rights under arrangements with their host institutions in accordance with the provisions of the relevant national legislation on the subject. In addition, each visiting researcher named as an inventor shall be entitled, in the same way that the researchers of the host institution are entitled, to a proportional share of any royalties received by the host institution under the licence for the use of the intellectual property.2. Regarding the intellectual property which is or may be created by joint research, the participants will draw up a joint technology management plan to be negotiated in the form of a written contract between the participants in joint research projects establishing in advance the fair and balanced distribution of results or any benefits deriving from the cooperation, considering the relative contribution of the Parties or their participants, and strictly complying with the laws on intellectual property in force in each Party and the international agreements on intellectual property to which the Parties are signatories.(a) If the Parties or their participants did not adopt a joint technology management plan in the initial phase of cooperation and if they cannot reach an agreement within a reasonable period, not more than six months, of a Party becoming aware of the creation or likely creation of the intellectual property in question as a result of the joint research, then the Parties must immediately hold discussions in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. Pending resolution of the matter, such intellectual property shall be owned jointly by the Parties or their participants, unless jointly agreed otherwise.(b) If a joint research project carried out under this Agreement leads to a creation likely to be protected by intellectual property rights which are not covered by the legislation in force in one of the Parties, the Parties must immediately hold discussions in order to find a mutually acceptable solution in accordance with the applicable legislation.III.
