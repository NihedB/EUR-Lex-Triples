CONCEPT OF ‘ORIGINATING PRODUCTS’\nArticle 2\nGeneral requirements\n1.   For the purpose of implementing the relevant Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in a Contracting Party when exported to another Contracting Party:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in the Contracting Party, within the meaning of Article 4;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in the Contracting Party incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in that Contracting Party within the meaning of Article 5;\n(c)\ngoods originating in the European Economic Area (EEA) within the meaning of Protocol 4 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Such goods shall be considered as originating in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein (1) or Norway (‘EEA Parties’) when exported respectively from the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway to a Contracting Party other than the EEA Parties.\n2.   The provisions of paragraph 1(c) shall apply only provided that free trade agreements are applicable between the importing Contracting Party and the EEA Parties.\nArticle 3\nCumulation of origin\n1.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in the exporting Contracting Party when exported to another Contracting Party if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in Switzerland (including Liechtenstein) (2), Iceland, Norway, Turkey or in the European Union, provided that the working or processing carried out in the exporting Contracting Party goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.\n2.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in the exporting Contracting Party when exported to another Contracting Party if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in the Faroe Islands, any participant in the Barcelona Process other than Turkey, or any Contracting Party other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, provided that the working or processing carried out in the exporting Contracting Party goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.\n3.   Where the working or processing carried out in the exporting Contracting Party does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 6, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the exporting Contracting Party only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other Contracting Parties referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the Contracting Party which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the exporting Contracting Party.\n4.   Products originating in the Contracting Parties referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 which do not undergo any working or processing in the exporting Contracting Party shall retain their origin if exported into one of the other Contracting Parties.\n5.   The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:\n(a)\na preferential trade agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is applicable between the Contracting Parties involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the Contracting Party of destination;\n(b)\nmaterials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Convention; and\n(c)\nnotices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in the Contracting Parties which are party to the relevant Agreements, according to their own procedures.\nThe cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).\nThe Contracting Parties shall provide the other Contracting Parties which are party to the relevant Agreements, through the European Commission, with details of the Agreements, including their dates of entry into force, which are applied with the other Contracting Parties referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.\nArticle 4\nWholly obtained products\n1.   The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in a Contracting Party when exported to another Contracting Party:\n(a)\nmineral products extracted from its soil or from its seabed;\n(b)\nvegetable products harvested there;\n(c)\nlive animals born and raised there;\n(d)\nproducts from live animals raised there;\n(e)\nproducts obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;\n(f)\nproducts of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the exporting Contracting Party by its vessels;\n(g)\nproducts made aboard its factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f);\n(h)\nused articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;\n(i)\nwaste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n(j)\nproducts extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside its territorial waters provided that it has sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;\n(k)\ngoods produced there exclusively from the products specified in (a) to (j).\n2.   The terms ‘its vessels’ and ‘its factory ships’ in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:\n(a)\nwhich are registered or recorded in the exporting Contracting Party;\n(b)\nwhich sail under the flag of the exporting Contracting Party;\n(c)\nwhich are owned to an extent of at least 50 % by nationals of the exporting Contracting Party, or by a company with its head office in the exporting Contracting Party, of which the manager or managers, Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of the exporting Contracting Party and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to the exporting Contracting Party or to public bodies or nationals of the said Contracting Party;\n(d)\nof which the master and officers are nationals of the exporting Contracting Party; and\n(e)\nof which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of the exporting Contracting Party.\n3.   For the purpose of paragraph 2 (a) and (b), when the exporting Contracting Party is the European Union, it means a Member State of the European Union.\nArticle 5\nSufficiently worked or processed products\n1.   For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained shall be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.\nThe conditions referred to above indicate the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex II, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:\n(a)\ntheir total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;\n(b)\nany of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded by virtue of this paragraph.\nThis paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 6.\nArticle 6\nInsufficient working or processing\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:\n(a)\npreserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;\n(b)\nbreaking-up and assembly of packages;\n(c)\nwashing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;\n(d)\nironing or pressing of textiles;\n(e)\nsimple painting and polishing operations;\n(f)\nhusking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;\n(g)\noperations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps;\n(h)\npeeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;\n(i)\nsharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;\n(j)\nsifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);\n(k)\nsimple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;\n(l)\naffixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n(m)\nsimple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds;\n(n)\nmixing of sugar with any material;\n(o)\nsimple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;\n(p)\na combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (n);\n(q)\nslaughter of animals.\n2.   All operations carried out in the exporting Contracting Party on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.\nArticle 7\nUnit of qualification\n1.   The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Convention shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.\nIt follows that:\n(a)\nwhen a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;\n(b)\nwhen a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Convention.\n2.   Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.\nArticle 8\nAccessories, spare parts and tools\nAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.\nArticle 9\nSets\nSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15% of the ex-works price of the set.\nArticle 10\nNeutral elements\nIn order to determine whether a product is an originating product, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:\n(a)\nenergy and fuel;\n(b)\nplant and equipment;\n(c)\nmachines and tools;\n(d)\ngoods which neither enter into the final composition of the product nor are intended to do so.\nTITLE III\nTERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS\nArticle 11\nPrinciple of territoriality\n1.   Except as provided for in Article 2(1)(c), Article 3 and paragraph 3 of this Article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall be fulfilled without interruption in the exporting Contracting Party.\n2.   Except as provided for in Article 3, where originating goods exported from a Contracting Party to another country return, they shall be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nthe returning goods are the same as those exported; and\n(b)\nthey have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.\n3.   The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the exporting Contracting Party on materials exported from the latter Contracting Party and subsequently re-imported there, provided:\n(a)\nthe said materials are wholly obtained in the exporting Contracting Party or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 prior to being exported; and\n(b)\nit can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(i)\nthe re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials; and\n(ii)\nthe total added value acquired outside the exporting Contracting Party by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed.\n4.   For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the exporting Contracting Party. However, where, in the list in Annex II, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the exporting Contracting Party, taken together with the total added value acquired outside this Contracting Party by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.\n5.   For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, ‘total added value’ means all costs arising outside the exporting Contracting Party, including the value of the materials incorporated there.\n6.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 5(2) is applied.\n7.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products of Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.\n8.   Any working or processing of the kind covered by the provisions of this Article and done outside the exporting Contracting Party shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements.\nArticle 12\nDirect transport\n1.   The preferential treatment provided for under the relevant Agreement shall apply only to products satisfying the requirements of this Convention which are transported directly between or through the territories of the Contracting Parties with which cumulation is applicable in accordance with Article 3. However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.\nOriginating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the Contracting Parties acting as exporting and importing parties.\n2.   Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party by the production of:\n(a)\na single transport document covering the passage from the exporting Contracting Party through the country of transit; or\n(b)\na certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:\n(i)\ngiving an exact description of the products;\n(ii)\nstating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used; and\n(iii)\ncertifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or\n(c)\nfailing these, any substantiating documents.\nArticle 13\nExhibitions\n1.   Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than those referred to in Article 3 with which cumulation is applicable and sold after the exhibition for importation in a Contracting Party, shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the relevant Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nan exporter has consigned these products from a Contracting Party to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;\n(b)\nthe products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in another Contracting Party;\n(c)\nthe products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and\n(d)\nthe products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.\n2.   A proof of origin shall be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party in the normal manner.

The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate.\n4.   If the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.\n5.   The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results thereof as soon as possible. These results shall indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned may be considered as products originating in one of the Contracting Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Convention.\n6.   If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.\nArticle 33\nDispute settlement\nWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 32 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, they shall be submitted to the bilateral body established by the relevant Agreement. Where disputes other than those related to the verification procedures of Article 32 arise in relation to the interpretation of this Convention, they shall be submitted to the Joint Committee.\nIn all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party shall take place under the legislation of that country.\nArticle 34\nPenalties\nPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.\nArticle 35\nFree zones\n1.   The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin, which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, when products originating in a Contracting Party are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED at the exporter’s request, if the treatment or processing undergone complies with this Convention.\n(1)  Due to the Customs Union between Liechtenstein and Switzerland, products originating in Liechtenstein are cosidered as originating in Switzerland.\n(2)  The Principality of Liechtenstein has a customs union with Switzerland and is a Contracting Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area..\nANNEX I\nIntroductory notes to the list in Annex II\nNote 1:\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of this Appendix.\nNote 2:\n2.1.\nThe first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ’ex’, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n2.2.\nWhere several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.\n2.3.\nWhere there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.\n2.4.\nWhere, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.\nNote 3:\n3.1.\nThe provisions of Article 5 of this Appendix, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Contracting Party.\nExample:\nAn engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging’ of heading ex 7224.\nIf this forging has been forged in the European Union from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the European Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.\n3.2.\nThe rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\n3.3.\nWithout prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading’, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.\nHowever, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.\n3.4.\nWhen a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\nExample:\nThe rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.\n3.5.\nWhere a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).\nExample:\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.\nHowever, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\nExample:\nIn the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth – even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is, the fibre stage.\n3.6.\nWhere, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.\nNote 4:\n4.1.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.\n4.2.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.\n4.3.\nThe terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n4.4.\nThe term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.\nNote 5:\n5.1.\nWhere, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4).\n5.2.\nHowever, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n—\nsilk,\n—\nwool,\n—\ncoarse animal hair,\n—\nfine animal hair,\n—\nhorsehair,\n—\ncotton,\n—\npaper-making materials and paper,\n—\nflax,\n—\ntrue hemp,\n—\njute and other textile bast fibres,\n—\nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,\n—\ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,\n—\nsynthetic man-made filaments,\n—\nartificial man-made filaments,\n—\ncurrent-conducting filaments,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),\n—\nother synthetic man-made staple fibres,\n—\nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n—\nother artificial man-made staple fibres,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,\n—\nproducts of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,\n—\nother products of heading 5605.\nExample:\nA yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.\nExample:\nA woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.\nExample:\nTufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\nExample:\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.\n5.3.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.\n5.4.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.\nNote 6:\n6.1.\nWhere, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.\n6.2.\nWithout prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.\nExample:\nIf a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\n6.3.\nWhere a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\nNote 7:\n7.1.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation.\n7.2.\nFor the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation;\n(j)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n(k)\nin respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n(l)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n(m)\nin respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;\n(n)\nin respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;\n(o)\nin respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0.75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.\n7.3.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.\nANNEX II\nList of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order for the product manufactured to obtain originating status\nHS heading\nDescription of product\nWorking or processing, carried out on non-originating materials, which confers originating status\n(1)\n(2)\n(3) or (4)\nChapter 1\nLive animals\nAll the animals of Chapter 1 shall be wholly obtained\nChapter 2\nMeat and edible meat offal\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapters 1 and 2 used are wholly obtained\nChapter 3\nFish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapter 3 used are wholly obtained\nex Chapter 4\nDairy produce;

Where, pursuant to this provision, the originating products are obtained in two or more of the countries concerned, they shall be considered as originating in the European Union only if the working or processing goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 of Appendix I.\nArticle 3\nCumulation in Algeria\nFor the purpose of implementing Article 2(1)(b) of Appendix I, working or processing carried out in the European Union, in Morocco or Tunisia shall be considered as having been carried out in Algeria when the products obtained undergo subsequent working or processing in Algeria. Where, pursuant to this provision, the originating products are obtained in two or more of the countries concerned, they shall be considered as originating in Algeria only if the working or processing goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 of Appendix I.\nArticle 4\nProofs of origin\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 16(4) and (5) of Appendix I, a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Member State of the European Union or of Algeria if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the European Union or in Algeria, with application of the cumulation referred to in Articles 2 and 3 of this Annex, and fulfil the other requirements of Appendix I.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 21(2) and (3) of Appendix I, an origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the European Union or in Algeria, with application of the cumulation referred to in Articles 2 and 3 of this Annex, and fulfil the other requirements of Appendix I.\nArticle 5\nSupplier’s declarations\n1.   When a movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, or an origin declaration is made out, in the European Union or Algeria for originating products, in the manufacture of which goods coming from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia or the European Union which have undergone working or processing in these countries without having obtained preferential originating status, have been used, account shall be taken of the supplier’s declaration given for those goods in accordance with this Article.\n2.   The supplier’s declaration referred to in paragraph 1 shall serve as evidence of the working or processing undergone in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia or the European Union by the goods concerned for the purpose of determining whether the products in the manufacture of which those goods are used, may be considered as products originating in the European Union or Algeria and fulfil the other requirements of Appendix I.\n3.   A separate supplier’s declaration shall, except in the cases provided in paragraph 4, be made out by the supplier for each consignment of goods in the form prescribed in Annex A on a sheet of paper annexed to the invoice, the delivery note or any other commercial document describing the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.\n4.   Where a supplier regularly supplies a particular customer with goods for which the working or processing undergone in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia or the European Union is expected to remain constant for considerable periods of time, he may provide a single supplier’s declaration to cover subsequent consignments of those goods (hereinafter referred to as a ‘long-term supplier’s declaration’).\nA long-term supplier’s declaration may normally be valid for a period of up to one year from the date of making out the declaration. The customs authorities of the country where the declaration is made out lay down the conditions under which longer periods may be used.\nThe long-term supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier in the form prescribed in Annex B and shall describe the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. It shall be provided to the customer concerned before he is supplied with the first consignment of goods covered by that declaration or together with his first consignment.\nThe supplier shall inform his customer immediately if the long-term supplier’s declaration is no longer applicable to the goods supplied.\n5.   The supplier’s declarations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be typed or printed using one of the languages in which the Agreement is drawn up, in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the country where the declaration is made out, and shall bear the original signature of the supplier in manuscript. The declaration may also be handwritten; in such a case, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.\n6.   The supplier making out a declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the country where the declaration is made out, all appropriate documents proving that the information given on that declaration is correct.\nArticle 6\nSupporting documents\nSupplier’s declarations proving the working or processing undergone in the European Union, Algeria, Morocco or Tunisia by materials used, made out in one of these countries, shall be treated as a document referred to in Articles 16(3) and 21(5) of Appendix I and Article 5(6) of this Annex used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an origin declaration may be considered as products originating in the European Union or in Algeria and fulfil the other requirements of Appendix I.\nArticle 7\nPreservation of supplier’s declarations\nThe supplier making out a supplier’s declaration shall keep for at least three years copies of the declaration and of all the invoices, delivery notes or other commercial documents to which that declaration is annexed as well as the documents referred to in Article 5(6).\nThe supplier making out a long-term supplier’s declaration shall keep for at least three years copies of the declaration and of all the invoices, delivery notes or other commercial documents concerning goods covered by that declaration sent to the customer concerned, as well as the documents referred to in Article 5(6). This period shall begin from the date of expiry of validity of the long-term supplier’s declaration.\nArticle 8\nAdministrative cooperation\nIn order to ensure the proper application of this Annex, the European Union and Algeria shall assist each other, through the competent customs authorities, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1, the origin declarations or the supplier’s declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.\nArticle 9\nVerification of supplier’s declarations\n1.   Subsequent verifications of supplier’s declarations or long-term supplier’s declarations may be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the country where such declarations have been taken into account to issue a movement certificate EUR.1 or to make out an origin declaration, have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or the correctness of the information given in this document.\n2.   For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the country referred to in paragraph 1 shall return the supplier’s declaration or the long-term supplier’s declaration and invoices, delivery notes or other commercial documents concerning goods covered by such declaration, to the customs authorities of the country where the declaration was made out, giving, where appropriate, the reasons of substance or form of the request for verification.\nThey shall forward, in support of the request for subsequent verification, any documents and information that have been obtained suggesting that the information given in the supplier’s declaration or the long-term supplier’s declaration is incorrect.\n3.   The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the country where the supplier’s declaration or the long-term supplier’s declaration was made out. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and carry out any inspection of the supplier’s accounts or any other check which they consider appropriate.\n4.

The convention brings together in a single legal instrument all the rules regarding the origin of goods traded in the context of approximately 60 bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) between countries of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area including the EU’s Stabilisation and Association process (SAP).\nContracting parties\nBesides the EU, the contracting parties to this convention are:\nthe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland;\nsignatories to the Barcelona declaration: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey;\nthe Faroes;\nparticipants in the SAP process: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Kosovo (1);\nthe Republic of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine.\nOriginating products\nFor tariff preferences to be applied, the origin of goods has to be established. Goods are considered as products originating in the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation zone if they are:\nwholly obtained (e.g. mined, harvested or, in the case of live animals, born and raised) in the territory of a contracting party;\ncomposed of materials originating in countries that are not signatories to the convention (non-originating materials), but which have been sufficiently worked or processed in the territory of a contracting party (Annex II of Appendix I);\nimported from the European Economic Area (EEA) and exported to another contracting party.\nPan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation zone\nThe convention operates on the basis of an accumulation system whereby contracting parties can use originating products from each other as though they were domestically produced. Under the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin system, a system of diagonal cumulation operates between the EU and many of the countries in question.\nProof of origin\nCustoms authorities of the exporting country issue movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED as proof of claims of origin. This allows importers in other contracting parties to benefit from the preferential tariff arrangements.\nAn origin declaration or an origin declaration EUR-MED may also be given by an approved exporter.\nArrangements for administrative cooperation\nThe parties’ customs authorities will coordinate with one another (e.g. by sharing specimen impressions of stamps used for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED or for verifying proofs of origin.)\nManagement and implementation\nA joint committee made up of representatives of all the contracting parties ensures the management and implementation of the convention.\n(1) This designation is without prejudice to positions on status and is in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 26 March 2012.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nPan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nRules of origin: effectively the ‘economic’ nationality of goods traded which has to be determined in order to decide how they are treated in terms of customs duties. Preferential origin is conferred on goods from particular countries that have met certain criteria such as undergoing more working or processing than is required to obtain non-preferential origin.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2013/94/EU of 26 March 2012 on the conclusion of the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (OJ L 54, 26.2.2013, pp. 3-158)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2013/93/EU of 14 April 2011 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (OJ L 54, 26.2.2013, pp. 1-2)\nlast update 09.02.2018", "tags": ["Faroe Islands", "EFTA countries", "originating product", "ratification of an agreement", "international convention", "trade agreement (EU)", "Mediterranean third countries", "stabilisation and association agreement"], "subjects": ["External relations", "Commercial policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
