OWNERSHIP, ALLOCATION AND EXERCISE OF RIGHTS\n1.\nAll research carried out pursuant to this Agreement shall be ‘joint research’. The participants performing the joint research shall develop Joint Technology Management Plans (JTMPs) which shall contain, as a minimum, principles in respect of the ownership and use, including publication, of information and Intellectual Property (IP) to be created in the course of the joint research (1). The JTMPs may be reviewed by the Parties and shall be approved by the responsible funding agency or department of the Party involved in financing the research, before the conclusion of any specific research and development cooperation contracts to which they refer. The JTMPs shall be developed taking into account the aims of the joint research, the relative contributions of the participants, the advantages and disadvantages of licensing by territory or for fields of use, requirements imposed by applicable laws, the need for dispute settlement procedures and other factors deemed appropriate by the participants. The rights and obligations concerning the research and information generated by visiting researchers in respect of IP shall also be addressed in the JTMPs.\n2.\nInformation or IP created in the course of joint research and not addressed in a JTMP shall be allocated following the procedures set out in I,1 according to the principles set out in that JTMP. In case of disagreement, which cannot be resolved by the agreed dispute resolution procedure, such unallocated information or IP shall be owned jointly by all the participants involved in the joint research from which the information or IP results, and each participant to whom this provision applies shall have the right to use such information or IP for his/her own commercial exploitation with no geographical limitation.\n3.\nIn accordance with applicable laws, each Party shall ensure that the other Party and its participants may have the rights to IP allocated to them in accordance with the principles set out in section I of this Annex.\n4.\nWhile maintaining the conditions of competition in areas affected by the Agreement, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that rights acquired pursuant to the Agreement, and arrangements made under it, are exercised in such a way as to encourage in particular:\n(i)\nthe dissemination and use of information created, disclosed, or otherwise made available, under the Agreement;\n(ii)\nthe adoption and implementation of international standards.\nII.   COPYRIGHT WORKS\nCopyright belonging to the Parties or to their participants shall be accorded treatment consistent with the Berne Convention (Paris Act 1971).\nIII.   SCIENTIFIC LITERARY WORKS\nWithout prejudice to Section IV, unless otherwise agreed in the JTMP, any publication of results of the joint research shall be made jointly by the participants. In addition to the foregoing general rule, the following procedure shall apply:\n1.\nIn the case of publication by a Party or public bodies of that Party of scientific and technical journals, articles, reports, books, including video and software, arising from joint research pursuant to the Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled, with written permission from the publisher, to a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to translate, reproduce, adapt, transmit and publicly distribute such works.\n2.\nThe Parties shall endeavour to disseminate literary works of a scientific character arising from joint research pursuant to the Agreement and published by independent publishers as widely as possible.\n3.\nAll copies of a copyright work to be publicly distributed and prepared under this provision shall indicate the names of the author(s) of the work unless an author or authors expressly declines or decline to be named. Copies shall also bear a clearly visible acknowledgement of the cooperative support of the Parties.\nIV.   UNDISCLOSED INFORMATION\nA.   Documentary undisclosed information\n1.\nEach Party or its participants shall identify at the earliest possible moment, and preferably in the JTMP, the information that it wishes to remain undisclosed in relation to this Agreement, taking into account, among other things, the following criteria:\n—\nsecrecy of the information in the sense that the information, is not, as a body or in the precise configuration or assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible by lawful means to experts in the field;\n—\nthe actual or potential commercial value of the information by virtue of its secrecy;\n—\nprevious protection of the information in the sense that it has been subject to steps that were reasonable under the circumstances by the person lawfully in control, to maintain its secrecy.\n2.\nParticipants shall not normally be required to provide undisclosed information to the Parties. Should the Parties become aware of such information, they shall respect the privileged nature thereof, and it shall not be further disclosed by, within, or between the Parties, without the written consent of the participant(s) to whom the information belongs. These limitations shall automatically terminate when such information is disclosed by the owner, without restriction, to experts in the field.\n3.\nEach Party shall ensure that undisclosed information, communicated between them under the Agreement, and its ensuant privileged nature is readily recognizable as such by the other Party, for example, by means of an appropriate marking or restrictive legend. This also applies to any reproduction of the said information, in whole or in part.\n4.\nUndisclosed information communicated under the Agreement, and received from the other Party, may be disseminated by the receiving Party to persons within or employed by the receiving Party and other concerned departments or agencies of the receiving Party authorized for the specific purposes of the joint research underway, provided that any undisclosed information so disseminated shall be pursuant to a written agreement of confidentiality and shall be readily recognizable as such, as set out above.\n5.\nWith the prior written consent of the Party providing undisclosed information under the Agreement, the receiving Party may disseminate such undisclosed information more widely than otherwise permitted in Paragraph 3 above. The Parties shall cooperate in developing procedures for requesting and obtaining prior written consent for such wider dissemination, and each Party will grant such approval to the extent permitted by its domestic policies, regulations and laws.\nB.   Non-documentary undisclosed information\nNon-documentary undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information provided in seminars and other meetings arranged under the Agreement, or information arising from the attachment of staff, use of facilities, or joint projects, shall be treated by the Parties or their participants according to the principles specified in point A above, provided, however, that the recipient of such undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information has been made aware in advance and in written form of the confidential character of the information to be communicated.\nC.   Control\nEach Party shall make its best efforts to ensure that undisclosed information received by it under the Agreement shall be controlled as provided therein. If one of the Parties becomes aware that it will be, or may reasonably be expected to become, unable to meet the non-dissemination provisions of points A and B above, it shall immediately inform the Party likely to be affected by the dissemination. The Parties involved shall thereafter consult to define an appropriate course of action.\n(1)  The indicative features of such JTMPs are set out in the Appendix.\nAppendix\nINDICATIVE FEATURES OF A JOINT TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PLAN (JTMP)\nThe JTMP is a specific contract to be concluded between the participants in joint research defining their respective rights and obligations. With respect to intellectual Property Rights, the JTMP will normally address, inter alia: ownership, protection, user rights for research and development purposes, exploitation and dissemination, including arrangements for joint publication, the rights and obligations of visiting researchers and dispute settlement procedures. The JTMP may also address foreground and background information, the rules governing disclosure of undisclosed information, licensing and deliverables.", "summary": "Scientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Canada\nScientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Canada\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and Canada\nCouncil Decision 96/219/EC on the conclusion of the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and Canada\nAgreement amending the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and Canada\nCouncil Decision 1999/408/EC on the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between the European Community and Canada\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISION?\n              \nThe agreement establishes a formal framework for cooperation aiming at encouraging and facilitating activities in science and technology fields of common interest.\nThe decision adopts the agreement on behalf of the European Community (now the EU).\nKEY POINTS\n              \nActivities conducted under the agreement are based on:\nmutual benefit;\ntimely exchange of information;\nbalanced realisation of economic and social benefits by the EU and Canada;\neffective protection of intellectual property and fair sharing of intellectual property rights.\nFields of cooperation\nFor the EU, these include all research and technological development and demonstration activities covered by:\nArticle 180(a) of the TFEU — Implementation of research, technological development and demonstration programmes, by promoting cooperation with and between undertakings, research centres and universities;
