Challenges are common and responses need to be coordinated.\n(2)\nDue to its geographical position Turkey is a major first reception and transit country for migrants that will by the end of 2015 be hosting more than 2 million of asylum seekers and refugees, the highest number in the world. Turkey is making commendable efforts to provide massive humanitarian aid and support to an unprecedented and continuously increasing influx of people seeking refuge and has already spent more than EUR 7 billion of its own resources on addressing this crisis.\n(3)\nTurkey and the EU are determined to confront and surmount the existing challenges in a concerted manner. To this end, a policy document reflecting the understanding between the European Union and the Republic of Turkey to step up their cooperation on support of Syrians under temporary protection and migration management in a coordinated effort to address the crisis (hereinafter: ‘the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan’), agreed ad referendum by Turkey on 15 October 2015, aims to address the refugee crisis and migration management. The European Council Conclusions the same day welcomed ‘the joint Action Plan with Turkey as a part of a comprehensive cooperation based on shared responsibility, mutual commitments and delivery’ and stated that ‘the EU and its Member States stand ready to increase cooperation with Turkey and step up their political and financial engagement substantially within the established framework’.\n(4)\nAs foreseen in the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan, the EU needs to mobilise substantial new financial resources, in a sustained and responsive manner to assist Turkey in addressing the emerging needs and coping with the challenge represented by the presence of Syrians under temporary protection. The funds should be mobilised in the most flexible and rapid way possible. The identification of the priorities and the areas where they should be allocated should be decided in consultation with the Turkish authorities, except for actions providing immediate humanitarian assistance. Priority will be given to immediate humanitarian, development and other assistance to refugees and host communities, national and local authorities in managing and addressing the consequences of the inflows of refugees should be provided.\n(5)\nThe European Union and Member States budgets have so far mobilised a total of EUR 3,6 billion since the start of the Syrian conflict (around EUR 1,6 billion from the Union budget and EUR 2,0 billion from Member States), making them the main world donor in addressing the consequences of this crisis. This assistance has allowed for urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance and supported the national and local capacities to deliver services for those affected by the crisis (education, health, basic services such as water and waste management services, support to livelihoods). However, the various European Union instruments and Member States’ programmes work in parallel through various bilateral channels (United Nations (UN) agencies, Non-Governmental Organisations, national agencies, host country governments).\n(6)\nTitle III of Part Five of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) concerns, inter alia, development cooperation with third countries and humanitarian aid. The exercise of the Union’s competence in these areas does not result in Member States being prevented from exercising their competence, in accordance with Article 4(4) TFEU.\n(7)\nTurkey is included in the OECD Development Assistance Committee’s list of Official Development Assistance recipient countries as ‘upper middle income country’.\n(8)\nPursuant to Article 210(1) TFEU the Union and the Member States shall coordinate their respective policies and shall consult each other. An increased coordination is therefore needed. In accordance with Articles 210(2) and 214(6) TFEU, the Commission may take any useful initiative to promote coordination between actions of the Union and those of the Member States, in order to enhance the efficiency and complementarity of Union and national aid measures.\n(9)\nThe overall objective of the Turkey Facility is to coordinate and streamline actions financed from the Union’s budget and bilateral contributions from Member States in order to enhance the efficiency and complementarity of support provided to refugees and host communities in Turkey.\n(10)\nEU and Member States assistance shall enable a comprehensive response commensurate to the challenges. This response should contribute to mitigating the consequences of the refugee influx both for the refugees and for Turkey as a host country. It should bring together funds and actions from the EU and its Member States to address the needs in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.\n(11)\nEU instruments currently used in response to the Syrian crisis, such as the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (1), the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) (2), the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II) (3), the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) (4) and funding under Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 concerning humanitarian aid (5) may contribute to the Turkey Facility within the limits laid down in the multiannual financial framework 2014-20. Any humanitarian assistance under the Turkey Facility shall be administered and provided in full respect for humanitarian principles and the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid (6).\n(12)\nActions and measures to be financed by the Union’s budget will be implemented in accordance with its financial rules and regulations — which includes both direct and indirect management and Union trust funds as one of the implementing tools foreseen in line with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2014 laying down common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for financing external action (7).\n(13)\nThe Commission acknowledges the expressed intentions of the Member States to contribute EUR 2 500 000 000 out of a total amount of EUR 3 000 000 000. The Commission invites Member States to commit formally their financial share in line with the breakdown described in the Annex which uses the GNI-key.\n(14)\nThe Commission notes that there is currently a ‘windfall’ of ‘other revenue’ and customs duties of EUR 2 300 000 000 in the 2015 EU budget; this revenue comes from a higher level of collected competition fines, revenues from investments and loans granted, penalties, late payment interests and higher than expected customs duties. This amount of EUR 2 300 000 000 is part of draft amending budget 8/2015 recently adopted by the European Parliament and Council. These windfall revenues from the 2015 budget will be deducted from the contributions of the Member States to the EU Budget.\n(15)\nFinancial contributions from Member States should be included into the Union’s budget as external assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(2)(b) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (8),\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nEstablishment of the Refugee Facility for Turkey\nThis Decision establishes a coordination mechanism — the Refugee Facility for Turkey (‘the Facility’) — to assist Turkey in addressing the immediate humanitarian and development needs of the refugees and their host communities, national and local authorities in managing and addressing the consequences of the inflow of refugees.\nArticle 2\nObjectives of the Facility\n1.

It sets up the Refugee Facility for Turkey (the ‘Facility’).\nDecision C(2016) 855 amends Decision C(2015) 9500, clarifying the scope of actions, other than humanitarian assistance, the Facility will coordinate, as well as the role and operation of the Facility’s steering committee. It also modifies the split of allocations between the general budget of the EU and EU countries’ contributions.\nDecision C(2017) 2293 amends Decision C(2015) 9500, clarifying that no interest is due for the late payment by an EU country of a contribution to the Facility.\nDecision C(2018) 1500 amends Decision C(2015) 9500, granting an additional tranche of €3 billion for the Facility as stated in the EU-Turkey Statement of March 2016.\nKEY POINTS OF THE 2015 DECISION\nTo assist Turkey in addressing the immediate humanitarian and development needs of the refugees, their host communities, national and local authorities a coordination mechanism is established: the Refugee Facility.\nThe Facility’s objective is to ensure that actions financed with financial contributions from the EU countries and the general budget of the EU are properly coordinated and streamlined.\nThe budget set for the Facility is €3 billion, comprising: €0.5 billion from the EU budget; and€2.5 billion in the form of contributions from the EU countries as external assigned revenue*, according to a breakdown set in the annex to the decision and based on the Gross National Income Key*.\nThe European Commission coordinates the Facility by setting priorities for the allocation of resources.\nThe Facility is led by a steering committee providing strategic guidance. This committee is composed of two Commission representatives and a representative from each EU country, as well as a representative of Turkey in an advisory capacity. The Commission chairs the committee and provides its secretariat.\nThe Commission is responsible for managing the Facility in compliance with the relevant EU legislation providing the legal basis for the respective actions and their implementation.\nAmendments in 2016, 2017 and 2018\nThe decision was amended in 2016 by Decision C/2016/855:\nThe mechanism is renamed ‘Facility for Refugees in Turkey’.\nIt clarifies the types of measures to refugees that may be coordinated through the Facility. These include humanitarian assistance;education;health;socio-economic support;migration management; andmunicipal infrastructure.\nThe role and functioning of the steering committee is further detailed.\nThe Facility’s budget is revised as follows: within the €3 billion budget, the share of the contribution from the general EU budget is increased to one third;the share of the EU countries is reduced to €2 billion;the breakdown of contributions between EU countries is based on the Gross National Income Key used for the 2015 budget (the annex has been deleted).\nBecause the decision still referred to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the EU’s general budget, the decision was amended a second time in 2017 by Decision C(2017) 2293. It clarifies that:\nEU countries’ contributions to the Facility are voluntary and, unlike in the case of the EU’s own resources (i.e. the EU budget’s main sources of revenue), do not correspond to a pre-existing obligation;\nas an exception to the financial rules that apply to the EU’s general budget, no interest is due for the late payment by an EU country of a contribution to the Facility.\nIn 2018, the decision was amended again further to the undertaking by the EU in the 2016 EU-Turkey Statement to mobilise a further €3 billion under the Facility for Refugees, under certain conditions, because the initially allocated €3 billion were about to be used to the full. This second tranche — to ensure the continuity of the Facility’s work for the 2018–2019 period — would follow the same pattern of distribution (i.e. €2 billion from EU countries and €1 billion from the EU budget).\nReports\nThe Commission publishes annual reports on the Facility’s operations.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS APPLY?\nDecision C(2015) 9500 has applied since 1 January 2016.\nDecision C(2016 855 has applied since 7 March 2016.\nDecision C(2017) 2293 has applied retroactively from 10 February 2016, in order to cover the contributions already made by EU countries.\nDecision C(2018) 1500 has applied since 14 March 2018.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEU Facility for Refugees in Turkey (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nRefugees: people forced to leave their country and seek refuge from conflicts, violence, human rights violations, persecutions and natural disasters.\nExternal assigned revenue: funds that are not part of the EU budget and come separately from the parties participating in the Facility.\nGross National Income Key: a matrix containing countries’ Gross National Income data which is used to determine fair burden-sharing.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Decision C(2018)1500 of 14 March 2018 on the Facility for Refugees in Turkey amending Commission Decision C(2015) 9500 as regards the contribution to the Facility for Refugees in Turkey (OJ C 106, 21.3.2018, pp. 4-6)\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council — Second Annual Report on the Facility for Refugees in Turkey (COM(2018) 91 final, 14.3.2018)\nCommission Decision C(2017) 2293 of 18 April 2017 on the Facility for Refugees in Turkey amending Commission Decision C(2015) 9500 of 24 November 2015 (OJ C 122, 19.4.2017, pp. 4-5)\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council — First Annual Report on the Facility for Refugees in Turkey (COM(2017) 130 final, 2.3.2017)\nCommission Decision C(2016) 855 of 10 February 2016 on the Facility for Refugees in Turkey, amending Commission Decision C(2015) 9500 of 24 November 2015 (OJ C 60, 16.2.2016, pp. 3-6)\nCommission Decision C(2015) 9500 of 24 November 2015 on the coordination of the actions of the Union and of the Member States through a coordination mechanism — the Refugee Facility for Turkey (OJ C 407, 8.12.2015, pp. 8-13)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision C(2015) 9500 have been incorporated into the original text.
