{"celex_id": "32018R1091", "reference": "7.8.2018\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 200/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2018/1091 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 18 July 2018\non integrated farm statistics and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1166/2008 and (EU) No 1337/2011\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 1166/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) establishes a framework for European statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings up to 2016. That Regulation should therefore be repealed.\n(2)\nThe programme of European surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings, which has been carried out in the Union since 1966, should be continued in order to examine the trends in the structure of agricultural holdings at the Union level and to provide the statistical knowledge base necessary for the design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review of related policies, in particular the common agricultural policy (CAP), including rural development measures, as well as environmental, climate change adaptation and mitigation and land use policies of the Union and some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Such a knowledge base is also required in order to estimate the impact of those policies on the female workforce on agricultural holdings.\n(3)\nThe collection of statistical data, in particular concerning the structure of farms, should aim, amongst other objectives, to inform the decision-making process with updated data with a view to future CAP reforms.\n(4)\nAn international evaluation of agricultural statistics led to setting up the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics that was endorsed by the United Nations Statistics Committee (UNSC) in 2010. European agricultural statistics should, where appropriate, follow the recommendations of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics, as well as those of the FAO World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2020.\n(5)\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) provides for a framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, based on common statistical principles. It establishes quality criteria, and refers to the need to minimise the response burden on survey respondents and to contribute to the more general objective of a reduction of administrative burdens.\n(6)\nA multipurpose statistical programme on agricultural holdings should be set up for the next decade to provide the framework for harmonised, comparable and coherent statistics. Those statistics should be targeted towards policy needs.\n(7)\nThe Strategy for Agricultural Statistics for 2020 and beyond, set up by the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) in November 2015, envisages the adoption of two framework Regulations covering all aspects of agricultural statistics, with the exception of the Economic Accounts for Agriculture. This Regulation is one of those framework Regulations.\n(8)\nFor the purposes of harmonisation and comparability of information on the structure of agricultural holdings and in order to meet the current needs of the Single Common Market Organisation and in particular the fruit and wine sector, Regulation (EU) No 1337/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) should be integrated with the structural information at the level of agricultural holdings from 2023 onwards and replaced by this Regulation. It is therefore necessary to repeal that Regulation.\n(9)\nComparable statistics from all Member States on the structure of agricultural holdings are important to determine the development of the CAP. Therefore standard classifications and common definitions should be used insofar as possible for variables.\n(10)\nThe statistical data records relating to agricultural holdings enable core and module data to be cross-tabulated, therefore allowing for information to be retrieved based on variables such as the gender of the manager of the agricultural holding, that manager's age, the ownership structure and size of the agricultural holding and the uptake of environmental measures. A disaggregation of results will be possible for the criteria included in the core data and for combinations of criteria.\n(11)\nThe collection of information on year of birth, year when classified as manager of the agricultural holding and gender could provide data for the development of actions in respect of generational renewal and gender-related aspects.\n(12)\nAmongst other reasons, for the purposes of updating the basic registers of agricultural holdings and the rest of the information required for the stratification of samples, a census of agricultural holdings should be carried out in the Union at least every 10 years. The most recent census took place in 2009/2010.\n(13)\nMember States in which the periods of fieldwork for the survey reference year 2020 overlap with the work planned for the 10-year population census should have the possibility to bring the farming survey forward a year so as to avoid the heavy burden of conducting two major data collections at the same time.\n(14)\nIn order to avoid placing an unnecessary burden on agricultural holdings and national administrations, thresholds should be established. Properly analysing the structure of European agriculture requires that 98 % of the utilised agricultural area and the livestock on farms should be covered by the statistics. In some Member States, this means that the thresholds listed in this Regulation are too high. However, the agricultural holdings below those thresholds are so small that a sample data collection to be carried out once per decade is sufficient to allow the estimation of their structure and the impact on production, resulting in the reduction of costs and burdens while still enabling the design of effective policy action to support and maintain small farming structures.\n(15)\nThe areas used for agricultural production should be covered by integrated farm statistics, including the land used by two or more agricultural holdings because common rights apply.\n(16)\nIt is necessary to receive information about the affiliation of an agricultural holding to a group of enterprises, the entities of which are controlled by a parent entity.\n(17)\nIn order to reduce the burden on respondents, the National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) and other national authorities should have access to administrative data, to the extent that those data are necessary for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, in accordance with Article 17a of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.\n(18)\nMember States or responsible national authorities should endeavour to modernise data collection modes on agricultural holdings insofar as possible. The use of digital solutions in that regard should be promoted.\n(19)\nFor the purposes of flexibility for the European agricultural statistical system, and for the simplification and modernisation of agricultural statistics, the variables to be collected should be allocated to different collection groups (core data and modules) varying in frequency or representativeness, or both.\n(20)\nThe response burden and costs can be further reduced by reusing data from the year directly preceding or following the reference year. This would be particularly relevant for aspects where no large changes are expected from one year to the next.\n(21)\nFor the purpose of flexibility and to reduce the burden on respondents, the NSIs and other national authorities, the Member States should be allowed to use statistical surveys, administrative records and any other sources, methods or innovative approaches including scientifically based and well documented methods such as imputation, estimation and modelling.\n(22)\nThe collection of information on nutrient and water use and agricultural production methods applied on agricultural holdings should be improved in order to provide additional statistics for the development of agro-environmental policy and to enhance the quality of agro-environmental indicators.\n(23)\nFor geocoding of agricultural holdings, the Statistical Units theme in accordance with Annex III to Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) should be used.\n(24)\nThe Commission is to respect the confidentiality of the data transmitted in line with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. The necessary protection of confidentiality of data should be ensured, among other means, by limiting the use of the location parameters to spatial analysis of information and by appropriate aggregation when publishing statistics. For that reason, a harmonised approach to the protection of confidentiality and quality aspects for data dissemination should be developed while making efforts to render online access to official statistics easy and user-friendly.\n(25)\nAny processing of personal data under this Regulation is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and provisions adopted in accordance with that Regulation, and/or Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), as the case may be.\n(26)\nRegulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) establishes the statistical classification of economic activities in the Union referred to in this Regulation for the purpose of defining the relevant population of agricultural holdings.\n(27)\nIn accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), territorial units should be defined in accordance with the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) classification.\n(28)\nFunding should be required from both the Member States and the Union over a number of years in order to carry out the data collection. Provision should therefore be made for a Union grant to support that programme through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund under Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(29)\nThis Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the entire duration of the relevant multiannual financial framework (MFF) which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management (11), for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure. This Regulation makes a provision for establishing the budget for further data collections in the context of the subsequent MFF.\n(30)\nEconomic aspects of this Regulation should be reviewed for the period post-2020 taking into account the new MFF and other relevant changes to Union instruments. Based on that review, the Commission should consider proposing relevant changes to this Regulation.\n(31)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the systematic production of European statistics on agricultural holdings in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, for reasons of consistency and comparability, be better achieved at the Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(32)\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 provides for a reference framework for European statistics and requires Member States to comply with the statistical principles and quality criteria specified in that Regulation. Quality reports are essential for assessing, improving and communicating on the quality of European statistics. The ESSC has endorsed a European Statistical System (ESS) standard for Quality Reports Structure, in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. That ESS standard should contribute to the harmonisation of quality reporting under this Regulation.\n(33)\nAn impact assessment has been performed in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, in order to focus the statistical programme established by this Regulation on the need for effectiveness in achieving the objectives and in order to incorporate budgetary constraints from the design phase onwards.\n(34)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of specifying the descriptions of variables listed in this Regulation and the technical elements of the data to be provided, establishing the descriptions of the variables and other practical arrangements for the collection of ad-hoc data as laid down in this Regulation, as well as setting out the practical arrangements for and contents of the quality reports. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). When exercising those powers, the Commission should take into account aspects such as cost and administrative burdens on agricultural holdings and Member States.\n(35)\nIn order to take into account emerging data needs mainly stemming from new developments in agriculture, revised legislation and changing policy priorities, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the detailed topics listed in this Regulation and supplementing the relevant module data by specifying the information to be provided on an ad-hoc basis as set out in this Regulation. In order to provide for compatibility and facilitate the use of other data sources, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the variables listed in this Regulation. When exercising that power, the Commission should take into account aspects such as cost and administrative burdens on agricultural holdings and Member States. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (13). In particular, in order to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(36)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor has been consulted and adopted an opinion on 20 November 2017 (14).\n(37)\nThe ESSC has been consulted,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a framework for European statistics at the level of agricultural holdings and provides for the integration of information on the structure with that on production methods, rural development measures, agro-environmental aspects and other related information.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘farm’ or ‘agricultural holding’ means a single unit, both technically and economically, that has a single management and that undertakes economic activities in agriculture in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 belonging to groups A.01.1, A.01.2, A.01.3, A.01.4, A.01.5 or to the ‘maintenance of agricultural land in good agricultural and environmental condition’ of group A.01.6 within the economic territory of the Union, either as its primary or secondary activity. Regarding activities of class A.01.49, only the activities ‘Raising and breeding of semi-domesticated or other live animals’ (with the exception of raising of insects) and ‘Bee-keeping and production of honey and beeswax’ are included;\n(b)\n‘common land agricultural unit’ means an entity of land on which common rights apply and which is used by two or more agricultural holdings for agricultural production, but is not allocated amongst them;\n(c)\n‘region’ means the territorial unit of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), defined in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003;\n(d)\n‘livestock unit’ means a standard measurement unit that allows for the aggregation of the various categories of livestock in order for them to be compared; the coefficients for establishing the livestock units for individual livestock categories are listed in Annex I;\n(e)\n‘utilised agricultural area’ or ‘UAA’ means the land area used for farming, including arable land, permanent grassland, permanent crops, and other utilised agricultural land;\n(f)\n‘reference year’ means a calendar year to which the reference periods refer;\n(g)\n‘kitchen garden’ means areas used for food production intended for one's own consumption;\n(h)\n‘module’ means one or more data sets organised in order to cover topics;\n(i)\n‘topic’ means the content of the information to be collected about the statistical units, each topic covering a number of detailed topics;\n(j)\n‘detailed topic’ means the detailed content of the information to be collected about the statistical units related to a specific topic, each detailed topic covering a number of variables;\n(k)\n‘variable’ means a characteristic of a unit being observed that may assume more than one of a set of values.\nArticle 3\nCoverage\n1.   The data required by this Regulation shall cover 98 % of the total UAA (excluding kitchen gardens) and 98 % of the livestock units of each Member State.\n2.   In order to meet those requirements, Member States shall provide data representative of the agricultural holdings and common land agricultural units that meet at least one of the physical thresholds listed in Annex II with regard to the size of agricultural land or the number of livestock units.\n3.   By way of exception, where the frame specified under paragraph 2 represents more than 98 % of the national agricultural production, measured by the Standard Output in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014 (15), Member States may, subject to prior approval by the Commission (Eurostat), establish higher physical or corresponding economic thresholds to reduce the frame, as long as the 98 % coverage of the total UAA (excluding kitchen gardens) and 98 % of the livestock units of the Member States is reached.\n4.   Where the frame specified under paragraph 2 of this Article does not represent 98 % of the UAA and 98 % of the livestock units, Member States shall extend the frame in accordance with Article 6 by establishing lower thresholds than those referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, or by establishing additional thresholds, or both.\nArticle 4\nData sources and methods\n1.   For the purpose of obtaining the data referred to in this Regulation, Member States shall use one or more of the following sources or methods, provided that the information allows for the production of statistics that meet the quality requirements laid down in Article 11:\n(a)\nstatistical surveys;\n(b)\nthe administrative data sources specified in paragraph 2 of this Article;\n(c)\nother sources, methods or innovative approaches.\n2.   Member States may use information from the integrated administration and control system (IACS) established by Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals established by Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) and the system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals established by Council Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 (18), the vineyard register implemented in accordance with Article 145 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19), and the organic farming registers set up pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 (20). Member States may also use administrative sources associated with specific rural development measures.\n3.   Member States which decide to use the sources, methods or innovative approaches referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission (Eurostat) during the year preceding the reference year and shall provide details concerning the quality of the data obtained from that source, method or innovative approach and the data collection methods to be used.\n4.   National authorities responsible for fulfilling the requirements of this Regulation shall have the right to access and use data, promptly and free of charge, including individual data on agricultural holdings and personal data on their holders contained in administrative files compiled on their national territory pursuant to Article 17a of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. The national authorities and the owners of the administrative records shall establish the necessary cooperation mechanisms.\nArticle 5\nCore structural data\n1.   Member States shall collect and provide the core structural data (‘core data’) related to the agricultural holdings referred to in Article 3(2) and (3), for the reference years 2020, 2023 and 2026, as listed in Annex III. The core data collection for the reference year 2020 shall be carried out as a census.\n2.   The core data collections for the reference years 2023 and 2026 may be carried out on samples. In that case, Member States shall ensure that the weighted results are statistically representative of agricultural holdings within each region and are designed to meet the precision requirements set out in Annex V.\n3.   When a variable listed in Annex III has a low or zero prevalence in a Member State, that variable may be excluded from the data collection subject to the Member State concerned providing information duly justifying its exclusion to the Commission (Eurostat) in the calendar year preceding the reference year.\n4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing acts specifying the descriptions of variables listed in Annex III.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 17(2) not later than 28 February 2019 for the reference year 2020, not later than 31 December 2021 for the reference year 2023, and not later than 31 December 2024 for the reference year 2026.\n5.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 concerning amendments of the variables listed in Annex III where necessary for the purpose of harmonisation with the data sources specified in Article 4(2), for the years 2023 and 2026. In exercising its power, the Commission shall ensure that such delegated acts only replace variables listed in Annex III that can no longer be derived from the specified data sources. In the event of replacement, the Commission shall ensure that the new variables can be derived from the data sources specified in Article 4(2). It shall further ensure that such delegated acts are duly justified and do not impose significant additional burdens or costs on the Member States or on the respondents.\n6.   Those delegated acts shall be adopted by 30 September 2021 for the reference year 2023 and by 30 September 2024 for the reference year 2026.\nArticle 6\nFrame extension\n1.   Member States that extend the frame in accordance with Article 3(4) shall provide core data on the agricultural holdings included in that frame extension for the reference year 2020, covering the information specified in Annex III.\n2.   The data collection on the agricultural holdings in the frame extension may be carried out on samples. In that case, Member States shall ensure that the weighted results are statistically representative of agricultural holdings within each region and are designed to meet the precision requirements set out in Annex V.\nArticle 7\nModule data\n1.   Member States shall collect and provide the modules on the topics and detailed topics listed in Annex IV for the following reference years:\n(a)\n‘Labour force and other gainful activities’ module for 2020, 2023 and 2026;\n(b)\n‘Rural development’ module for 2020, 2023 and 2026;\n(c)\n‘Animal housing and manure management’ module for 2020 and 2026;\n(d)\n‘Irrigation’ module for 2023;\n(e)\n‘Soil management practices’ module for 2023;\n(f)\n‘Machinery and equipment’ module for 2023;\n(g)\n‘Orchard’ module for 2023;\n(h)\n‘Vineyard’ module for 2026.\n2.   The scope of those data collections shall include the agricultural holdings referred to in Article 3(2) and (3).\n3.   The data collection of modules may be carried out on samples of agricultural holdings. In that case Member States shall ensure that the weighted results are statistically representative of agricultural holdings within each region and are designed to meet the precision requirements set out in Annex V.\n4.   The modules shall be collected from sub-samples of the agricultural holdings for which core data is collected. The modules shall reflect the situation in the reference year but may be based on the year directly preceding or following the reference year for the modules referred to in points (f), (g) and (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article. In any case, each record providing information on modules shall be accompanied by the core data listed in Annex III.\n5.   Member States with at least 1 000 hectares of any of the individual crops, referred to under the detailed topics of the ‘Orchard’ module in Annex IV, producing entirely or mainly for the market, shall carry out the ‘Orchard’ module for that particular crop.\n6.   Member States with at least 1 000 hectares of vineyards planted with vines with grapes for wine, producing entirely or mainly for the market shall carry out the ‘Vineyard’ module.\n7.   Member States with less than 2 % irrigable area of the UAA, and with no NUTS 2 level regions with at least 5 % of irrigable area of the UAA, shall be exempted from carrying out the ‘Irrigation’ module.\n8.   The Member States shall inform the Commission (Eurostat) of cases referred to in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 by the end of June of the year preceding the respective reference year.\n9.   When a variable has a low or zero prevalence in a Member State, that variable may be excluded from the data collection subject to providing information duly justifying the exclusion to the Commission (Eurostat) in the calendar year preceding the reference year.\nArticle 8\nTechnical specification concerning the module data\n1.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts specifying the following technical elements of the data to be provided for each module and the corresponding topic and detailed topic listed in Annex IV:\n(a)\nthe list of variables;\n(b)\nthe descriptions of variables.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 17(2) not later than 28 February 2019 for the reference year 2020, not later than 31 December 2021 for the reference year 2023 and not later than 31 December 2024 for the reference year 2026.\n2.   When adopting the implementing acts specifying the list of variables in accordance with paragraph 1, the Commission shall ensure that the overall number of core and module variables does not exceed 300 variables in 2020, 470 variables in 2023 and 350 variables in 2026.\n3.   For the years 2023 and 2026, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 concerning amendments of the detailed topics listed in Annex IV. In exercising its power, the Commission shall ensure that such delegated acts do not significantly increase the burden imposed by the number of variables. In particular, the Commission shall ensure that the delegated acts do not lead to an increase in the number of variables referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, and that a maximum of 20 % of the detailed topics listed in Annex IV are changed for each module by means of delegated acts. However, if 20 % represents less than one detailed topic then one detailed topic may nevertheless be changed.\n4.   Those delegated acts shall be adopted by 30 September 2021 for the reference year 2023 and by 30 September 2024 for the reference year 2026.\n5.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and the delegated acts referred to in paragraph 3 shall not impose significant additional costs which result in a disproportionate and unjustified burden on agricultural holdings and on Member States.\nArticle 9\nAd-hoc data\n1.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 supplementing the module data set out in Annex IV, if collection of additional information is deemed necessary. Those delegated acts shall specify:\n(a)\nthe topics and detailed topics to be provided in the ad-hoc module and the reasons for such additional statistical needs;\n(b)\nthe reference year.\n2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts referred to in paragraph 1 starting with the reference year 2023 and at three year intervals. It shall not propose ad-hoc modules for reference years during which data collection is carried out as a census.\n3.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts to provide:\n(a)\na list of variables not exceeding 20 variables to be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) and the corresponding measurement units;\n(b)\nthe descriptions of variables;\n(c)\nthe precision requirements;\n(d)\nthe reference periods;\n(e)\nthe transmission dates.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 17(2) not later than 12 months before the beginning of the reference year.\n4.   The delegated acts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the implementing acts referred to paragraph 3 of this Article shall not impose significant additional costs which result in a disproportionate and unjustified burden on agricultural holdings and on Member States.\nArticle 10\nReference period\nThe collected information shall refer to a single reference year that is common to all Member States by referring to the situation during a specified timeframe or date as follows:\n(a)\nFor land variables, the use of the land shall refer to the reference year. In the case of successive crops from the same piece of land, the land use shall refer to a crop that is harvested during the reference year, regardless of when the crop in question is sown.\n(b)\nFor variables on irrigation and soil management practices, the reference period is a 12-month period ending within the reference year, to be established by each Member State with a view to covering the related production cycles.\n(c)\nFor variables on livestock, animal housing and manure management a common reference day within the reference year shall be established by each Member State. The variables on manure management shall refer to a 12-month period including that date.\n(d)\nFor variables on labour force, a 12-month reference period ending on a reference day within the reference year shall be established by each Member State.\n(e)\nFor variables on rural development measures implemented in the individual agricultural holdings, the reference period shall be the three-year period ending on 31 December of the reference year.\n(f)\nFor all other variables, a common reference day within the reference year shall be established by each Member State.\nArticle 11\nQuality\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure the quality of the transmitted data and metadata.\n2.   For the purposes of this Regulation, the quality criteria defined in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 shall apply.\n3.   The Commission (Eurostat) shall assess the quality of the data and metadata transmitted.\n4.   For that purpose, Member States shall transmit a quality report describing the statistical process to the Commission (Eurostat), for each reference year covered by this Regulation, and in particular:\n(a)\nmetadata describing the methodology used and how technical specifications were achieved by reference to those laid down by this Regulation;\n(b)\ninformation on compliance with the minimum requirements for the sampling frames used, including in developing and updating them, as laid down in this Regulation;\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts setting out the practical arrangements for, and the contents of, the quality reports. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 17(2) and shall not impose significant additional burdens or costs on the Member States.\n5.   Member States shall inform the Commission (Eurostat) as soon as possible about any relevant information or change with regard to the implementation of this Regulation that could influence the quality of the data transmitted.\n6.   At the request of the Commission (Eurostat), Member States shall provide necessary additional clarification to evaluate the quality of the statistical information.\nArticle 12\nData and metadata transmission and deadlines\n1.   For the reference year 2020, Member States shall transmit validated core and module data and a quality report to the Commission (Eurostat) within 15 months after the end of the reference year.\n2.   For the reference years 2023 and 2026, Member States shall transmit validated core and module data and a quality report to the Commission (Eurostat) within 12 months after the end of the reference year.\n3.   The data transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) shall be at the level of individual agricultural holdings. The module and the ad-hoc data shall be linked to the core data listed in Annex III at the individual agricultural holding level for the same reference year. The records provided shall include the extrapolation factors and information on stratification.\n4.   Member States shall transmit the data and metadata using a technical format specified by the Commission (Eurostat). The data and metadata shall be provided to the Commission (Eurostat) through the single entry point services.\nArticle 13\nUnion contribution\n1.   For the implementation of this Regulation, the Union shall provide grants to the national statistical institutes and other national authorities referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, for:\n(a)\ndeveloping or implementing data requirements, or both;\n(b)\ndeveloping methodologies for modernising statistical systems aiming at higher quality or lower costs and reducing the administrative burden for producing integrated farm statistics by using the sources and methods referred to in Article 4.\n2.   Member States shall receive grants from the Union towards covering the cost of data collections specified in Articles 5, 6 and 7, within the scope of the financial envelope specified in Article 14.\n3.   The Union financial contribution referred to in paragraph 2 shall not exceed 75 % of the eligible costs, subject to the maximum amounts specified in paragraphs 4 and 5.\n4.   For the combined costs of the 2020 core data and module data collections, the Union financial contribution shall be limited to the maximum amounts specified below:\n(a)\nEUR 50 000 each for Luxembourg and Malta;\n(b)\nEUR 1 000 000 each for Austria, Croatia, Ireland and Lithuania;\n(c)\nEUR 2 000 000 each for Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Portugal and the United Kingdom;\n(d)\nEUR 3 000 000 each for Greece, Spain and France;\n(e)\nEUR 4 000 000 each for Italy, Poland and Romania;\n(f)\nEUR 300 000 each for all other Member States.\n5.

statistics\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1091 on integrated farm statistics\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt seeks to improve the production of EU agricultural statistics to ensure that they are consistent and comparable across the EU. This would allow decision-makers and other users to better plan for the future common agricultural policy, as well as to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of policies already in place.\nIt repeals: Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 on farm structure surveys from 1 January 2019;Regulation (EU) No 1337/2011 on production of EU statistics for permanent crops from 1 January 2022.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation:\nestablishes a simplified and modernised system for collecting European agricultural statistics at farm level. This allows for the integration of structural information with other information such as production methods, rural development measures and agro-environmental aspects;\nis designed to ensure the continuation of a series of European farm structure surveys, enabling a consistent time series to be maintained while fulfilling new and emerging needs for data at farm level;\nprovides a series of definitions including common land agricultural unit*, livestock unit*, utilised agricultural area* and kitchen gardens*.\nCoverage and data sources\nThe data required by the regulation must cover:\n98% of the total utilised agricultural area (excluding kitchen gardens); and\n98% of the livestock units of each EU country.\nSo long as they meet the quality requirements laid down in the regulation, EU countries can use one or more of the following sources or methods to produce statistics:\nstatistical surveys;\nadministrative sources such as data from: the integrated administration and control system (Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013);the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals (Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000);the system for the identification of sheep and goats (Regulation (EC) No 21/2004);the vineyard register (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013); andthe organic farm registers (Regulation (EC) No 834/2007);\nother sources, methods or innovative approaches (EU countries must give advance notice to Eurostat of their intention to use these and provide details of how they will be used).\nEU countries must collect and provide the core structural data* for the reference years 2020, 2023 and 2026, as listed in Annex III of the regulation. The core data collection for the reference year 2020 is to be carried out as a census.\nEU countries may, where this 2020 census overlaps with the 10-year population census, bring the farm data collection forward by a year to avoid the burden of conducting two major data collections at the same time.\nThe core data collections for the reference years 2023 and 2026 may be carried out using samples. Where this happens, EU countries must ensure that the weighted results are statistically representative of agricultural holdings within each region and are designed to meet the precision requirements set out in Annex V.\nEU budgetary contribution\nThe EU will contribute €40 million in grants to the national statistical institutes to help implement the programme of data collection for the reference year 2020. The amount for the period after 2020 will be fixed by the European Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission.\nDelegation of powers\nThe regulation grants the European Commission the power to adopt delegated acts to take into account emerging data needs arising from developments in agriculture, revised legislation and changing policy priorities. In this regard, it receives guidance from experts designated by each of the EU countries.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 27 August 2018.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nAn evaluation of the European agricultural statistics system concluded that although the main users of EU agricultural statistics were quite satisfied with the level of detail and quality of EU agricultural statistics, there was a lack of data on specific items, and the system was not harmonised enough and too rigid, not allowing the rapid introduction of new data collections. This new regulation addresses these concerns.\nFor more information, see:\nStrategy for agricultural statistics for 2020 and beyond (Eurostat).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCommon land agricultural unit: a piece of land to which common rights apply and which is used by two or more agricultural holdings for agricultural production, but is not allocated amongst them.\nLivestock unit: a standard measurement unit that allows for the aggregation of the various categories of livestock in order for them to be compared (for more details, see Annex I of the regulation).\nUtilised agricultural area: the land area used for farming, including arable land, permanent grassland, permanent crops, and other utilised agricultural land.\nKitchen garden: areas used for food production intended for one’s own consumption.\nCore structural data: the data to be collected, listed in Annex III.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2018/1091 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on integrated farm statistics and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1166/2008 and (EU) No 1337/2011 (OJ L 200, 7.8.2018, pp. 1-29)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, pp. 549-607)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 have been incorporated into the original document.
