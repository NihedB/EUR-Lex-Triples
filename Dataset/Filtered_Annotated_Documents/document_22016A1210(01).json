The purpose of this Agreement is to ensure a high level of protection of personal information and enhance cooperation between the United States and the European Union and its Member States, in relation to the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism.\n2.   For this purpose, this Agreement establishes the framework for the protection of personal information when transferred between the United States, on the one hand, and the European Union or its Member States, on the other.\n3.   This Agreement in and of itself shall not be the legal basis for any transfers of personal information. A legal basis for such transfers shall always be required.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor purposes of this Agreement:\n(1)\n‘Personal information’ means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to, in particular, an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;\n(2)\n‘Processing of personal information’ means any operation or set of operations involving collection, maintenance, use, alteration, organisation or structuring, disclosure or dissemination, or disposition;\n(3)\n‘Parties’ means the European Union and the United States of America;\n(4)\n‘Member State’ means a Member State of the European Union;\n(5)\n‘Competent Authority’ means, for the United States, a US national law enforcement authority responsible for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism and, for the European Union, an authority of the European Union, and an authority of a Member State, responsible for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism.\nArticle 3\nScope\n1.   This Agreement shall apply to personal information transferred between the Competent Authorities of one Party and the Competent Authorities of the other Party, or otherwise transferred in accordance with an agreement concluded between the United States and the European Union or its Member States, for the prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism.\n2.   This Agreement does not affect, and is without prejudice to, transfers or other forms of cooperation between the authorities of the Member States and of the United States other than those referred to in Article 2(5), responsible for safeguarding national security.\nArticle 4\nNon-Discrimination\nEach Party shall comply with its obligations under this Agreement for the purpose of protecting personal information of its own nationals and the other Party's nationals regardless of their nationality, and without arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination.\nArticle 5\nEffect of the Agreement\n1.   This Agreement supplements, as appropriate, but does not replace, provisions regarding the protection of personal information in international agreements between the Parties, or the United States and Member States that address matters within the scope of this Agreement.\n2.   The Parties shall take all necessary measures to implement this Agreement, including, in particular, their respective obligations regarding access, rectification and administrative and judicial redress for individuals provided herein. The protections and remedies set forth in this Agreement shall benefit individuals and entities in the manner implemented in the applicable domestic laws of each Party. For the United States, its obligations shall apply in a manner consistent with its fundamental principles of federalism.\n3.   By giving effect to paragraph 2, the processing of personal information by the United States, or the European Union and its Member States, with respect to matters falling within the scope of this Agreement, shall be deemed to comply with their respective data protection legislation restricting or conditioning international transfers of personal information, and no further authorisation under such legislation shall be required.\nArticle 6\nPurpose and Use Limitations\n1.   The transfer of personal information shall be for specific purposes authorised by the legal basis for the transfer as set forth in Article 1.\n2.   The further processing of personal information by a Party shall not be incompatible with the purposes for which it was transferred. Compatible processing includes processing pursuant to the terms of existing international agreements and written international frameworks for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious crimes. All such processing of personal information by other national law enforcement, regulatory or administrative authorities shall respect the other provisions of this Agreement.\n3.   This Article shall not prejudice the ability of the transferring Competent Authority to impose additional conditions in a specific case to the extent the applicable legal framework for transfer permits it to do so. Such conditions shall not include generic data protection conditions, that is, conditions imposed that are unrelated to the specific facts of the case. If the information is subject to conditions, the receiving Competent Authority shall comply with them. The Competent Authority providing the information may also require the recipient to give information on the use made of the transferred information.\n4.   Where the United States, on the one hand, and the European Union or a Member State on the other, conclude an agreement on the transfer of personal information other than in relation to specific cases, investigations or prosecutions, the specified purposes for which the information is transferred and processed shall be further set forth in that agreement.\n5.   The Parties shall ensure under their respective laws that personal information is processed in a manner that is directly relevant to and not excessive or overbroad in relation to the purposes of such processing.\nArticle 7\nOnward Transfer\n1.   Where a Competent Authority of one Party has transferred personal information relating to a specific case to a Competent Authority of the other Party, that information may be transferred to a State not bound by the present Agreement or international body only where the prior consent of the Competent Authority originally sending that information has been obtained.\n2.   When granting its consent to a transfer under paragraph 1, the Competent Authority originally transferring the information shall take due account of all relevant factors, including the seriousness of the offence, the purpose for which the data is initially transferred and whether the State not bound by the present Agreement or international body in question ensures an appropriate level of protection of personal information. It may also subject the transfer to specific conditions.\n3.   Where the United States, on the one hand, and the European Union or a Member State on the other, conclude an agreement on the transfer of personal information other than in relation to specific cases, investigations or prosecutions, the onward transfer of personal information may only take place in accordance with specific conditions set forth in the agreement that provide due justification for the onward transfer. The agreement shall also provide for appropriate information mechanisms between the Competent Authorities.\n4.   Nothing in this Article shall be construed as affecting any requirement, obligation or practice pursuant to which the prior consent of the Competent Authority originally transferring the information must be obtained before the information is further transferred to a State or body bound by this Agreement, provided that the level of data protection in such State or body shall not be the basis for denying consent for, or imposing conditions on, such transfers.\nArticle 8\nMaintaining Quality and Integrity of Information\nThe Parties shall take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness as is necessary and appropriate for lawful processing of the information. For this purpose, the Competent Authorities shall have in place procedures, the object of which is to ensure the quality and integrity of personal information, including the following:\n(a)\nthe measures referred to in Article 17;\n(b)\nwhere the transferring Competent Authority becomes aware of significant doubts as to the relevance, timeliness, completeness or accuracy of such personal information or an assessment it has transferred, it shall, where feasible, advise the receiving Competent Authority thereof;\n(c)\nwhere the receiving Competent Authority becomes aware of significant doubts as to the relevance, timeliness, completeness or accuracy of personal information received from a governmental authority, or of an assessment made by the transferring Competent Authority of the accuracy of information or the reliability of a source, it shall, where feasible, advise the transferring Competent Authority thereof.\nArticle 9\nInformation Security\nThe Parties shall ensure that they have in place appropriate technical, security and organisational arrangements for the protection of personal information against all of the following:\n(a)\naccidental or unlawful destruction;\n(b)\naccidental loss; and\n(c)\nunauthorised disclosure, alteration, access, or other processing.\nSuch arrangements shall include appropriate safeguards regarding the authorisation required to access personal information.\nArticle 10\nNotification of an Information Security Incident\n1.   Upon discovery of an incident involving accidental loss or destruction, or unauthorised access, disclosure, or alteration of personal information, in which there is a significant risk of damage, the receiving Competent Authority shall promptly assess the likelihood and scale of damage to individuals and to the integrity of the transferring Competent Authority's programme, and promptly take appropriate action to mitigate any such damage.\n2.   Action to mitigate damage shall include notification to the transferring Competent Authority. However, notification may:\n(a)\ninclude appropriate restrictions as to the further transmission of the notification;\n(b)\nbe delayed or omitted when such notification may endanger national security;\n(c)\nbe delayed when such notification may endanger public security operations.\n3.

The Competent Authorities involved in the transfer of the personal information may consult concerning the incident and the response thereto.\nArticle 11\nMaintaining Records\n1.   The Parties shall have in place effective methods of demonstrating the lawfulness of processing of personal information, which may include the use of logs, as well as other forms of records.\n2.   The Competent Authorities may use such logs or records for maintaining orderly operations of the databases or files concerned, to ensure data integrity and security, and where necessary to follow backup procedures.\nArticle 12\nRetention Period\n1.   The Parties shall provide in their applicable legal frameworks specific retention periods for records containing personal information, the object of which is to ensure that personal information is not retained for longer than is necessary and appropriate. Such retention periods shall take into account the purposes of processing, the nature of the data and the authority processing it, the impact on relevant rights and interests of affected persons, and other applicable legal considerations.\n2.   Where the United States, on the one hand, and the European Union or a Member State on the other, conclude an agreement on the transfer of personal information other than in relation to specific cases, investigations or prosecutions, such agreement will include a specific and mutually agreed upon provision on retention periods.\n3.   The Parties shall provide procedures for periodic review of the retention period with a view to determining whether changed circumstances require further modification of the applicable period.\n4.   The Parties shall publish or otherwise make publicly available such retention periods.\nArticle 13\nSpecial Categories of Personal Information\n1.   Processing of personal information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or religious or other beliefs, trade union membership or personal information concerning health or sexual life shall only take place under appropriate safeguards in accordance with law. Such appropriate safeguards may include: restricting the purposes for which the information may be processed, such as allowing the processing only on a case by case basis; masking, deleting or blocking the information after effecting the purpose for which it was processed; restricting personnel permitted to access the information; requiring specialised training to personnel who access the information; requiring supervisory approval to access the information; or other protective measures. These safeguards shall duly take into account the nature of the information, particular sensitivities of the information, and the purpose for which the information is processed.\n2.   Where the United States, on the one hand, and the European Union or a Member State on the other, conclude an agreement on the transfer of personal information other than in relation to specific cases, investigations or prosecutions, such agreement will further specify the standards and conditions under which such information can be processed, duly taking into account the nature of the information and the purpose for which it is used.\nArticle 14\nAccountability\n1.   The Parties shall have in place measures to promote accountability for processing personal information within the scope of this Agreement by their Competent Authorities, and any other of their authorities to which personal information has been transferred. Such measures shall include notification of the safeguards applicable to transfers of personal information under this Agreement, and of the conditions that may have been imposed by the transferring Competent Authority pursuant to Article 6(3). Serious misconduct shall be addressed through appropriate and dissuasive criminal, civil or administrative sanctions.\n2.   The measures set out in paragraph 1 shall include, as appropriate, discontinuation of transfer of personal information to authorities of constituent territorial entities of the Parties not covered by this Agreement that have not effectively protected personal information, taking into account the purpose of this Agreement, and in particular the purpose and use limitations and onward transfer provisions of this Agreement.\n3.   In case of allegations of improper implementation of this Article, a Party may request the other Party to provide relevant information, including, where appropriate, regarding the measures taken under this Article.\nArticle 15\nAutomated Decisions\nDecisions producing significant adverse actions concerning the relevant interests of the individual may not be based solely on the automated processing of personal information without human involvement, unless authorised under domestic law, and with appropriate safeguards that include the possibility to obtain human intervention.\nArticle 16\nAccess\n1.   The Parties shall ensure that any individual is entitled to seek access to his or her personal information and, subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraph 2, to obtain it.

The agreement will enter into force only after the parties have notified each other that their respective internal procedures for entry into force have been completed (which, on the EU side, requires that the Council adopts a decision to conclude the agreement following consent by the European Parliament).\nThe agreement aims to ensure that personal data is protected to a high standard when being transferred by law enforcement authorities (police and criminal justice authorities). It also aims to foster law enforcement cooperation between the EU and the EU countries, on the one hand, and the US on the other.\nIt provides greater legal certainty and strengthens the rights of the individuals concerned by the transfer of their data.\nThe agreement is 1 of 3 key actions set out in a 2016 Communication designed to restore trust in data flows between the EU and the US.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe agreement complements rules regarding personal data protection in existing EU/EU country-US agreements, and in national laws, that authorise the exchange of information for law enforcement purposes. It establishes a common data protection framework which will also apply to future agreements and national laws in this field.\nThe agreement covers all personal data (including names, addresses, criminal records) exchanged between the EU and the US for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism.\nProtection\nThe agreement provides a number of protections for personal data when they are exchanged between police and criminal justice authorities including:\nclear limitations on data use — personal data may only be used for the purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting criminal offences.\nrestrictions on onward transfer — any onward transfer to a non-US, non-EU country or international organisation must be approved by the competent authority of the country which had originally transferred personal data.\nretention periods — personal data may not be retained for longer than necessary or appropriate. These retention periods must be published or otherwise made publicly available.\nright to access personal data and to rectification — any individual is entitled to access their personal data, subject to certain conditions, and can request the data be corrected if inaccurate.\nnotification in the case of data security breaches — a mechanism will be put in place so as to ensure that the competent authority and, where appropriate, the data subject* is notified of any data security breach.\njudicial redress and enforceability of rights — EU citizens will be granted an additional right to seek judicial redress before US courts if US authorities deny access or rectification, or unlawfully disclose their personal data. In addition, any EU data subject can rely on the already existing judicial redress rights in the US.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE AGREEMENT APPLY?\n              \nThe decision has applied since 20 May 2016.
