{"celex_id": "32001R1936", "reference": "3.10.2001\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 263/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1936/2001\nof 27 September 2001\nlaying down control measures applicable to fishing for certain stocks of highly migratory fish\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Community has since 14 November 1997 been a Contracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (3) (hereinafter referred to as the ICCAT Convention).\n(2)\nThe ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation on the conservation and management of resources of tuna and tuna-like fish in the Atlantic ocean and adjacent seas through an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereinafter referred to as ICCAT), and the adoption of recommendations on conservation and management in the Convention area that become obligatory for Contracting Parties.\n(3)\nICCAT has adopted a number of recommendations creating control and surveillance obligations, notably on the establishment and transmission of statistics, inspection in port, vessel surveillance by satellite, vessel observations and transhipments, and checks on non-contracting parties and on stateless vessels. These recommendations have become obligatory for the Community and should therefore be implemented.\n(4)\nCertain obligations have been transposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1351/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down certain control measures to ensure compliance with the measures adopted by ICCAT (4) and into Article 22(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2742/1999 of 17 December 1999 fixing for 2000 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where limitations in catch are required and amending Regulation (EC) No 66/98 (5). For reasons of clarity these measures should be incorporated in a single Regulation, repealing and replacing former Regulations.\n(5)\nFor scientific research purposes masters of Community fishing vessels should be required to comply with the instructions of the ‘Operational manual for statistics and sampling of tuna and tuna-like fish in the Atlantic Ocean’ published by ICCAT.\n(6)\nThe Community has approved the Agreement for the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (6), (hereinafter referred to as IOTC). The Agreement provides a useful framework for strengthening international cooperation for the purpose of conserving and rationally utilising Indian Ocean tuna and related species, through creation of the IOTC and the adoption of recommendations on conservation and management in its area of competence that become binding on Contracting Parties. The Community should apply the control measures adopted by the IOTC.\n(7)\nThe IOTC has adopted a recommendation on the recording and exchange of information on tropical tuna. This is binding on the Community, which should therefore implement it.\n(8)\nThe Community has fishing interests in the Eastern Pacific and has initiated the procedure for accession to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, (hereinafter referred to as IATTC). Pending accession and in line with its cooperation requirement arising under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it should apply the control measures adopted by the IATTC.\n(9)\nThe Community, which has signed the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (7), has decided by Decision 1999/386/EC (8) to apply it provisionally pending its approval, and should therefore apply its control measures.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure the respect of the applicable control measures of the IOTC, IATTC and of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme, Member States should take the necessary action.\n(11)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (9) applies to all fishing activities and all associated activities carried out on the territory and in the maritime waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States, including those of Community fishing vessels operating in the waters of third countries or on the high seas, without prejudice to fishery agreements concluded between the Community and third countries or international conventions to which the Community is a Party.\n(12)\nThe measures necessary for implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (10),\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nPurpose\nThis Regulation lays down control and inspection measures relating to fishing for stocks of the highly migratory fish species listed in Annex I to this Regulation and shall apply to vessels flying the flag of Member States and registered in the Community, (hereinafter referred to as Community fishing vessels), operating in one of the zones specified in Article 2.\nArticle 2\nZones\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following marine zones are specified:\n(a)\nZone 1:\nAll waters of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas included in the ICCAT Convention area specified in Article I of that Convention.\n(b)\nZone 2:\nAll Indian Ocean waters included in the area of competence specified in Article II of the Agreement for the establishment of the IOTC.\n(c)\nZone 3:\nAll Eastern Pacific Ocean waters included in the area specified in Article III of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘boarding’: the boarding of a fishing vessel within an organisation's area of competence by one or more authorised inspectors in order to make an inspection;\n(b)\n‘transhipment’: unloading of any quantity of highly migratory fish and/or products from such fish from on board a fishing vessel to another vessel either at sea or in port, without the products having been recorded by a port State as landed;\n(c)\n‘landing’: unloading of any quantity of highly migratory fish and/or products from such fish from on board a fishing vessel to port or to land;\n(d)\n‘infringement’: any presumed act committed or omitted by a fishing vessel that is recorded in an inspection report and gives serious reason for suspecting a breach of the provisions of this Regulation or any other Regulation transposing a recommendation adopted by a regional organisation for one of the zones indicated in Article 2;\n(e)\n‘vessel of a non-Contracting Party’: vessel observed and identified as engaged in fishing activities in one of the zones specified in Article 2 that is flying the flag of a country that is not a Contracting Party to the relevant regional organisation;\n(f)\n‘stateless vessel’: vessel for which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting it to be without nationality.\nCHAPTER I\nCONTROL AND INSPECTION MEASURES APPLICABLE IN ZONE 1\nSection 1\nControl measures\nArticle 4\nCatch sampling\n1.

The main species concerned are:\ntuna;\nswordfish;\nsharks;\nwhales; and\nporpoises.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation applies to fishing vessels flying the flag of EU countries and registered in the EU, operating in one of the following marine zones:\nZone 1: all waters of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas included in the area covered by the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT Convention)*. This Convention enabled the creation of a fisheries organisation which the EU joined in 1997: the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT);\nZone 2: all Indian Ocean waters covered by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)*;\nZone 3: all eastern Pacific Ocean waters including the zone defined in the agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme.\nCONTROL AND INSPECTION MEASURES APPLICABLE IN ZONE 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1936/2001 has been amended several times, most recently by Regulation (EU) 2017/2107. The 2017 regulation repealed parts of Regulation (EC) No 1936/2001 to take account of various changes adopted in ICCAT recommendations since 2008.\nFattening of bluefin tuna\nA register of bluefin tuna fattening* farms was introduced in 2004. An EU country has to notify the European Commission of the fattening farms under its jurisdiction which it authorises to carry out fattening of bluefin tuna caught in the ICCAT Convention area. Unregistered fattening farms may not carry out fattening of bluefin tuna caught in the Convention area.\nWhere bluefin tuna are transferred for fattening from an EU fishing vessel to a transport vessel, the masters of the two vessels are required to enter certain data in their respective logbooks (the quantities of bluefin tuna transferred, the catch zone, the date and position where the transfer took place, etc.).\nEU countries must:\nregister the quantities of bluefin tuna put into cages by vessels flying their flag;\nnotify the Commission of data relating to the quantities of bluefin tuna caught and caged by vessels flying their flag, and exports and imports of bluefin tuna caught and intended for fattening;\nensure that bluefin tuna fattening farms under their jurisdiction submit a caging declaration to their competent authority and are listed on the register;\nensure that fattening farms submit to them each year a marketing declaration for the bluefin tuna fattened and, on the basis of this information, then inform the Commission of the quantities of bluefin tuna caged and the quantities marketed during the previous year.\nCONTROL AND INSPECTION MEASURES APPLICABLE IN ZONE 2\nEach EU country must: ensure that vessels flying its flag respect the measures applicable in the zone;send to the Commission the list of vessels of more than 24 metres overall length flying its flag and registered in its territory that it authorises to fish for tuna and tuna-like fish in the IOTC area. The Commission sends this information to the IOTC Executive Secretariat;ensure that only registered vessels carry out fishing activities.\nVessels registered on the IOTC list which fish by longlining* must obtain authorisation from the competent authorities of the flag EU country before carrying out transshipment* procedures in the IOTC fishing area.\nThe fishing gear of EU vessels authorised to fish in the IOTC zone must bear special markings.\nEU countries must: transmit to the IOTC secretariat various statistical data on fishing effort and catches concerning migratory species;set up a computerised database containing the required statistical data, with access for the Commission;assign inspectors to inspection duties at their ports who will be responsible for the surveillance and inspection of transhipment and landing of the species listed in Annex I;issue a special identification document to each inspector.\nThe master of the vessel must cooperate with the vessel inspection and provide the means for examining the zones, equipment and documents.\nIf there is a serious reason to believe that a fishing vessel has breached the IOTC’s conservation measures, the inspector notes the infringement in the inspection report. He must ensure the safekeeping of the evidence and send the inspection report to his authority. The EU country which has been notified of an infringement by a vessel flying its flag must take speedy action to obtain and examine the evidence, carry out any necessary investigation and inspect the vessel. It then notifies the Commission of the penalties imposed and measures taken with regard to the vessel concerned. The Commission, in turn, informs the IOTC Executive Secretariat.\nEU fishing vessels are prohibited from receiving transhipments of fish of the species listed in Annex I from stateless vessels* or those flying the flag of a country that is not a cooperating party. EU countries send any inspection findings of stateless vessels and any action they have taken under international law to the Commission.\nCONTROL AND INSPECTION MEASURES SPECIFIC TO ZONE 3\nEach EU country must ensure that vessels flying its flag respect the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission measures incorporated into EU law and the relevant International Dolphin Conservation Programme agreement measures.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 23 October 2001.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe EU participates in regional fisheries organisations (RFMOs) which allow cooperation on the conservation and management of stocks of highly migratory fish. As a contracting party, it is required to apply the control and monitoring measures resulting from recommendations adopted by these RFMOs.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nInternational Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT Convention): this convention set up the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
