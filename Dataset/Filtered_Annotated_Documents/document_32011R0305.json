{"celex_id": "32011R0305", "reference": "4.4.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 88/5\nREGULATION (EU) No 305/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 9 March 2011\nlaying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe rules of Member States require that construction works be designed and executed so as not to endanger the safety of persons, domestic animals or property nor damage the environment.\n(2)\nThose rules have a direct influence on the requirements of construction products. Those requirements are consequently reflected in national product standards, national technical approvals and other national technical specifications and provisions related to construction products. Due to their disparity, those requirements hinder trade within the Union.\n(3)\nThis Regulation should not affect the right of Member States to specify the requirements they deem necessary to ensure the protection of health, the environment and workers when using construction products.\n(4)\nMember States have introduced provisions, including requirements, relating not only to safety of buildings and other construction works but also to health, durability, energy economy, protection of the environment, economic aspects, and other important aspects in the public interest. Laws, regulations, administrative measures or case-law, established either at Union or Member State level, concerning construction works may have an impact on the requirements of construction products. Since their effect on the functioning of the internal market is likely to be very similar, it is appropriate to consider such laws, regulations, administrative measures or case-law as ‘provisions’ for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(5)\nWhere applicable, provisions for an intended use or uses of a construction product in a Member State, aimed at fulfilling basic requirements for construction works, determine the essential characteristics the performance of which should be declared. In order to avoid an empty declaration of performance, at least one of the essential characteristics of a construction product which are relevant for the declared use or uses should be declared.\n(6)\nCouncil Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products (3) aimed to remove technical barriers to trade in the field of construction products in order to enhance their free movement in the internal market.\n(7)\nIn order to achieve that objective, Directive 89/106/EEC provided for the establishment of harmonised standards for construction products and provided for the granting of European technical approvals.\n(8)\nDirective 89/106/EEC should be replaced in order to simplify and clarify the existing framework, and improve the transparency and the effectiveness of the existing measures.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should take account of the horizontal legal framework for the marketing of products in the internal market, established by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (4) as well as by Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products (5).\n(10)\nThe removal of technical barriers in the field of construction may only be achieved by the establishment of harmonised technical specifications for the purposes of assessing the performance of construction products.\n(11)\nThose harmonised technical specifications should include testing, calculation and other means, defined within harmonised standards and European Assessment Documents for assessing performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products.\n(12)\nThe methods used by the Member States in their requirements for construction works, as well as other national rules relating to the essential characteristics of construction products, should be in accordance with harmonised technical specifications.\n(13)\nWhere appropriate, classes of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products should be encouraged to be used in harmonised standards, so as to take account of different levels of basic requirements for construction works for certain construction works as well as of the differences in climate, geology and geography and other different conditions prevailing in the Member States. On the basis of a revised mandate, the European standardisation bodies should be entitled to establish such classes in cases where the Commission has not already established them.\n(14)\nWhere an intended use requires threshold levels in relation to any essential characteristic to be fulfilled by construction products in Member States, those levels should be established in the harmonised technical specifications.\n(15)\nWhen assessing the performance of a construction product, account should also be taken of the health and safety aspects related to its use during its entire life cycle.\n(16)\nThreshold levels determined by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation should be generally recognised values for the essential characteristics of the construction product in question with regard to the provisions in Member States and should ensure a high level of protection within the meaning of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(17)\nThreshold levels can be of a technical or regulatory nature, and may be applicable to a single characteristic or to a set of characteristics.\n(18)\nThe European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) are recognised as the competent organisations for the adoption of harmonised standards in accordance with the general guidelines for cooperation between the Commission and those two organisations signed on 28 March 2003. Manufacturers should use those harmonised standards when the references to them have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in accordance with the criteria established under Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (6). Once a sufficient level of technical and scientific expertise on all the relevant aspects is attained, recourse to harmonised standards with regard to construction products should be increased, including, where appropriate, and after consultation of the Standing Committee on Construction, by requiring, by means of mandates, that those standards be developed on the basis of existing European Assessment Documents.\n(19)\nThe procedures under Directive 89/106/EEC for assessing performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products not covered by a harmonised standard should be simplified in order to make them more transparent and to reduce costs to manufacturers of construction products.\n(20)\nIn order to allow a manufacturer of a construction product to draw up a declaration of performance for a construction product which is not covered or not fully covered by a harmonised standard, it is necessary to provide for a European Technical Assessment.\n(21)\nManufacturers of construction products should be allowed to request European Technical Assessments to be issued for their products on the basis of the guidelines for European technical approval established under Directive 89/106/EEC. The right to use those guidelines as European Assessment Documents should therefore be ensured.\n(22)\nThe establishment of draft European Assessment Documents and the issuing of European Technical Assessments should be entrusted to Technical Assessment Bodies (hereinafter referred to as ‘TABs’) designated by Member States. In order to ensure that TABs have the necessary competence for carrying out those tasks, the requirements for their designation should be set out at Union level.\n(23)\nTABs should establish an organisation (hereinafter referred to as an ‘organisation of TABs’), supported, where applicable, through Union financing, to coordinate procedures for the establishment of draft European Assessment Documents and for the issuing of the European Technical Assessments, ensuring the transparency and the necessary confidentiality of those procedures.\n(24)\nExcept in the cases laid down in this Regulation, the placing on the market of a construction product which is covered by a harmonised standard or for which a European Technical Assessment has been issued should be accompanied by a declaration of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of the construction product in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specifications.\n(25)\nWhere applicable, the declaration of performance should be accompanied by information on the content of hazardous substances in the construction product in order to improve the possibilities for sustainable construction and to facilitate the development of environment-friendly products. Such information should be provided without prejudice to the obligations, particularly with regard to labelling, laid down in other instruments of Union law applicable to hazardous substances and should be made available at the same time and in the same form as the declaration of performance so as to reach all potential users of construction products. Information on the content of hazardous substances should initially be limited to substances referred to in Articles 31 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency (7). However, the specific need for information on the content of hazardous substances in construction products should be further investigated with a view to completing the range of substances covered so as to ensure a high level of protection of the health and safety of workers using construction products and of users of construction works, including with regard to recycling and/or reuse requirements of parts or materials. This Regulation is without prejudice to Member States’ rights and obligations pursuant to other instruments of Union law that may apply to hazardous substances, in particular, Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (8), Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9), Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste (10) and Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (11).\n(26)\nIt should be possible for the declaration of performance to be numbered in accordance with the product-type reference number.\n(27)\nIt is necessary to provide for simplified procedures for the drawing up of declarations of performance in order to alleviate the financial burden of enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n(28)\nIn order to ensure that the declaration of performance is accurate and reliable, the performance of the construction product should be assessed and the production in the factory should be controlled in accordance with an appropriate system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance of the construction product. Several systems could be chosen to be applied for a given construction product, in order to take into account the specific relationship of some of its essential characteristics to the basic requirements for construction works.\n(29)\nGiven the specificity of construction products and the particular focus of the system for their assessment, the procedures for the conformity assessment provided for in Decision No 768/2008/EC, and the modules set out therein, are not appropriate. Specific methods should therefore be established for the assessment and verification of constancy of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products.\n(30)\nDue to the difference in the meaning of the CE marking for construction products, when compared to the general principles set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, specific provisions should be put in place to ensure the clarity of the obligation to affix the CE marking to construction products and the consequences thereof.\n(31)\nBy affixing the CE marking or having such marking affixed to a construction product, manufacturers should indicate that they take responsibility for the conformity of that product with its declared performance.\n(32)\nThe CE marking should be affixed to all construction products for which the manufacturer has drawn up a declaration of performance in accordance with this Regulation. If a declaration of performance has not been drawn up, the CE marking should not be affixed.\n(33)\nThe CE marking should be the only marking of conformity of the construction product with the declared performance and compliance with applicable requirements relating to Union harmonisation legislation. However, other markings may be used, provided that they help to improve the protection of users of construction products and are not covered by existing Union harmonisation legislation.\n(34)\nTo avoid the unnecessary testing of construction products for which performance has already been sufficiently demonstrated by stable test results or other existing data, the manufacturer should be allowed, under conditions set up in the harmonised technical specifications or in a Commission decision, to declare a certain level or class of performance without testing or without further testing.\n(35)\nTo avoid duplicating tests already carried out, a manufacturer of a construction product should be allowed to use the test results obtained by a third party.\n(36)\nConditions should be defined for the use of simplified procedures for the assessment of the performance of construction products, in order to reduce as far as possible the cost of placing them on the market, without reducing the level of safety. The manufacturers using such simplified procedures should demonstrate appropriately the fulfilment of those conditions.\n(37)\nIn order to enhance the impact of market surveillance measures, all simplified procedures provided for in this Regulation for the assessment of the performance of construction products should apply only to natural or legal persons which manufacture the products they place on the market.\n(38)\nTo further decrease the cost to micro-enterprises of placing construction products, which they have manufactured, on the market, it is necessary to provide for simplified procedures for the assessment of performance when the products in question do not imply significant safety concerns while complying with the applicable requirements, whatever the origin of those requirements. Enterprises applying those simplified procedures should, in addition, demonstrate that they qualify as micro-enterprises. Moreover, they should follow the applicable procedures for verification of constancy of performance provided for in the harmonised technical specifications for their products.\n(39)\nFor an individually designed and manufactured construction product, the manufacturer should be allowed to use simplified procedures for the assessment of performance, where it can be demonstrated that the product placed on the market complies with the applicable requirements.\n(40)\nThe interpretative framework for the definition of ‘non-series process’, to be applied to different construction products covered by this Regulation, should be established by the Commission in consultation with the Standing Committee on Construction.\n(41)\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they place or make available on the market only construction products which are in compliance with the requirements of this Regulation, which aim to ensure the performance of construction products and fulfil basic requirements for construction works. In particular, importers and distributors of construction products should be aware of the essential characteristics for which there are provisions on the Union market, and of the specific requirements in Member States in relation to the basic requirements for construction works, and should use this knowledge in their commercial transactions.\n(42)\nIt is important to ensure the accessibility of national technical rules so that enterprises, and in particular SMEs, can gather reliable and precise information about the law in force in the Member State where they intend to place or make available on the market their products. Member States should therefore designate Product Contact Points for Construction for this purpose. In addition to the tasks defined in Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 764/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State (12), Product Contact Points for Construction should also provide information on rules applicable to the incorporation, assembling or installation of a specific type of construction product.\n(43)\nIn order to facilitate the free movement of goods, Product Contact Points for Construction should provide, free of charge, information about provisions aimed at fulfilling basic requirements for construction works applicable to the intended use of each construction product in the territory of each Member State. Product Contact Points for Construction may also provide economic operators with additional information or observations. For additional information, Product Contact Points for Construction should be allowed to charge fees that are proportionate to the costs of providing such information or observations. Member States should furthermore ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to the Product Contact Points for Construction.\n(44)\nSince the creation of Product Contact Points for Construction should not interfere with the allocation of functions among competent authorities within the regulatory systems of the Member States, it should be possible for Member States to set up Product Contact Points for Construction in accordance with regional or local competences. Member States should be able to entrust the role of Product Contact Points for Construction to existing contact points established in accordance with other Union instruments, in order to prevent the unnecessary proliferation of contact points and to simplify administrative procedures. In order not to increase administrative costs for enterprises and competent authorities, Member States should also be able to entrust the role of Product Contact Points for Construction not only to existing services within the public administration, but also to national SOLVIT centres, chambers of commerce, professional organisations and private bodies.\n(45)\nThe Product Contact Points for Construction should be able to carry out their functions in a manner that avoids conflicts of interest, particularly in respect of the procedures for obtaining the CE marking.\n(46)\nFor the purposes of ensuring an equivalent and consistent enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation, effective market surveillance should be operated by the Member States. Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 provides the basic conditions for the functioning of such market surveillance, notably for programmes, financing and penalties.\n(47)\nThe responsibility of Member States for safety, health and other matters covered by the basic requirements for construction works on their territory should be recognised in a safeguard clause providing for appropriate protective measures.\n(48)\nSince it is necessary to ensure throughout the Union a uniform level of performance of bodies carrying out the assessment and verification of constancy of performance of construction products, and since all such bodies should perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition, requirements should be set for those bodies seeking to be notified for the purposes of this Regulation. Provision should also be made for the availability of adequate information about such bodies and for their monitoring.\n(49)\nIn order to ensure a coherent level of quality in the assessment and verification of constancy of performance of construction products, it is also necessary to establish requirements applicable to the authorities responsible for notifying the bodies carrying out those tasks to the Commission and the other Member States.\n(50)\nIn accordance with Article 291 TFEU, rules and general principles for the control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers are to be laid down in advance by a regulation adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. Pending the adoption of that new regulation, Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (13) continues to apply, with the exception of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, which is no longer applicable.\n(51)\nFor the purposes of achieving the objectives of this Regulation, the Commission should be empowered to adopt certain delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(52)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts outlining the conditions for the use of websites to make available the declaration of performance.\n(53)\nSince a period of time is required to ensure that the framework for the proper functioning of this Regulation is in place, its application should be deferred with the exception of the provisions concerning the designation of TABs, notifying authorities and notified bodies, the establishment of an organisation of TABs and the establishment of the Standing Committee on Construction.\n(54)\nThe Commission and the Member States should, in collaboration with stakeholders, launch information campaigns to inform the construction sector, particularly economic operators and users of construction products, of the establishment of a common technical language, the distribution of responsibilities between individual economic operators and users, the affixing of the CE marking on construction products, the revision of the basic requirements for construction works and the systems of assessment and verification of constancy of performance.\n(55)\nThe basic requirement for construction works on sustainable use of natural resources should notably take into account the recyclability of construction works, their materials and parts after demolition, the durability of construction works and the use of environmentally compatible raw and secondary materials in construction works.\n(56)\nFor the assessment of the sustainable use of resources and of the impact of construction works on the environment Environmental Product Declarations should be used when available.\n(57)\nWherever possible, uniform European methods should be laid down for establishing compliance with the basic requirements set out in Annex I.\n(58)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to achieve the proper functioning of the internal market for construction products by means of harmonised technical specifications to express the performance of construction products, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down conditions for the placing or making available on the market of construction products by establishing

The basic requirements for construction works set out in Annex I shall constitute the basis for the preparation of standardisation mandates and harmonised technical specifications.\n2.   The essential characteristics of construction products shall be laid down in harmonised technical specifications in relation to the basic requirements for construction works.\n3.   For specific families of construction products covered by a harmonised standard, the Commission shall, where appropriate and in relation to their intended uses as defined in harmonised standards, determine by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 60, those essential characteristics for which the manufacturer shall declare the performance of the product when it is placed on the market.\nWhere appropriate, the Commission shall also determine, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 60, the threshold levels for the performance in relation to the essential characteristics to be declared.\nCHAPTER II\nDECLARATION OF PERFORMANCE AND CE MARKING\nArticle 4\nDeclaration of performance\n1.   When a construction product is covered by a harmonised standard or conforms to a European Technical Assessment which has been issued for it, the manufacturer shall draw up a declaration of performance when such a product is placed on the market.\n2.   When a construction product is covered by a harmonised standard or conforms to a European Technical Assessment which has been issued for it, information in any form about its performance in relation to the essential characteristics, as defined in the applicable harmonised technical specification, may be provided only if included and specified in the declaration of performance except where, in accordance with Article 5, no declaration of performance has been drawn up.\n3.   By drawing up the declaration of performance, the manufacturer shall assume responsibility for the conformity of the construction product with such declared performance. In the absence of objective indications to the contrary, Member States shall presume the declaration of performance drawn up by the manufacturer to be accurate and reliable.\nArticle 5\nDerogations from drawing up a declaration of performance\nBy way of derogation from Article 4(1) and in the absence of Union or national provisions requiring the declaration of essential characteristics where the construction products are intended to be used, a manufacturer may refrain from drawing up a declaration of performance when placing a construction product covered by a harmonised standard on the market where:\n(a)\nthe construction product is individually manufactured or custom-made in a non-series process in response to a specific order, and installed in a single identified construction work, by a manufacturer who is responsible for the safe incorporation of the product into the construction works, in compliance with the applicable national rules and under the responsibility of those responsible for the safe execution of the construction works designated under the applicable national rules;\n(b)\nthe construction product is manufactured on the construction site for its incorporation in the respective construction works in compliance with the applicable national rules and under the responsibility of those responsible for the safe execution of the construction works designated under the applicable national rules; or\n(c)\nthe construction product is manufactured in a traditional manner or in a manner appropriate to heritage conservation and in a non-industrial process for adequately renovating construction works officially protected as part of a designated environment or because of their special architectural or historic merit, in compliance with the applicable national rules.\nArticle 6\nContent of the declaration of performance\n1.   The declaration of performance shall express the performance of construction products in relation to the essential characteristics of those products in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specifications.\n2.   The declaration of performance shall contain, in particular, the following information:\n(a)\nthe reference of the product-type for which the declaration of performance has been drawn up;\n(b)\nthe system or systems of assessment and verification of constancy of performance of the construction product, as set out in Annex V;\n(c)\nthe reference number and date of issue of the harmonised standard or the European Technical Assessment which has been used for the assessment of each essential characteristic;\n(d)\nwhere applicable, the reference number of the Specific Technical Documentation used and the requirements with which the manufacturer claims the product complies.\n3.   The declaration of performance shall in addition contain:\n(a)\nthe intended use or uses for the construction product, in accordance with the applicable harmonised technical specification;\n(b)\nthe list of essential characteristics, as determined in the harmonised technical specification for the declared intended use or uses;\n(c)\nthe performance of at least one of the essential characteristics of the construction product, relevant for the declared intended use or uses;\n(d)\nwhere applicable, the performance of the construction product, by levels or classes, or in a description, if necessary based on a calculation in relation to its essential characteristics determined in accordance with Article 3(3);\n(e)\nthe performance of those essential characteristics of the construction product which are related to the intended use or uses, taking into consideration the provisions in relation to the intended use or uses where the manufacturer intends the product to be made available on the market;\n(f)\nfor the listed essential characteristics for which no performance is declared, the letters ‘NPD’ (No Performance Determined);\n(g)\nwhen a European Technical Assessment has been issued for that product, the performance, by levels or classes, or in a description, of the construction product in relation to all essential characteristics contained in the corresponding European Technical Assessment.\n4.   The declaration of performance shall be drawn up using the model set out in Annex III.\n5.   The information referred to in Article 31 or, as the case may be, in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, shall be provided together with the declaration of performance.\nArticle 7\nSupply of the declaration of performance\n1.   A copy of the declaration of performance of each product which is made available on the market shall be supplied either in paper form or by electronic means.\nHowever, where a batch of the same product is supplied to a single user, it may be accompanied by a single copy of the declaration of performance either in paper form or by electronic means.\n2.   A paper copy of the declaration of performance shall be supplied if the recipient requests it.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, the copy of the declaration of performance may be made available on a web site in accordance with conditions to be established by the Commission by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 60. Such conditions shall, inter alia, guarantee that the declaration of performance remains available at least for the period referred to in Article 11(2).\n4.   The declaration of performance shall be supplied in the language or the languages required by the Member State where the product is made available.\nArticle 8\nGeneral principles and use of CE marking\n1.   The general principles set out in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the CE marking.\n2.   The CE marking shall be affixed to those construction products for which the manufacturer has drawn up a declaration of performance in accordance with Articles 4 and 6.\nIf a declaration of performance has not been drawn up by the manufacturer in accordance with Articles 4 and 6, the CE marking shall not be affixed.\nBy affixing or having affixed the CE marking, manufacturers indicate that they take responsibility for the conformity of the construction product with the declared performance as well as the compliance with all applicable requirements laid down in this Regulation and in other relevant Union harmonisation legislation providing for its affixing.\nThe rules for affixing the CE marking provided for in other relevant Union harmonisation legislation shall apply without prejudice to this paragraph.\n3.   For any construction product covered by a harmonised standard, or for which a European Technical Assessment has been issued, the CE marking shall be the only marking which attests conformity of the construction product with the declared performance in relation to the essential characteristics, covered by that harmonised standard or by the European Technical Assessment.\nIn this respect, Member States shall not introduce any references or shall withdraw any references in national measures to a marking attesting conformity with the declared performance in relation to the essential characteristics covered by a harmonised standard other than the CE marking.\n4.   A Member State shall not prohibit or impede, within its territory or under its responsibility, the making available on the market or the use of construction products bearing the CE marking, when the declared performances correspond to the requirements for such use in that Member State.\n5.   A Member State shall ensure that the use of construction products bearing the CE marking shall not be impeded by rules or conditions imposed by public bodies or private bodies acting as a public undertaking, or acting as a public body on the basis of a monopoly position or under a public mandate, when the declared performances correspond to the requirements for such use in that Member State.\n6.   The methods used by the Member States in their requirements for construction works, as well as other national rules in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products, shall be in accordance with harmonised standards.\nArticle 9\nRules and conditions for the affixing of CE marking\n1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the construction product or to a label attached to it. Where this is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the product, it shall be affixed to the packaging or to the accompanying documents.\n2.   The CE marking shall be followed by the two last digits of the year in which it was first affixed, the name and the registered address of the manufacturer, or the identifying mark allowing identification of the name and address of the manufacturer easily and without any ambiguity, the unique identification code of the product-type, the reference number of the declaration of performance, the level or class of the performance declared, the reference to the harmonised technical specification applied, the identification number of the notified body, if applicable, and the intended use as laid down in the harmonised technical specification applied.\n3.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the construction product is placed on the market.

In the cases referred to in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 1, the TAB shall inform the organisation of TABs and the Commission of the content of the request and of the reference to a relevant Commission decision for assessment and verification of constancy of performance, which the TAB intends to apply for that product, or of the lack of such a Commission decision.\n3.   If the Commission considers that an appropriate decision for assessment and verification of constancy of performance does not exist for the construction product, Article 28 shall apply.\nArticle 22\nPublication\nEuropean Assessment Documents adopted by the organisation of TABs shall be sent to the Commission, which shall publish a list of references of the final European Assessment Documents in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThe Commission shall publish any updates to that list.\nArticle 23\nDispute resolution in cases of disagreement between TABs\nIf the TABs do not agree upon the European Assessment Document within the time limits provided for, the organisation of TABs shall submit this matter to the Commission for appropriate resolution.\nArticle 24\nContent of the European Assessment Document\n1.   A European Assessment Document shall contain, at least, a general description of the construction product, the list of essential characteristics, relevant for the intended use of the product as foreseen by the manufacturer and agreed between the manufacturer and the organisation of TABs, as well as the methods and criteria for assessing the performance of the product in relation to those essential characteristics.\n2.   Principles for the applicable factory production control to be applied shall be set out in the European Assessment Document, taking into account the conditions of the manufacturing process of the construction product concerned.\n3.   Where the performance of some of the essential characteristics of the product can appropriately be assessed with methods and criteria already established in other harmonised technical specifications or the Guidelines referred to in Article 66(3), or used in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 89/106/EEC before 1 July 2013 in the context of issuing European technical approvals, those existing methods and criteria shall be incorporated as parts of the European Assessment Document.\nArticle 25\nFormal objections against European Assessment Documents\n1.   Where a Member State or the Commission considers that a European Assessment Document does not entirely satisfy the demands to be met in relation to the basic requirements for construction works set out in Annex I, the Member State concerned or the Commission shall bring the matter before the Standing Committee on Construction, giving its arguments. The Standing Committee on Construction shall, after having consulted the organisation of TABs, deliver its opinion without delay.\n2.   In the light of the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction, the Commission shall decide to publish, not to publish, to publish with restriction, to maintain, to maintain with restriction or to withdraw the references to the European Assessment Documents concerned in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n3.   The Commission shall inform the organisation of TABs accordingly and, if necessary, request the revision of the European Assessment Document concerned.\nArticle 26\nEuropean Technical Assessment\n1.   The European Technical Assessment shall be issued by a TAB, at the request of a manufacturer on the basis of a European Assessment Document established in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 21 and Annex II.\nProvided that there is a European Assessment Document, a European Technical Assessment may be issued even in the case where a mandate for a harmonised standard has been issued. Such issuing shall be possible until the beginning of the coexistence period as determined by the Commission in accordance with Article 17(5).\n2.   The European Technical Assessment shall include the performance to be declared, by levels or classes, or in a description, of those essential characteristics agreed by the manufacturer and the TAB receiving the request for the European Technical Assessment for the declared intended use, and technical details necessary for the implementation of the system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance.\n3.   In order to ensure the uniform implementation of this Article, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish the format of the European Technical Assessment in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 64(2).\nArticle 27\nLevels or classes of performance\n1.   The Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 60, to establish classes of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products.\n2.   Where the Commission has established classes of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products, the European standardisation bodies shall use those classes in harmonised standards. The organisation of TABs shall where relevant use those classes in European Assessment Documents.\nWhere classes of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products are not established by the Commission, they may be established by the European standardisation bodies in harmonised standards, on the basis of a revised mandate.\n3.   When provided for in the relevant mandates, the European standardisation bodies shall establish in harmonised standards threshold levels in relation to essential characteristics and, when appropriate, for intended uses, to be fulfilled by construction products in Member States.\n4.   Where the European standardisation bodies have established classes of performance in a harmonised standard, the organisation of TABs shall use those classes in the European Assessment Documents where they are relevant for the construction product.\nWhen deemed appropriate, the organisation of TABs may, with the agreement of the Commission and after consulting the Standing Committee on Construction, establish in the European Assessment Document classes of performance and threshold levels in relation to the essential characteristics of a construction product within its intended use as foreseen by the manufacturer.\n5.   The Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 60, to establish conditions under which a construction product shall be deemed to satisfy a certain level or class of performance without testing or without further testing.\nWhere such conditions are not established by the Commission, they may be established by the European standardisation bodies in harmonised standards, on the basis of a revised mandate.\n6.   When the Commission has established classification systems in accordance with paragraph 1, Member States may determine the levels or classes of performance to be respected by construction products in relation to their essential characteristics only in accordance with those classification systems.\n7.   The European standardisation bodies and the organisation of TABs shall respect the regulatory needs of Member States when determining threshold levels or classes of performance.\nArticle 28\nAssessment and verification of constancy of performance\n1.   Assessment and verification of constancy of performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics shall be carried out in accordance with one of the systems set out in Annex V.\n2.   By means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 60, the Commission shall establish and may revise, taking into account in particular the effect on the health and safety of people, and on the environment, which system or systems are applicable to a given construction product or family of construction products or a given essential characteristic. In doing so, the Commission shall also take into account the documented experiences forwarded by national authorities with regard to market surveillance.\nThe Commission shall choose the least onerous system or systems consistent with the fulfilment of all basic requirements for construction works.\n3.   The system or systems thus determined shall be indicated in the mandates for harmonised standards and in the harmonised technical specifications.\nCHAPTER V\nTECHNICAL ASSESSMENT BODIES\nArticle 29\nDesignation, monitoring and evaluation of TABs\n1.

Any agreements and contracts resulting from this Regulation shall provide for monitoring and financial control by the Commission or any representative which it authorises and for audits by the Court of Auditors, which, if necessary, may be conducted on-the-spot.\nCHAPTER VI\nSIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES\nArticle 36\nUse of Appropriate Technical Documentation\n1.   In determining the product-type, a manufacturer may replace type-testing or type-calculation by Appropriate Technical Documentation demonstrating that:\n(a)\nfor one or several essential characteristics of the construction product, which the manufacturer places on the market, that product is deemed to achieve a certain level or class of performance without testing or calculation, or without further testing or calculation, in accordance with the conditions set out in the relevant harmonised technical specification or a Commission decision;\n(b)\nthe construction product, covered by a harmonised standard, which the manufacturer places on the market corresponds to the product-type of another construction product, manufactured by another manufacturer and already tested in accordance with the relevant harmonised standard. When these conditions are fulfilled, the manufacturer is entitled to declare performance corresponding to all or part of the test results of this other product. The manufacturer may use the test results obtained by another manufacturer only after having obtained an authorisation of that manufacturer, who remains responsible for the accuracy, reliability and stability of those test results; or\n(c)\nthe construction product, covered by a harmonised technical specification, which the manufacturer places on the market is a system made of components, which the manufacturer assembles duly following precise instructions given by the provider of such a system or of a component thereof, who has already tested that system or that component for one or several of its essential characteristics in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specification. When these conditions are fulfilled, the manufacturer is entitled to declare performance corresponding to all or part of the test results for the system or the component provided to him. The manufacturer may use the test results obtained by another manufacturer or system provider only after having obtained an authorisation of that manufacturer or system provider, who remains responsible for the accuracy, reliability and stability of those test results.\n2.   If the construction product referred to in paragraph 1 belongs to a family of construction products for which the applicable system for assessment and verification of constancy of performance is system 1 + or 1, as set out in Annex V, the Appropriate Technical Documentation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be verified by a notified product certification body as referred to in Annex V.\nArticle 37\nUse of simplified procedures by micro-enterprises\nMicro-enterprises manufacturing construction products covered by a harmonised standard may replace the determination of the product-type on the basis of type-testing for the applicable systems 3 and 4 as set out in Annex V by using methods differing from those contained in the applicable harmonised standard. Those manufacturers may also treat construction products to which system 3 applies in accordance with provisions for system 4. When a manufacturer uses these simplified procedures, the manufacturer shall demonstrate compliance of the construction product with the applicable requirements by means of a Specific Technical Documentation and shall demonstrate the equivalence of the procedures used to the procedures laid down in the harmonised standards.\nArticle 38\nOther simplified procedures\n1.   In relation to construction products covered by a harmonised standard and which are individually manufactured or custom-made in a non-series process in response to a specific order, and which are installed in a single identified construction work, the performance assessment part of the applicable system, as set out in Annex V, may be replaced by the manufacturer by Specific Technical Documentation demonstrating compliance of that product with the applicable requirements and equivalence of the procedures used to the procedures laid down in the harmonised standards.\n2.   If the construction product referred to in paragraph 1 belongs to a family of construction products for which the applicable system for assessment and verification of constancy of performance is system 1 + or 1, as set out in Annex V, the Specific Technical Documentation shall be verified by a notified product certification body as referred to in Annex V.\nCHAPTER VII\nNOTIFYING AUTHORITIES AND NOTIFIED BODIES\nArticle 39\nNotification\nMember States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of bodies authorised to carry out third-party tasks in the process of assessment and verification of constancy of performance under this Regulation (hereinafter referred to as ‘notified bodies’).\nArticle 40\nNotifying authorities\n1.

Where the body concerned cannot provide an accreditation certificate, it shall provide the notifying authority with all documentary evidence necessary for the verification, recognition and regular monitoring of its compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 43.\nArticle 48\nNotification procedure\n1.   Notifying authorities may notify only bodies which have satisfied the requirements laid down in Article 43.\n2.   They shall notify the Commission and the other Member States, notably using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission.\nExceptionally, for cases set out in point 3 of Annex V, for which the appropriate electronic tool is not available, a hard copy of the notification shall be accepted.\n3.   The notification shall include full details of the functions to be performed, reference to the relevant harmonised technical specification and, for the purposes of the system set out in Annex V, the essential characteristics for which the body is competent.\nHowever, reference to the relevant harmonised technical specification is not required in the cases set out in point 3 of Annex V.\n4.   Where a notification is not based on an accreditation certificate as referred to in Article 47(2), the notifying authority shall provide the Commission and the other Member States with all documentary evidence which attests to the notified body’s competence and the arrangements in place to ensure that that body will be monitored regularly and will continue to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 43.\n5.   The body concerned may perform the activities of a notified body only where no objections are raised by the Commission or the other Member States within 2 weeks of notification where an accreditation certificate is used or within 2 months of notification where an accreditation certificate is not used.\nOnly such a body shall be considered as a notified body for the purpose of this Regulation.\n6.   The Commission and the other Member States shall be notified of any subsequent relevant changes to the notification.\nArticle 49\nIdentification numbers and lists of notified bodies\n1.   The Commission shall assign an identification number to each notified body.\nIt shall assign a single such number even where the body is notified under several Union acts.\n2.   The Commission shall make publicly available the list of bodies notified under this Regulation, including the identification numbers that have been allocated to them and the activities for which they have been notified, notably using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission.\nThe Commission shall ensure that this list is kept up-to-date.\nArticle 50\nChanges to the notification\n1.   Where a notifying authority has ascertained or has been informed that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in Article 43, or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the notifying authority shall restrict, suspend or withdraw the notification as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or to fulfil those obligations. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly, notably using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission.\n2.   In the event of withdrawal, restriction or suspension of notification or where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying Member State concerned shall take the appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that body are either processed by another notified body or kept available for the responsible notifying and market surveillance authorities at their request.\nArticle 51\nChallenge of the competence of notified bodies\n1.   The Commission shall investigate all cases where it doubts, or doubt is brought to its attention regarding, the competence of a notified body or the continued fulfilment by a notified body of the requirements and responsibilities to which it is subject.\n2.

Notified bodies shall carry out third party tasks in accordance with the systems of assessment and verification of constancy of performance provided for in Annex V.\n2.   Assessments and verifications of constancy of performance shall be carried out with transparency as regards the manufacturer, and in a proportionate manner, avoiding an unnecessary burden for economic operators. The notified bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of the undertaking, the sector in which the undertaking operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process.\nIn so doing, the notified bodies shall nevertheless respect the degree of rigour required for the product by this Regulation and the part played by the product for the fulfilment of all basic requirements for construction works.\n3.   Where, in the course of the initial inspection of the manufacturing plant and of factory production control, a notified body finds that the manufacturer has not ensured the constancy of performance of the manufactured product, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall not issue a certificate.\n4.   Where, in the course of the monitoring activity aiming at the verification of the constancy of performance of the manufactured product, a notified body finds that a construction product no longer has the same performance to that of the product-type, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall suspend or withdraw its certificate if necessary.\n5.   Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any certificates, as appropriate.\nArticle 53\nInformation obligations for notified bodies\n1.   Notified bodies shall inform the notifying authority of the following:\n(a)\nany refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of certificates;\n(b)\nany circumstances affecting the scope of, and conditions for, notification;\n(c)\nany request for information on assessment and/or verification of constancy of performance activities carried out which they have received from market surveillance authorities;\n(d)\non request, third party tasks in accordance with the systems of assessment and verification of constancy of performance carried out within the scope of their notification and any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and subcontracting.\n2.   Notified bodies shall provide the other bodies notified under this Regulation carrying out similar third party tasks in accordance with the systems of assessment and verification of constancy of performance and for construction products covered by the same harmonised technical specification with relevant information on issues relating to negative and, on request, positive results from these assessments and/or verifications.\nArticle 54\nExchange of experience\nThe Commission shall provide for the organisation of exchange of experience between the Member States’ national authorities responsible for policy on notification.\nArticle 55\nCoordination of notified bodies\nThe Commission shall ensure that appropriate coordination and cooperation between bodies notified pursuant to Article 39 are put into place and properly operated in the form of a group of notified bodies.\nMember States shall ensure that the bodies notified by them participate in the work of that group, directly or by means of designated representatives, or shall ensure that the representatives of notified bodies are informed thereof.\nCHAPTER VIII\nMARKET SURVEILLANCE AND SAFEGUARD PROCEDURES\nArticle 56\nProcedure to deal at national level with construction products presenting a risk\n1.   Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have taken action pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or where they have sufficient reason to believe that a construction product covered by a harmonised standard or for which a European Technical Assessment has been issued does not achieve the declared performance and presents a risk for the fulfilment of the basic requirements for construction works covered by this Regulation, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the product concerned covering the respective requirements laid down by this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities.\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authorities find that the construction product does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the product into compliance with those requirements, notably with the declared performance, or to withdraw the product from the market, or recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the notified body accordingly, if a notified body is involved.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that the non-compliance is not limited to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the construction products concerned which that economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator, within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, does not take adequate corrective action, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the making available of the construction product on the national market or to withdraw the construction product from that market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n5.   The information referred to in paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant construction product, the origin of the construction product, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of national measures taken as well as the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either of the following:\n(a)\nfailure of the product to achieve the declared performance and/or to meet the requirements related to the fulfilment of basic requirements for construction works laid down in this Regulation;\n(b)\nshortcomings in the harmonised technical specifications or in the Specific Technical Documentation.\n6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the construction product concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within 15 working days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State in relation to the construction product concerned, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken without delay in respect of the construction product concerned, such as withdrawal of the product from their market.\nArticle 57\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 56(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator(s) and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not.\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator(s).\n2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant construction product is withdrawn from their markets and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.\n3.   Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the construction product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards as referred to in Article 56(5)(b), the Commission shall inform the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and shall bring the matter before the Committee set up pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC. That Committee shall consult with the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and deliver its opinion without delay.\nWhere the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the construction product is attributed to shortcomings in the European Assessment Document or in the Specific Technical Documentation as referred to in Article 56(5)(b), the Commission shall bring the matter before the Standing Committee on Construction and subsequently adopt the appropriate measures.\nArticle 58\nComplying construction products which nevertheless present a risk to health and safety\n1.   Where, having performed an evaluation pursuant to Article 56(1), a Member State finds that, although a construction product is in compliance with this Regulation, it presents a risk for the fulfilment of the basic requirements for construction works, to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the construction product concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the construction product from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, which it may prescribe.\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that any corrective action is taken in respect of all the construction products concerned which that economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the construction product concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the product, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator(s) and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures.\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator(s).\nArticle 59\nFormal non-compliance\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 56, where a Member State makes one of the following findings, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned:\n(a)\nthe CE marking has been affixed in breach of Article 8 or 9;\n(b)\nthe CE marking has not been affixed, when required, in accordance with Article 8(2);\n(c)\nwithout prejudice to Article 5, the declaration of performance has not been drawn up, when required, in accordance with Article 4;\n(d)\nthe declaration of performance has not been drawn up in accordance with Articles 4, 6 and 7;\n(e)\nthe technical documentation is either not available or not complete.\n2.   Where the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 1 continues, the Member State shall take all appropriate measures to restrict or prohibit the making available on the market of the construction product or ensure that it is recalled or withdrawn from the market.\nCHAPTER IX\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 60\nDelegated acts\nFor the purposes of achieving the objectives of this Regulation, in particular removing and avoiding restrictions on making construction products available on the market, the following matters shall be delegated to the Commission in accordance with Article 61, and subject to the conditions laid down in Articles 62 and 63:\n(a)\nthe determination, where appropriate, of the essential characteristics or threshold levels within specific families of construction products, in relation to which, in accordance with Articles 3 to 6, the manufacturer shall declare, in relation to their intended use, by levels or classes, or in a description, the performance of the manufacturer’s product when it is placed on the market;\n(b)\nthe conditions on which a declaration of performance may be electronically processed, in order to make it available on a web site in accordance with Article 7;\n(c)\nthe amendment of the period for which the manufacturer shall keep the technical documentation and the declaration of performance after the construction product has been placed on the market, in accordance with Article 11, based on the expected life or the part played by the construction product in the construction works;\n(d)\nthe amendment of Annex II and where necessary the adoption of supplementary procedural rules in accordance with Article 19(3) in order to ensure compliance with the principles in Article 20, or the application in practice of the procedures set out in Article 21;\n(e)\nthe adaptation of Annex III, table 1 of Annex IV, and Annex V in response to technical progress;\n(f)\nthe establishment and adaptation of classes of performance in response to technical progress in accordance with Article 27(1);\n(g)\nthe conditions on which a construction product shall be deemed to satisfy a certain level or class of performance without testing or without further testing in accordance with Article 27(5), provided that the fulfilment of the basic requirements for construction works is not thereby jeopardised;\n(h)\nthe adaptation, establishment and revision of the systems of assessment and verification of constancy of performance in accordance with Article 28, relating to a given product, a given product family or a given essential characteristic, and in accordance with:\n(i)\nthe importance of the part played by the product or those essential characteristics with respect to the basic requirements for construction works;\n(ii)\nthe nature of the product;\n(iii)\nthe effect of the variability of the essential characteristics of the construction product during the expected life of the product; and\n(iv)\nthe susceptibility to defects in the product’s manufacture.\nArticle 61\nExercise of the delegation\n1.

Subject to normal maintenance, construction works must satisfy these basic requirements for construction works for an economically reasonable working life.\n1.   Mechanical resistance and stability\nThe construction works must be designed and built in such a way that the loadings that are liable to act on them during their constructions and use will not lead to any of the following:\n(a)\ncollapse of the whole or part of the work;\n(b)\nmajor deformations to an inadmissible degree;\n(c)\ndamage to other parts of the construction works or to fittings or installed equipment as a result of major deformation of the load-bearing construction;\n(d)\ndamage by an event to an extent disproportionate to the original cause.\n2.   Safety in case of fire\nThe construction works must be designed and built in such a way that in the event of an outbreak of fire:\n(a)\nthe load-bearing capacity of the construction can be assumed for a specific period of time;\n(b)\nthe generation and spread of fire and smoke within the construction works are limited;\n(c)\nthe spread of fire to neighbouring construction works is limited;\n(d)\noccupants can leave the construction works or be rescued by other means;\n(e)\nthe safety of rescue teams is taken into consideration.\n3.   Hygiene, health and the environment\nThe construction works must be designed and built in such a way that they will, throughout their life cycle, not be a threat to the hygiene or health and safety of workers, occupants or neighbours, nor have an exceedingly high impact, over their entire life cycle, on the environmental quality or on the climate during their construction, use and demolition, in particular as a result of any of the following:\n(a)\nthe giving-off of toxic gas;\n(b)\nthe emissions of dangerous substances, volatile organic compounds (VOC), greenhouse gases or dangerous particles into indoor or outdoor air;\n(c)\nthe emission of dangerous radiation;\n(d)\nthe release of dangerous substances into ground water, marine waters, surface waters or soil;\n(e)\nthe release of dangerous substances into drinking water or substances which have an otherwise negative impact on drinking water;\n(f)\nfaulty discharge of waste water, emission of flue gases or faulty disposal of solid or liquid waste;\n(g)\ndampness in parts of the construction works or on surfaces within the construction works.\n4.   Safety and accessibility in use\nThe construction works must be designed and built in such a way that they do not present unacceptable risks of accidents or damage in service or in operation such as slipping, falling, collision, burns, electrocution, injury from explosion and burglaries. In particular, construction works must be designed and built taking into consideration accessibility and use for disabled persons.\n5.   Protection against noise\nThe construction works must be designed and built in such a way that noise perceived by the occupants or people nearby is kept to a level that will not threaten their health and will allow them to sleep, rest and work in satisfactory conditions.\n6.   Energy economy and heat retention\nThe construction works and their heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation installations must be designed and built in such a way that the amount of energy they require in use shall be low, when account is taken of the occupants and of the climatic conditions of the location. Construction works must also be energy-efficient, using as little energy as possible during their construction and dismantling.\n7.   Sustainable use of natural resources\nThe construction works must be designed, built and demolished in such a way that the use of natural resources is sustainable and in particular ensure the following:\n(a)\nreuse or recyclability of the construction works, their materials and parts after demolition;\n(b)\ndurability of the construction works;\n(c)\nuse of environmentally compatible raw and secondary materials in the construction works.\nANNEX II\nPROCEDURE FOR ADOPTING A EUROPEAN ASSESSMENT DOCUMENT\n1.   Request for a European Technical Assessment\nWhen a manufacturer makes a request for a European Technical Assessment to any TAB for a construction product, and after the manufacturer and the TAB (hereinafter referred to as the ‘responsible TAB’) have signed an agreement of commercial secrecy and confidentiality, unless the manufacturer decides otherwise, the manufacturer shall submit to the responsible TAB a technical file describing the product, its use as foreseen by the manufacturer and details of the factory production control the manufacturer intends to apply.\n2.   Contract\nFor construction products referred to in Article 21(1)(c), within 1 month from the reception of the technical file, a contract shall be concluded between the manufacturer and the responsible TAB for the production of the European Technical Assessment, defining the work programme for drawing up the European Assessment Document, including:\n—\nthe organisation of work within the organisation of TABs,\n—\nthe composition of the workgroup to be established within the organisation of TABs, designated for the product area in question,\n—\nthe coordination of TABs.\n3.

Where manufacturers consider that the product no longer conforms with the Declaration of Performance, they must immediately take the necessary corrective measures or withdraw or recall the product from the market.\nImporters must:\nensure that the product bears CE marking and is accompanied by the required documentation;\navoid placing the product on the market if they consider it is not in conformity with the Declaration of Performance;\nensure that the product maintains its conformity with the Declaration of Performance and that its transport or storage do not jeopardise its performance. Where a product does not conform with the Declaration of Performance, importers must immediately take the necessary corrective measures or withdraw or recall the product from the market.\nObligations of distributors include:\nensuring that the product bears CE marking and that it is accompanied by the required documentation;\nnot making the product available on the market if they consider it does not conform with the Declaration of Performance, until it is brought into conformity or until the Declaration of Performance is corrected;\nensuring that the product’s transport or storage do not jeopardise its performance. Where a product does not conform with its Declaration of Performance, distributors must ensure the necessary corrective measures are taken, or that the product is withdrawn or recalled from the market.\nHarmonised technical specifications\nHarmonised technical specifications include harmonised standards and European Assessment Documents. Harmonised standards are drawn up by European standardisation bodies (European Committee for Standardization or European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) on the basis of requests issued by the European Commission. Harmonised standards define the methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of construction products.\nIf a construction product is not covered or not fully covered by a harmonised standard, manufacturers may request a European Technical Assessment, issued by one of the Technical Assessment Bodies on the basis of a European Assessment Document developed by the European Organisation for Technical Assessment.The European Technical Assessment is a documented assessment of the performance of a construction product, in relation to its essential characteristics.\nHarmonised standards and European Technical Assessments create a common technical language used by all players in the construction sector and enable manufacturers to draw up the Declaration of Performance and affix the CE marking. References of harmonised standards and of European Assessment Documents are published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nMarket surveillance\nEU countries’ market surveillance authorities, established under to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, must ensure that the regulation is complied with in their countries.\nWhere these authorities find that a product does not comply with the requirements of the regulation (e.g., the product does not achieve its declared performance and presents a risk), they must without delay require the relevant economic operator to bring the product into compliance with the declared performance, or to withdraw the product from the market, or recall it within a reasonable period, appropriate to the nature of the risk.\nImplementing and delegated acts\nA list of implementing and delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with the Construction Products Regulation is available on the Commission’s website.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 July 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe approach of the Construction Products Regulation for a better functioning single market for construction products is different from the general principles originally set in the New Legislative Framework. The main differences are:\nThe division of powers between the EU and EU countries: the EU deals only with the single market access rules and not with requirements for products' performance itself. The EU countries are those who are responsible for fire safety, environmental, energy and other requirements applicable to construction works.\nHarmonised marketing conditions: instead of harmonising construction products or the requirements for them, the Construction Products Regulation limits itself to creating harmonised conditions for marketing such products.\nThe use of harmonised standards is obligatory for manufacturers when placing their construction products on the market and for EU countries when setting requirements for their performance.\nFollowing the publication of the July 2016 Implementation Report, the Commission's Communication ‘Clean Energy for all Europeans’ announced a possible revision of the Construction Products Regulation in November 2016.\nFor more information, see:\nReview of the construction products regulation (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nConstruction product: any product or kit which is produced and placed on the market for incorporation in a permanent manner in construction works or parts thereof and the performance of which has an effect on the performance of the construction works with respect to the basic requirements for construction works.\nPerformance of a construction product: the performance related to the relevant essential characteristics, expressed by level or class, or in a description.\nConstruction works: buildings and civil engineering works.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, pp. 5-43)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 have been incorporated in the original text.
