Elements of preventive medicine, notably individual and collective hygiene, and elements of possible prophylactic measures.  3. Ability to perform basic types of treatment and supervise emergency disembarkation at sea.  Person responsible for treatment aboard category A vessels should if possible receive their practical training in hospitals.  4. Detailed knowledge of how to use the various remote medical consultation facilities.  II. This training should take account of the programmes of instruction detailed in relevant recent international documents.", "summary": "Medical treatment on board vessels\nMedical treatment on board vessels\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 92/29/EEC on the minimum safety and health requirements for improved medical treatment on board vessels\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt aims to ensure that minimum safety and health systems are in place to improve medical treatment on board vessels.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nEach European Union (EU) Member State should ensure that vessels registered in that country, or flying its flag, carries medical supplies. The detailed requirements depend on the category of vessel and the details listed in the annexes to the directive. In addition:\nevery vessel should carry a watertight medicine chest for each of its lifeboats;\nevery vessel of more than 500 gross tonnes, with a crew of 15 or more, on a voyage of more than 3 days, must have a suitable sickbay in which medical treatment can be given;\nevery vessel with a crew of 100 or more on an international voyage of more than 3 days must have a doctor on board.\nAny vessel transporting dangerous substances must carry the appropriate antidotes. Ferries must in any case carry a minimum of antidotes (as outlined in Annex II) to allow for the fact that the carriage of dangerous substances may not be known in advance, unless the regular crossing is under 2 hours. All available antidotes and medical supplies must be detailed on a checklist.\nOther obligations\nThe owner is responsible for providing the medical supplies. The captain, or a delegated representative, is responsible for the management of supplies, which must be kept in good condition and replenished systematically at the owner’s sole expense.\nThe medical supplies must be accompanied by instructions as to their use, including information relating to the use of the required antidotes.\nProfessional maritime training must include basic first response medical training in the event of an accident or serious medical emergency.
