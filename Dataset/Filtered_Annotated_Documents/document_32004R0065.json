Directive as last amended by Directive 2001/18/EC.(4) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1.ANNEXFORMATS FOR UNIQUE IDENTIFIERSThe Annex below defines the format for the unique identifier for plants in Section A and for micro-organisms and animals in Section B.SECTION A1. Overall formatThis Annex provides details as to the format to be used for unique identifiers for GMOs pending or authorised for the placing on the market under Community legislation. The format consists of three components comprising a number of alphanumeric digits and providing reference to the applicant/consent holder, transformation event and a means for verification.The format comprises nine alphanumeric digits in total. The first component represents the applicant/consent holder and comprises two or three alphanumeric digits. The second component comprises five or six alphanumeric digits and represents the transformation event. The third component provides for verification and is represented by a final numerical digit.The following provides an example of a unique identifier developed using this format.>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000802.TIF\">or>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000803.TIF\">The following sections provide guidance as to how the three individual components of the unique identifier should be developed.2. Applicant/consent holder componentThe first two or three alphanumeric digits represent the applicant/consent holder (for example, the first two or three letters of the applicant/consent holder organisation name), followed by a dash, such;>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000804.TIF\">or>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000805.TIF\">Applicants may already have assigned alphanumeric digits to indicate their identity and these appear in the applicant's code table within the OECD BioTrack product database. These applicants should continue to use these digits.Any new applicant that is not identified within the database will not be permitted to use the existing codes listed in the applicant's code table within the database. The new applicant Should inform the national authorities, which should update the OECD BioTrack product database by including a new code (digits) that will be designed to identify the new applicant in the code table.3. Transformation event componentThe second set of five or six alphanumerical digits should represent the specific transformation event(s), which is the subject of the application for the placing on the market and/or consent, such as:>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000806.TIF\">or>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000807.TIF\">Clearly, an individual transformation event may occur in different organisms, species and varieties and the digits should be representative of the specific event in question. Again, applicants should, prior to formulating unique identifiers, consult the OECD BioTrack product database in terms of the unique identifiers that have been assigned to similar transformation events of the same organism/species in order to provide consistency and to avoid duplication.Applicants should develop their own internal mechanism to avoid applying the same designation (digits) to a \"transformation event\" if used in a different organism. Where similar transformation events are developed by two or more organisations, the \"applicant information\" (see section 2) should enable applicants to generate a unique identifier for their own product, while at the same time ensuring its uniqueness from those generated by other applicants.As regards new GMOs compromising more than one transformation event (often referred to as stacked-gene transformation events), applicants or consent holders should generate a novel unique identifier for such GMOs.4. Verification componentThe final digit of the unique identifier is for verification, which shall be separated from the rest of the unique identifier digits by a dash, such as:>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000901.TIF\">or>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000902.TIF\">The verification digit is intended to reduce errors by ensuring the integrity of the alphanumeric identifier, entered by the users of the database.The rule to calculate the verification digit is as follows. The verification digit is made up of a single numerical digit. It is calculated by adding together the numerical values of each of the alphanumerical digits in the unique identifier. The numerical value of each of the digits is from>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000903.TIF\">to 9 for the numerical digits (>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000904.TIF\">to 9) and 1 to 26 for the alphabetical digits (A to Z) (see sections 5 and 6). The total sum, if made up of several numerical digits, will be further calculated by adding the remaining digits together using the same rule, in an iterative process, until the final sum is a single numerical digit.For example, the verification digit for the code CED-AB891 is calculated as follows:>TABLE>Therefore, the final unique identifier then becomes - CED-AB891-6.5. Form of digits to be used in the unique identifier>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.000905.TIF\">6. Form of alphabetic characters to be used, plus numerical equivalents for calculating verification digit.>PIC FILE= \"L_2004010EN.001001.TIF\">SECTION BThe provisions of section A of this Annex shall apply to micro-organisms and animals unless another format for a unique identifier is adopted internationally and endorsed at Community level.", "summary": "Genetically modified organisms â unique identifiers\nGenetically modified organisms â unique identifiers\nSUMMARY OF:\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 on unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?\n                \n              \nThe regulation establishes a unique identifier*, similar to a barcode, specific to each genetically modified organism* (GMO) brought to market. This is a key element in the traceability* and labelling of food and animal feed derived from GMOs, aiming to improve consumer choice and provide safeguards to health and the environment.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nFor consistency with developments in international fora, a unique identifier format is used by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development BioTrack database and by the Biosafety Clearing-House of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity.\nFor each new application for the authorisation of a GMO to be put on the market, the applicant must check in the databases to make sure that an identifier has not already been assigned before creating a unique identifier in the prescribed format.\nWhere authorisation is granted for a GMO to be put on the market, the unique identifier is then communicated to the Biosafety Clearing-House by the European Commission and recorded in the EU register of authorised GMOs.\nAll GMOs authorised before the regulation came into force have been assigned unique identifiers under the regulation.\nThe format of the unique identifier is defined in the annex to the regulation, and consists of nine alphanumeric digits. The first two or three digits represent the company or organisation name. The second component of five or six digits represents the transformation event* and the final component is a single verification digit, all separated by a dash, for example: MON-00603-1.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 16 January 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see âTraceability and labellingâ on the European Commissionâs website.\nKEY TERMS\n* Unique identifier: a 9-digit alphanumeric code specific to a GMO enabling it to be readily identified on a productâs labelling.\n* Genetically modified organisms: plants or animals bred to give higher yield or resist disease, through modification of their cellular and genetic make-up.\n* Traceability: the ability to track GMOs, and products produced from GMOs, at all stages of the production and distribution chain, facilitating accurate labelling.\n* Transformation event: a term used to differentiate genetically engineered (transformed) crop varieties and other organisms.\nACT\n            \nCommission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (OJ L 10, 16.1.2004, pp. 5-10)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nCommission Regulation (EC) No 641/2004 of 6 April 2004 on detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the application for the authorisation of new genetically modified food and feed, the notification of existing products and adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified material which has benefited from a favourable risk evaluation (OJ L 102, 7.4.2004, pp. 14-25).\nSuccessive amendments to Commission Regulation (EC) No 641/2004 have been incorporated into the original text.
