To this end, it is vital that the various categories of the CPA be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States.\n(7)\nReliable and comparable statistics are necessary to enable enterprises to assess their competitiveness, and are useful to the Community institutions in preventing distortions of competition.\n(8)\nThe establishment of a common statistical classification of products by economic activity does not per se oblige Member States to collect, publish or supply data. Only if the Member States use product classifications linked to the Community classification is it possible to provide integrated information with the reliability, speed, flexibility and degree of detail required for the management of the internal market.\n(9)\nProvision should be made to enable the Member States, in order to meet their national requirements, to integrate into their national classifications additional categories based on the CPA.\n(10)\nThe international comparability of economic statistics requires that the Member States and the Community institutions use classifications of products which are directly linked to the Central Product Classification (CPC) Ver. 2, as adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission.\n(11)\nUse of the CPA requires that the Commission be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (3) in particular as regards examining problems arising from the implementation of the CPA and incorporating amendments to the CPA.\n(12)\nThe establishment of a new statistical classification of products implies a need to amend specifically references to the CPA. It is therefore necessary to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93.\n(13)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4). In particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend the CPA in order to take account of technological or economic developments and align it with other economic and social classifications. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(14)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a new CPA, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(15)\nThe Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation establishes a new common CPA within the Community in order to ensure relevance with respect to the economic reality and comparability between national, Community and international classifications and hence national, Community and international statistics.\n2.   The term ‘product’ shall refer to outputs of economic activities, whether goods or services.\n3.   This Regulation shall apply to the use of the classification for statistical purposes only.\nArticle 2\nThe levels and the structure of the CPA\n1.   The CPA shall comprise:\n(a)\na first level, comprising headings identified by an alphabetical code (sections);\n(b)\na second level, comprising headings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions);\n(c)\na third level, comprising headings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups);\n(d)\na fourth level, comprising headings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes);\n(e)\na fifth level, comprising headings identified by a five-digit numerical code (categories); and\n(f)\na sixth level, comprising headings identified by a six-digit numerical code (subcategories).\n2.   The CPA is set out in the Annex.\nArticle 3\nUse of the CPA\nThe Commission shall use the CPA for all statistics classified according to products by activity.\nArticle 4\nNational classifications of products by economic activity\n1.   Member States may use the CPA for aggregated or detailed, national, specific or functional adaptation based on the subcategories of the CPA.\n2.   Those classifications shall be related to the CPA in accordance with the following rules:\n(a)\nclassifications that are more aggregated than the CPA shall comprise precise aggregations of CPA subcategories;\n(b)\nclassifications that are more detailed than the CPA shall comprise headings that are wholly contained within CPA subcategories.\nThe classifications that are derived in accordance with this paragraph may have a different coding.\n3.   Member States may use a national classification of products by economic activity derived from the CPA. In such a case, they shall forward to the Commission drafts defining their national classification. Within three months after receiving such a draft, the Commission shall verify the conformity of the envisaged national classification with paragraph 2 and shall transmit it to the other Member States for information. The Member States’ national classifications shall include a table of correspondence with the CPA.\nArticle 5\nCommission activities\nThe Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall ensure the dissemination, maintenance and promotion of the CPA, in particular by:\n(a)\ndrafting, updating and publishing explanatory notes relating to the CPA;\n(b)\ndrawing up and publishing guidelines for the application of the CPA;\n(c)\npublishing tables of correspondence between the new version and the previous version of the CPA; the previous version and the new version of the CPA; and the CPA and the Combined Nomenclature (CN), which is reproduced in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (5); and\n(d)\nworking to improve consistency with other classifications.\nArticle 6\nImplementing measures\n1.   The following measures, designed to implement and update this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 7(2):\n(a)\ndecisions required in case of problems arising from implementing the CPA, including the assignment of products to specific classes; and\n(b)\ntechnical measures ensuring a fully coordinated transition from the previous version of the CPA.\n2.   The following measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 7(3):\n(a)\namendments to the CPA designed to take account of technological or economic developments; and\n(b)\namendments to the CPA designed to align it with other economic and social classifications.\n3.   Consideration is to be given to the principle that the benefits of updating the CPA must outweigh its costs, and to the principle that additional costs and burden remain within a reasonable limit.\nArticle 7\nCommittee\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nArticle 8\nRepeal of Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93\nRegulation (EEC) No 3696/93 shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2008.\nArticle 9\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 23 April 2008.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

activity\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 451/2008 — new statistical classification of products by activity\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt introduces a new statistical classification of products (both goods and services) by activity (CPA) in the EU, replacing and repealing a previous classification from 1993.\nThe CPA seeks to contribute to better economic governance at both EU and national levels by providing more comparable and relevant data.\nKEY POINTS\nProduct classifications categorise products that have common characteristics. They are the basis for collecting and calculating statistics on the production, distribution, consumption, international trade and transport of these products.\nCPA product categories are linked to activities as defined by the EU’s statistical classification of economic activities (NACE*). Each CPA product is assigned to a given NACE activity, meaning that the CPA’s structure is consistent with that of NACE’s at all levels.\nThe CPA is in correspondence with the United Nation's products and services classification, the Central Product Classification (CPC). This makes it possible to compare statistics across countries and in different fields.\nThe CPA has a six-level hierarchical structure. Each level can be identified by means of a specific code. First level: 21 sections (alphabetical code), e.g. A: Products of agriculture, forestry and fishing.Second level: 88 divisions (two-digit numerical code), e.g. 01: Products of agriculture, hunting and related services.Third level: 262 groups (three-digit numerical code), e.g. 01.1: Non-perennial crops.Fourth level: 576 classes (four-digit numerical code), e.g. 01.11: Cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds.Fifth level: 1 357 categories (five-digit numerical code), e.g. 01.11.1: Wheat.Sixth level: 3 218 subcategories (six-digit numerical code), e.g. 01.11.11: Durum wheat and 01.11.12: Wheat, except durum wheat.\nThe CPA is set out in the annex.\nThe European Commission may adopt measures for the implementation of this regulation, including ones designed to adapt it to economic and technological developments or to align it with other economic or social classifications.\nIn 2009, the European Statistical System Committee replaced the Statistical Programme Committee. It is responsible for supporting the Commission in implementing this regulation. It comprises EU countries’ representatives and is chaired by the Commission.\nThe annex to Regulation (EC) No 451/2008 was replaced by the text in the annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1209/2014 amending Regulation (EC) No 451/2008, commonly referred to as ‘CPA Version 2.1’.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nYour key to European statistics — Overview: CPA Ver. 2.1 (Eurostat).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nNACE: abbreviation of the name of the EU’s classification of economic activities which is derived from the French Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 451/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 establishing a new statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 (OJ L 145, 4.6.2008, pp. 65-226)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 451/2008 have been incorporated into the original text.
