{"celex_id": "32012R0649", "reference": "27.7.2012\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 201/60\nREGULATION (EU) No 649/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 4 July 2012\nconcerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) and Article 207 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 689/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals (3) has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 should be recast in the interest of clarity.\n(2)\nRegulation (EC) No 689/2008 implements the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (4) (the ‘Convention’), which entered into force on 24 February 2004, and replaces Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals (5).\n(3)\nFor reasons of clarity and consistency with other relevant Union legislation, certain definitions should be introduced or clarified and terminology should be aligned with that used in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and establishing a European Chemicals Agency (6), on the one hand, and Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (7) on the other hand. It is appropriate to ensure that this Regulation reflects the transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, in order to avoid any inconsistencies between the timetable of application of that Regulation and this Regulation.\n(4)\nThe Convention allows Parties the right to take action that is more stringently protective of human health and the environment than that called for in the Convention, provided that such action is consistent with the provisions of the Convention and is in accordance with international law. It is necessary and appropriate, in order to ensure a higher level of protection of the environment and the general public of importing countries, to go further than the provisions of the Convention in certain respects.\n(5)\nAs regards the participation of the Union in the Convention, it is essential to have a single contact point for Union interaction with the Secretariat of the Convention (the ‘Secretariat’) and other Parties to the Convention as well as with other countries. The Commission should act as that contact point.\n(6)\nThere is a need to ensure the effective coordination and management of technical and administrative aspects of this Regulation at Union level. The Member States and the European Chemicals Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (the ‘Agency’) have the competence and experience in implementing Union legislation on chemicals and international agreements on chemicals. The Member States and the Agency should, therefore, carry out tasks with regard to the administrative, technical and scientific aspects of the implementation of the Convention through this Regulation, as well as the exchange of information. In addition, the Commission, the Member States and the Agency should cooperate in order to implement the Union’s international obligations under the Convention effectively.\n(7)\nGiven that certain tasks of the Commission should be transferred to the Agency, the European Database on Export and Import of Dangerous Chemicals initially established by the Commission should be further developed and maintained by the Agency.\n(8)\nExports of hazardous chemicals that are banned or severely restricted within the Union should continue to be subject to a common export notification procedure. Accordingly, hazardous chemicals, whether in the form of substances on their own or in mixtures or in articles, which have been banned or severely restricted by the Union as plant protection products, as other forms of pesticides, or as industrial chemicals for use by professional users or by the public, should be subject to export notification rules similar to those applicable to such chemicals when they are banned or severely restricted within either or both of the use categories laid down in the Convention, namely as pesticides or chemicals for industrial use. In addition, chemicals subject to the international prior informed consent (PIC) procedure (the ‘PIC procedure’) should also be subject to the same export notification rules. That common export notification procedure should apply to Union exports to all third countries, whether or not they are Parties to the Convention or participate in its procedures. Member States should be permitted to charge administrative fees, in order to cover their costs in carrying out this procedure.\n(9)\nExporters and importers should be obliged to provide information concerning the quantities of chemicals in international trade covered by this Regulation so that the impact and effectiveness of the arrangements laid down therein can be monitored and assessed.\n(10)\nNotifications to the Secretariat of Union or Member State final regulatory actions banning or severely restricting chemicals, with a view to their inclusion in the PIC procedure, should be submitted by the Commission in cases where the criteria laid down in the Convention in this regard are met. Additional information to support such notifications should be sought where necessary.\n(11)\nIn cases where Union or Member State final regulatory actions do not qualify for notification because they do not meet the criteria laid down in the Convention, information concerning the actions should nevertheless be conveyed to the Secretariat and other Parties to the Convention in the interests of exchange of information.\n(12)\nIt is also necessary to ensure that the Union takes decisions with regard to the import into the Union of chemicals that are subject to the PIC procedure. These decisions should be based on applicable Union legislation and take into account bans or severe restrictions imposed by Member States. Where justified, amendments to Union legislation should be proposed.\n(13)\nArrangements are needed to ensure that Member States and exporters are aware of the decisions of importing countries as regards chemicals that are subject to the PIC procedure, and that exporters comply with those decisions. Furthermore, in order to prevent undesired exports, no chemicals banned or severely restricted within the Union that meet the criteria for notification under the Convention or that are subject to the PIC procedure should be exported unless the explicit consent of the importing country concerned has been sought and obtained, whether or not that country is a Party to the Convention. At the same time, an exemption from this obligation is appropriate in relation to exports of certain chemicals to countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) provided that certain conditions are met. Furthermore, a procedure is needed to deal with cases in which, despite all reasonable efforts, no response is obtained from the importing country, so that exports of certain chemicals may proceed on a temporary basis under specified conditions. It is also necessary to provide for periodic review of all such cases as well as those in which explicit consent is obtained.\n(14)\nIt is also important that all chemicals exported have an adequate shelf-life so that they may be used effectively and safely. As regards pesticides, in particular those exported to developing countries, it is essential that information about appropriate storage conditions be provided and that suitable packaging and sizes of containers be used to avoid creating obsolete stocks.\n(15)\nArticles containing chemicals do not fall within the scope of the Convention. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate that articles, as defined in this Regulation, containing chemicals that could be released under certain conditions of use or disposal and that are banned or severely restricted in the Union within one or more of the use categories laid down in the Convention or are subject to the PIC procedure should also be subject to the export notification rules. Furthermore, certain chemicals and articles containing specific chemicals falling outside the scope of the Convention but giving rise to particular concern should not be exported at all.\n(16)\nIn accordance with the Convention, information on transit movements of chemicals subject to the PIC procedure should be provided to Parties to the Convention who request such information.\n(17)\nUnion rules on packaging and labelling and other safety information should apply to all chemicals when intended for export to Parties and other countries unless those provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those countries, taking into account relevant international standards. Since Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 established new provisions on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, a reference to that Regulation should be included in this Regulation.\n(18)\nIn order to ensure effective control and enforcement, Member States should designate authorities such as customs authorities that should have the responsibility of controlling imports and exports of chemicals covered by this Regulation. The Commission, supported by the Agency, and the Member States have a key role to play and should act in a targeted and coordinated way. Member States should provide for appropriate penalties in the event of infringements.\n(19)\nIn order to facilitate customs control and to reduce the administrative burden for both exporters and authorities, a system of codes to be used in export declarations should be established. Special codes should also be used, as appropriate, for chemicals exported for the purpose of research or analysis in quantities that are unlikely to affect human health or the environment and that in any event do not exceed 10 kg from each exporter to each importing country per calendar year.\n(20)\nExchange of information, shared responsibility and cooperative efforts between the Union and the Member States and third countries should be promoted with a view to ensuring sound management of chemicals, whether or not those third countries are Parties to the Convention. In particular, technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition should be provided directly by the Commission and the Member States, or indirectly via support for projects by non-governmental organisations, especially assistance seeking to enable those countries to implement the Convention, thereby contributing to the prevention of harmful effects of chemicals on human health and the environment.\n(21)\nThere should be regular monitoring of the operation of the procedures if they are to be effective. To this end, Member States and the Agency should regularly submit reports in standardised form to the Commission, which should in turn regularly report to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(22)\nTechnical notes for guidance should be drawn up by the Agency to assist the designated authorities, including such authorities as customs authorities controlling exports, exporters and importers, in the application of this Regulation.\n(23)\nIn order to adapt this Regulation to technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of inclusion of chemicals in Part 1 or 2 of Annex I and other amendments to that Annex, inclusion of chemicals in Part 1 or 2 of Annex V and other amendments to that Annex, and amendments to Annexes II, III, IV and VI. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(24)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (8).\n(25)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure coherent and effective implementation of the Union’s obligations under the Convention, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the necessity to harmonise the rules concerning imports and exports of hazardous chemicals, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(26)\nRegulation (EC) No 689/2008 should be repealed.\n(27)\nIt is appropriate to provide for the deferred application of this Regulation so as to allow the Agency sufficient time to prepare for its new role and allowing industry to familiarise itself with the new procedures,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObjectives\n1.   The objectives of this Regulation are to:\n(a)\nimplement the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (the ‘Convention’);\n(b)\npromote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international movement of hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm;\n(c)\ncontribute to the environmentally sound use of hazardous chemicals.\nThe objectives set out in the first subparagraph shall be achieved by facilitating the exchange of information concerning the characteristics of hazardous chemicals, by providing for a decision-making process within the Union on their import and export and by disseminating decisions to Parties and other countries as appropriate.\n2.   In addition to the objectives set out in paragraph 1, this Regulation shall ensure that the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 relating to classification, labelling and packaging apply to all chemicals when they are exported from the Member States to other Parties or other countries, unless those provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those Parties or other countries.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

The Secretariat of the Agency shall carry out the tasks allocated to the Agency under this Regulation.\nArticle 7\nChemicals subject to export notification, chemicals qualifying for PIC notification, and chemicals subject to the PIC procedure\n1.   The chemicals subject to export notification, the chemicals qualifying for PIC notification and the chemicals subject to the PIC procedure shall be as listed in Annex I.\n2.   Chemicals listed in Annex I shall be assigned to one or more of three groups of chemicals, set out as Parts 1, 2 and 3 of that Annex.\nThe chemicals listed in Part 1 of Annex I shall be subject to the export notification procedure laid down in Article 8, with detailed information being given on the identity of the substance, on the use category and/or subcategory subject to restriction, the type of restriction and, where appropriate, additional information, in particular on exemptions to requirements for export notification.\nThe chemicals listed in Part 2 of Annex I shall, in addition to being subject to the export notification procedure laid down in Article 8, qualify for the PIC notification procedure set out in Article 11, with detailed information being given on the identity of the substance and on the use category.\nThe chemicals listed in Part 3 of Annex I shall be subject to the PIC procedure with the use category being given and, where appropriate, additional information, in particular on any requirements for export notification.\n3.   The lists set out in Annex I shall be made publicly available by means of the Database.\nArticle 8\nExport notifications forwarded to Parties and other countries\n1.   In the case of substances listed in Part 1 of Annex I or mixtures containing such substances in a concentration that triggers labelling obligations under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 irrespective of the presence of any other substances, paragraphs 2 to 8 of this Article shall apply regardless of the intended use of the chemical in the importing Party or other country.\n2.   When an exporter is due to export a chemical referred to in paragraph 1 from the Union to a Party or other country for the first time on or after the date on which it becomes subject to this Regulation, the exporter shall notify the designated national authority of the Member State in which he is established (the ‘exporter’s Member State’), no later than 35 days before the expected date of export. Thereafter the exporter shall notify that designated national authority of the first export of the chemical each calendar year no later than 35 days before the export takes place. The notifications shall comply with the information requirements laid down in Annex II and shall be made available to the Commission and to the Member States by means of the Database.\nThe designated national authority of the exporter’s Member State shall check compliance of the information with Annex II and if the notification is complete forward it to the Agency no later than 25 days before the expected date of export.\nThe Agency shall, on behalf of the Commission, transmit the notification to the designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country and take the measures necessary to ensure that they receive that notification no later than 15 days before the first intended export of the chemical and thereafter no later than 15 days before the first export in any subsequent calendar year.\nThe Agency shall register each export notification and assign it a reference identification number in the Database. The Agency shall also make available to the public and the designated national authorities of the Member States, as appropriate, an updated list of the chemicals concerned and the importing Parties and other countries for each calendar year by means of the Database.\n3.   If the Agency does not receive from the importing Party or other country an acknowledgement of receipt of the first export notification made after the chemical is included in Part 1 of Annex I within 30 days of the dispatch of such notification, it shall, on behalf of the Commission, submit a second notification. The Agency shall, on behalf of the Commission, make reasonable efforts to ensure that the designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country receives the second notification.\n4.   A new export notification shall be made in accordance with paragraph 2 for exports which take place subsequent to the entry into force of amendments to Union legislation concerning the marketing, use or labelling of the substances in question or whenever the composition of the mixture in question changes so that the labelling of such mixture is altered. The new notification shall comply with the information requirements laid down in Annex II and shall indicate that it is a revision of a previous notification.\n5.   Where the export of a chemical relates to an emergency situation in which any delay may endanger public health or the environment in the importing Party or other country, an exemption from the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 in whole or in part may be granted at the reasoned request of the exporter or the importing Party or other country and at the discretion of the designated national authority of the exporter’s Member State, in consultation with the Commission assisted by the Agency. A decision on the request shall be considered to have been made in consultation with the Commission if there is no dissenting response from the Commission within 10 days of the designated national authority of the Member State sending it details of the request.\n6.   Without prejudice to the obligations set out in Article 19(2), the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall cease when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe chemical has become a chemical subject to the PIC procedure;\n(b)\nthe importing country is a Party to the Convention and has provided the Secretariat with a response in accordance with Article 10(2) of the Convention indicating whether or not it consents to import of the chemical; and\n(c)\nthe Commission has been informed of that response by the Secretariat and has forwarded that information to the Member States and the Agency.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall not cease where an importing country is a Party to the Convention and explicitly requires continued export notification by exporting Parties, for example through its import decision or otherwise.\nWithout prejudice to the obligations set out in Article 19(2), the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall also cease when both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country has waived the requirement to be notified before the export of the chemical; and\n(b)\nthe Commission has received the information from the Secretariat or from the designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country and has forwarded it to the Member States and the Agency, which has made it available by means of the Database.\n7.   The Commission, the relevant designated national authorities of the Member States, the Agency and the exporters shall, on request, provide importing Parties and other countries with available additional information concerning the exported chemicals.\n8.   Member States may establish, in a transparent manner, systems obliging exporters to pay an administrative fee for each export notification made and for each request for explicit consent made, corresponding to the costs they incur in carrying out the procedures set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of this Article and in Article 14(6) and (7).\nArticle 9\nExport notifications received from Parties and other countries\n1.   Export notifications received by the Agency from the designated national authorities of Parties or the appropriate authorities of other countries concerning the export to the Union of a chemical the manufacture, use, handling, consumption, transport or sale of which is subject to prohibition or severe restriction under that Party’s or other country’s legislation shall be made available by means of the Database within 15 days of the Agency’s receipt of such notification.\nThe Agency shall, on behalf of the Commission, acknowledge receipt of the first export notification received for each chemical from each Party or other country.\nThe designated national authority of the Member State receiving that import shall receive a copy of any notification received by the Agency, within 10 days of its receipt, together with all available information.

"Hazardous chemicals — rules on export and import\nHazardous chemicals — rules on export and import\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 649/2012 — export and import of hazardous chemicals\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt implements in the European Union (EU) the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade.\nIt ensures that countries receiving certain chemicals from the EU are: informed about the export;asked whether they agree to the export;informed about the safe handling of chemicals to protect human health and the environment from potential harm.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe regulation applies to: hazardous chemicals listed under the Rotterdam Convention;chemicals that are banned or severely restricted within the EU;chemicals that are exported.\nIt does not cover: narcotics;radioactive materials;waste;chemical weapons;food and food additives;feed;genetically modified organisms and some medicines;chemicals exported for research or analysis in quantities unlikely to affect human health or the environment.\nThe regulation requires proper labelling and packaging of chemicals when they are exported from an EU Member State.\n242 chemicals (pesticides and industrial chemicals) are listed in Annex I and are subject to certain obligations when exported. Hazardous chemicals can either be exported on their own or blended into a mixture or article.\nThis regulation recasts and replaces Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 and updates some procedures and terminology that needed to be brought into line with other EU rules. In addition, it involves the European Chemicals Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (see summary) in implementing the legal requirements.\nHow it works\nThe regulation implements the two main procedures of the convention, i.e. the prior informed consent procedure and information exchange. It includes export notification in order to inform countries on the trade in certain chemicals, but it also goes further than the convention, for example by applying the export procedures to all countries, irrespective of whether they are parties to the convention.\nThe prior informed consent procedure allows importing parties to the convention to inform exporting parties on whether they agree to imports of the hazardous chemicals listed in the convention. The regulation requires the explicit consent of the importing country for more chemicals than those listed in the convention.\nEach chemical listed in the convention has a decision guidance document to help governments make a more informed decision. All parties are required to take a decision on allowing imports — known as an import response — and the regulation ensures that import responses are respected for EU exports.\nUnder the information exchange mechanism, each party must notify the convention’s Secretariat when banning a chemical, and must notify the importing parties when it is exported. The regulation establishes the export notification procedure for EU exports of such chemicals to all importing countries.\nAll chemicals intended for export must be labelled and packed according to certain standards and accompanied by basic safety information on a safety data sheet.\nEach EU Member State must set up a designated national authority to be responsible for implementing the regulation.\nThe European Commission and Member States share responsibility within the convention, in particular with regard to: technical assistance;information sharing;matters relating to dispute settlement.\nImplementation of Regulation (EU) No 649/2012\nIn 2018, the Commission published a report and a staff working document on the operation of Regulation (EU) No 649/2012. The report concluded that the procedures established by the regulation had worked well and contributed to achieving its objectives.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 March 2014. Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 revised and replaced Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 and its subsequent amendments.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nRegulation on export and import (European Commission)\nUnderstanding prior informed consent (European Chemicals Agency).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 649/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals (recast) (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, pp. 60–106).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 have been incorporated into the original text.
