Internal borders may be crossed at any point without any checks on persons being carried out.2. However, where public policy or national security so require a Contracting Party may, after consulting the other Contracting Parties, decide that for a limited period national border checks appropriate to the situation shall be carried out at internal borders. If public policy or national security require immediate action, the Contracting Party concerned shall take the necessary measures and at the earliest opportunity shall inform the other Contracting Parties thereof.3. The abolition of checks on persons at internal borders shall not affect the provisions laid down in Article 22, or the exercise of police powers throughout a Contracting Party's territory by the competent authorities under that Party's law, or the requirement to hold, carry and produce permits and documents provided for in that Party's law.4. Checks on goods shall be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Convention.CHAPTER 2CROSSING EXTERNAL BORDERSArticle 31. External borders may in principle only be crossed at border crossing points and during the fixed opening hours. More detailed provisions, exceptions and arrangements for local border traffic, and rules governing special categories of maritime traffic such as pleasure boating and coastal fishing, shall be adopted by the Executive Committee.2. The Contracting Parties undertake to introduce penalties for the unauthorised crossing of external borders at places other than crossing points or at times other than the fixed opening hours.Article 41. The Contracting Parties shall ensure that, as from 1993, passengers on flights from third States who transfer onto internal flights will be subject to an entry check, together with their hand baggage, at the airport at which the external flight arrives. Passengers on internal flights who transfer onto flights bound for third States will be subject to a departure check, together with their hand baggage, at the airport from which the external flight departs.2. The Contracting Parties shall take the necessary measures to ensure that checks are carried out in accordance with paragraph 1.3. Neither paragraph 1 nor paragraph 2 shall affect checks on registered baggage; such checks shall be carried out either in the airport of final destination or in the airport of initial departure.4. Until the date laid down in paragraph 1, airports shall, by way of derogation from the definition of internal borders, be considered as external borders for internal flights.Article 51. For stays not exceeding three months, aliens fulfilling the following conditions may be granted entry into the territories of the Contracting Parties:(a) that the aliens possess a valid document or documents, as defined by the Executive Committee, authorising them to cross the border;(b) that the aliens are in possession of a valid visa if required;(c) that the aliens produce, if necessary, documents justifying the purpose and conditions of the intended stay and that they have sufficient means of subsistence, both for the period of the intended stay and for the return to their country of origin or transit to a third State into which they are certain to be admitted, or are in a position to acquire such means lawfully;(d) that the aliens shall not be persons for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing entry;(e) that the aliens shall not be considered to be a threat to public policy, national security or the international relations of any of the Contracting Parties.2. An alien who does not fulfil all the above conditions must be refused entry into the territories of the Contracting Parties unless a Contracting Party considers it necessary to derogate from that principle on humanitarian grounds, on grounds of national interest or because of international obligations. In such cases authorisation to enter will be restricted to the territory of the Contracting Party concerned, which must inform the other Contracting Parties accordingly.These rules shall not preclude the application of special provisions concerning the right of asylum or of the provisions laid down in Article 18.3. Aliens who hold residence permits or re-entry visas issued by one of the Contracting Parties or, where required, both documents, shall be authorised entry for transit purposes, unless their names are on the national list of alerts of the Contracting Party whose external borders they are seeking to cross.Article 61. Cross-border movement at external borders shall be subject to checks by the competent authorities. Checks shall be carried out for the Contracting Parties' territories, in accordance with uniform principles, within the scope of national powers and national law and taking account of the interests of all Contracting Parties.2. The uniform principles referred to in paragraph 1 shall be as follows:(a) Checks on persons shall include not only the verification of travel documents and the other conditions governing entry, residence, work and exit but also checks to detect and prevent threats to the national security and public policy of the Contracting Parties. Such checks shall also be carried out on vehicles and objects in the possession of persons crossing the border. They shall be carried out by each Contracting Party in accordance with its national law, in particular where searches are involved.(b) All persons shall undergo at least one such check in order to establish their identities on the basis of the production or presentation of their travel documents.(c) On entry, aliens shall be subject to a thorough check, as defined in (a).(d) On exit, the checks shall be carried out as required in the interest of all Contracting Parties under the law on aliens in order to detect and prevent threats to the national security and public policy of the Contracting Parties. Such checks shall always be carried out on aliens.(e) If in certain circumstances such checks cannot be carried out, priorities must be set. In that case, entry checks shall as a rule take priority over exit checks.3. The competent authorities shall use mobile units to carry out external border surveillance between crossing points; the same shall apply to border crossing points outside normal opening hours. This surveillance shall be carried out in such a way as to discourage people from circumventing the checks at crossing points. The surveillance procedures shall, where appropriate, be established by the Executive Committee.4. The Contracting Parties undertake to deploy enough suitably qualified officers to carry out checks and surveillance along external borders.5. An equal degree of control shall be exercised at external borders.Article 7The Contracting Parties shall assist each other and shall maintain constant, close cooperation with a view to the effective implementation of checks and surveillance. They shall, in particular, exchange all relevant, important information, with the exception of personal data, unless otherwise provided for in this Convention. They shall as far as possible harmonise the instructions given to the authorities responsible for checks and shall promote standard basic and further training of officers manning checkpoints. Such cooperation may take the form of an exchange of liaison officers.Article 8The Executive Committee shall take the necessary decisions on the practical procedures for carrying out border checks and surveillance.CHAPTER 3VISASSection 1Short-stay visasArticle 91. The Contracting Parties undertake to adopt a common policy on the movement of persons and, in particular, on the arrangements for visas. They shall assist each other to that end. The Contracting Parties undertake to pursue through common consent the harmonisation of their policies on visas.2. The visa arrangements relating to third States whose nationals are subject to visa arrangements common to all the Contracting Parties at the time of signing this Convention or at a later date may be amended only by common consent of all the Contracting Parties. A Contracting Party may in exceptional cases derogate from the common visa arrangements relating to a third State where overriding reasons of national policy require an urgent decision. It shall first consult the other Contracting Parties and, in its decision, take account of their interests and the consequences of that decision.Article 101. A uniform visa valid for the entire territory of the Contracting Parties shall be introduced. This visa, the period of validity of which shall be determined by Article 11, may be issued for visits not exceeding three months.2. Pending the introduction of such a visa, the Contracting Parties shall recognise their respective national visas, provided that these are issued in accordance with common conditions and criteria determined in the context of the relevant provisions of this Chapter.3. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, each Contracting Party shall reserve the right to restrict the territorial validity of the visa in accordance with common arrangements determined in the context of the relevant provisions of this chapter.Article 111. The visa provided for in Article 10 may be:(a) a travel visa valid for one or more entries, provided that neither the length of a continuous visit nor the total length of successive visits exceeds three months in any half-year, from the date of first entry;(b) a transit visa authorising its holder to pass through the territories of the Contracting Parties once, twice or exceptionally several times en route to the territory of a third State, provided that no transit shall exceed five days.2. Paragraph 1 shall not preclude a Contracting Party from issuing a new visa, the validity of which is limited to its own territory, within the half-year in question if necessary.Article 121. The uniform visa provided for in Article 10(1) shall be issued by the diplomatic and consular authorities of the Contracting Parties and, where appropriate, by the authorities of the Contracting Parties designated under Article 17.2. The Contracting Party responsible for issuing such a visa shall in principle be that of the main destination. If this cannot be determined, the visa shall in principle be issued by the diplomatic or consular post of the Contracting Party of first entry.3. The Executive Committee shall specify the implementing arrangements and, in particular, the criteria for determining the main destination.Article 131. No visa shall be affixed to a travel document that has expired.2. The period of validity of a travel document must exceed that of the visa, taking account of the period of use of the visa. It must enable aliens to return to their country of origin or to enter a third country.Article 141. No visa shall be affixed to a travel document if that travel document is not valid for any of the Contracting Parties. If a travel document is only valid for one Contracting Party or for a number of Contracting Parties, the visa to be affixed shall be limited to the Contracting Party or Parties in question.2. If a travel document is not recognised as valid by one or more of the Contracting Parties, an authorisation valid as a visa may be issued in place of a visa.Article 15In principle the visas referred to in Article 10 may be issued only if an alien fulfils the entry conditions laid down in Article 5(1)(a), (c), (d) and (e).Article 16If a Contracting Party considers it necessary to derogate on one of the grounds listed in Article 5(2) from the principle laid down in Article 15, by issuing a visa to an alien who does not fulfil all the entry conditions referred to in Article 5(1), the validity of this visa shall be restricted to the territory of that Contracting Party, which must inform the other Contracting Parties accordingly.Article 171. The Executive Committee shall adopt common rules for the examination of visa applications, shall ensure their correct implementation and shall adapt them to new situations and circumstances.2. The Executive Committee shall also specify the cases in which the issue of a visa shall be subject to consultation with the central authority of the Contracting Party with which the application is lodged and, where appropriate, the central authorities of other Contracting Parties.3. The Executive Committee shall also take the necessary decisions on the following:(a) the travel documents to which a visa may be affixed;(b) the visa-issuing authorities;(c) the conditions governing the issue of visas at borders;(d) the form, content, and period of validity of visas and the fees to be charged for their issue;(e) the conditions for the extension and refusal of the visas referred to in (c) and (d), in accordance with the interests of all the Contracting Parties;(f) the procedures for limiting the territorial validity of visas;(g) the principles governing the drawing up of a common list of aliens for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing entry, without prejudice to Article 96.Section 2Long-stay visasArticle 18Visas for stays exceeding three months shall be national visas issued by one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its national law. Such visas shall enable their holders to transit through the territories of the other Contracting Parties in order to reach the territory of the Contracting Party which issued the visa, unless they fail to fulfil the entry conditions referred to in Article 5(1)(a), (d) and (e) or they are on the national list of alerts of the Contracting Party through the territory of which they seek to transit.CHAPTER 4CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE MOVEMENT OF ALIENSArticle 191. Aliens who hold uniform visas and who have legally entered the territory of a Contracting Party may move freely within the territories of all the Contracting Parties during the period of validity of their visas, provided that they fulfil the entry conditions referred to in Article 5(1)(a), (c), (d) and (e).2. Pending the introduction of a uniform visa, aliens who hold visas issued by one of the Contracting Parties and who have legally entered the territory of one Contracting Party may move freely within the territories of all the Contracting Parties during the period of validity of their visas up to a maximum of three months from the date of first entry, provided that they fulfil the entry conditions referred to in Article 5(1)(a), (c), (d) and (e).3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to visas whose validity is subject to territorial limitation in accordance with Chapter 3 of this Title.4. This Article shall apply without prejudice to Article 22.Article 201. Aliens not subject to a visa requirement may move freely within the territories of the Contracting Parties for a maximum period of three months during the six months following the date of first entry, provided that they fulfil the entry conditions referred to in Article 5(1)(a), (c), (d) and (e).2. Paragraph 1 shall not affect each Contracting Party's right to extend beyond three months an alien's stay in its territory in exceptional circumstances or in accordance with a bilateral agreement concluded before the entry into force of this Convention.3. This Article shall apply without prejudice to Article 22.Article 211. Aliens who hold valid residence permits issued by one of the Contracting Parties may, on the basis of that permit and a valid travel document, move freely for up to three months within the territories of the other Contracting Parties, provided that they fulfil the entry conditions referred to in Article 5(1)(a), (c) and (e) and are not on the national list of alerts of the Contracting Party concerned.2. Paragraph 1 shall also apply to aliens who hold provisional residence permits issued by one of the Contracting Parties and travel documents issued by that Contracting Party.3. The Contracting Parties shall send the Executive Committee a list of the documents that they issue as valid travel documents, residence permits or provisional residence permits within the meaning of this Article.4. This Article shall apply without prejudice to Article 22.Article 221. Aliens who have legally entered the territory of one of the Contracting Parties shall be obliged to report, in accordance with the conditions laid down by each Contracting Party, to the competent authorities of the Contracting Party whose territory they enter. Such aliens may report either on entry or within three working days of entry, at the discretion of the Contracting Party whose territory they enter.2. Aliens resident in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties who enter the territory of another Contracting Party shall be required to report to the authorities, as laid down in paragraph 1.3. Each Contracting Party shall lay down its exemptions from paragraphs 1 and 2 and shall communicate them to the Executive Committee.Article 231. Aliens who do not fulfil or who no longer fulfil the short-stay conditions applicable within the territory of a Contracting Party shall normally be required to leave the territories of the Contracting Parties immediately.2. Aliens who hold valid residence permits or provisional residence permits issued by another Contracting Party shall be required to go to the territory of that Contracting Party immediately.3. Where such aliens have not left voluntarily or where it may be assumed that they will not do so or where their immediate departure is required for reasons of national security or public policy, they must be expelled from the territory of the Contracting Party in which they were apprehended, in accordance with the national law of that Contracting Party. If under that law expulsion is not authorised, the Contracting Party concerned may allow the persons concerned to remain within its territory.4. Such aliens may be expelled from the territory of that Party to their countries of origin or any other State to which they may be admitted, in particular under the relevant provisions of the readmission agreements concluded by the Contracting Parties.5. Paragraph 4 shall not preclude the application of national provisions on the right of asylum, the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, paragraph 2 of this Article or Article 33(1) of this Convention.Article 24Subject to the Executive Committee's definition of the appropriate criteria and practical arrangements, the Contracting Parties shall compensate each other for any financial imbalances which may result from the obligation to expel as provided for in Article 23 where such expulsion cannot be effected at the alien's expense.CHAPTER 5RESIDENCE PERMITS AND ALERTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF REFUSING ENTRYArticle 251. Where a Contracting Party considers issuing a residence permit to an alien for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing entry, it shall first consult the Contracting Party issuing the alert and shall take account of its interests; the residence permit shall be issued for substantive reasons only, notably on humanitarian grounds or by reason of international commitments.If a residence permit is issued, the Contracting Party issuing the alert shall withdraw the alert but may put the alien concerned on its national list of alerts.2. Where it emerges that an alert for the purposes of refusing entry has been issued for an alien who holds a valid residence permit issued by one of the Contracting Parties, the Contracting Party issuing the alert shall consult the Party which issued the residence permit in order to determine whether there are sufficient reasons for withdrawing the residence permit.If the residence permit is not withdrawn, the Contracting Party issuing the alert shall withdraw the alert but may nevertheless put the alien in question on its national list of alerts.CHAPTER 6ACCOMPANYING MEASURESArticle 261. The Contracting Parties undertake, subject to the obligations resulting from their accession to the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, to incorporate the following rules into their national law:(a) If aliens are refused entry into the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, the carrier which brought them to the external border by air, sea or land shall be obliged immediately to assume responsibility for them again. At the request of the border surveillance authorities the carrier shall be obliged to return the aliens to the third State from which they were transported or to the third State which issued the travel document on which they travelled or to any other third State to which they are certain to be admitted.(b) The carrier shall be obliged to take all the necessary measures to ensure that an alien carried by air or sea is in possession of the travel documents required for entry into the territories of the Contracting Parties.2. The Contracting Parties undertake, subject to the obligations resulting from their accession to the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, and in accordance with their constitutional law, to impose penalties on carriers which transport aliens who do not possess the necessary travel documents by air or sea from a Third State to their territories.3. Paragraphs 1(b) and 2 shall also apply to international carriers transporting groups overland by coach, with the exception of border traffic.Article 271. The Contracting Parties undertake to impose appropriate penalties on any person who, for financial gain, assists or tries to assist an alien to enter or reside within the territory of one of the Contracting Parties in breach of that Contracting Party's laws on the entry and residence of aliens.2. If a Contracting Party is informed of actions as referred to in paragraph 1 which are in breach of the law of another Contracting Party, it shall inform the latter accordingly.3. Any Contracting Party which requests another Contracting Party to prosecute, on the grounds of a breach of its own laws, actions as referred to in paragraph 1 must specify, by means of an official report or a certificate from the competent authorities, the provisions of law that have been breached.CHAPTER 7RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROCESSING APPLICATIONS FOR ASYLUMArticle 28The Contracting Parties reaffirm their obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, with no geographic restriction on the scope of those instruments, and their commitment to cooperating with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the implementation of those instruments.Article 291. The Contracting Parties undertake to process any application for asylum lodged by an alien within any one of their territories.2. This obligation shall not bind a Contracting Party to authorising all asylum seekers to enter or remain within its territory.Every Contracting Party shall retain the right to refuse entry or to expel asylum seekers to a third State on the basis of its national provisions and in accordance with its international commitments.3. Regardless of the Contracting Party with which an alien lodges an application for asylum, only one Contracting Party shall be responsible for processing that application. This shall be determined on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 30.4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, every Contracting Party shall retain the right, for special reasons connected in particular with national law, to process an application for asylum even if, under this Convention, the responsibility for so doing lies with another Contracting Party.Article 301. The Contracting Party responsible for processing an application for asylum shall be determined as follows:(a) If a Contracting Party has issued an asylum seeker with a visa, of whatever type, or a residence permit, it shall be responsible for processing the application. If the visa was issued on the authorisation of another Contracting Party, the Contracting Party which gave the authorisation shall be responsible.(b) If two or more Contracting Parties have issued an asylum seeker with a visa, of whatever type, or a residence permit, the Contracting Party responsible shall be the one which issued the visa or the residence permit that will expire last.(c) As long as the asylum seeker has not left the territories of the Contracting Parties, the responsibility defined in (a) and (b) shall remain even if the period of validity of the visa, of whatever type, or of the residence permit has expired. If the asylum seeker has left the territories of the Contracting Parties after the visa or the residence permit has been issued, these documents shall be the basis for the responsibility as defined in (a) and (b), unless they have expired in the meantime under national provisions.(d) If the Contracting Parties exempt the asylum seeker from the visa requirement, the Contracting Party across whose external borders the asylum seeker entered the territories of the Contracting Parties shall be responsible.Until the harmonisation of visa policies is fully achieved, and if the asylum seeker is exempted from the visa requirement by some Contracting Parties only, the Contracting Party across whose external borders the asylum seeker, through exemption from the visa requirement, has entered the territories of the Contracting Parties shall be responsible, subject to (a), (b) and (c).If the application for asylum is lodged with a Contracting Party which has issued a transit visa to the asylum seeker - whether the asylum seeker has passed through passport control or not - and if the transit visa was issued after the country of transit had ascertained from the consular or diplomatic authorities of the Contracting Party of destination that the asylum seeker fulfilled the entry conditions for the Contracting Party of destination, the Contracting Party of destination shall be responsible for processing the application.(e) If the asylum seeker has entered the territory of the Contracting Parties without being in possession of one or more documents, to be defined by the Executive Committee, authorising the crossing of the border, the Contracting Party across whose external borders the asylum seeker entered the territories of the Contracting Parties shall be responsible.(f) If an alien whose application for asylum is already being processed by one of the Contracting Parties lodges a new application, the Contracting Party responsible shall be the one processing the first application.(g) If an alien on whose previous application for asylum a Contracting Party has already taken a final decision lodges a new application, the Contracting Party responsible shall be the one that processed the previous application unless the asylum seeker has left the territory of the Contracting Parties.2. If a Contracting Party has undertaken to process an application for asylum in accordance with Article 29(4), the Contracting Party responsible under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be relieved of its obligations.3. Where no Contracting Party responsible can be determined on the basis of the criteria laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Contracting Party with which the application for asylum was lodged shall be responsible.Article 311. The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to determine as quickly as possible which Party is responsible for processing an application for asylum.2. If an application for asylum is lodged with a Contracting Party which is not responsible under Article 30 by an alien residing within its territory, that Contracting Party may request the Contracting Party responsible to take charge of the asylum seeker in order to process the application for asylum.3. The Contracting Party responsible shall be obliged to take charge of the asylum seeker referred to in paragraph 2 if the request is made within six months of the application for asylum being lodged. If the request is not made within that time, the Contracting Party with whom the application for asylum was lodged shall be responsible for processing the application.Article 32The Contracting Party responsible for processing an application for asylum shall process it in accordance with its national law.Article 331. If an asylum seeker is illegally within the territory of another Contracting Party while the asylum procedure is in progress, the Contracting Party responsible shall be obliged to take the asylum seeker back.2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where the other Contracting Party has issued an asylum seeker with a residence permit valid for one year or more. In that case, responsibility for processing the application shall be transferred to the other Contracting Party.Article 341. The Contracting Party responsible shall be obliged to take back an alien whose application for asylum has been definitively rejected and who has entered the territory of another Contracting Party without being authorised to reside there.2. Paragraph 1 shall not, however, apply where the Contracting Party responsible expelled the alien from the territories of the Contracting Parties.Article 351. The Contracting Party which granted an alien the status of refugee and right of residence shall be obliged to take responsibility for processing any application for asylum made by a member of the alien's family provided that the persons concerned agree.2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a family member shall be the refugee's spouse or unmarried child who is less than 18 years old or, if the refugee is an unmarried child who is less than 18 years old, the refugee's father or mother.Article 36Any Contracting Party responsible for processing an application for asylum may, for humanitarian reasons, based in particular family or cultural grounds, ask another Contracting Party to assume that responsibility provided that the asylum seeker so desires. The Contracting Party to which such a request is made shall consider whether it can be granted.Article 371. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall at the earliest opportunity send each other details of:(a) any new rules or measures adopted in the field of asylum law or the treatment of asylum seekers no later than their entry into force;(b) statistical data on the monthly arrivals of asylum seekers, indicating the main countries of origin and decisions on applications for asylum where available;(c) the emergence of, or significant increases in, certain categories of asylum seekers and any information available on this subject;(d) any fundamental decisions in the field of asylum law.2. The Contracting Parties shall also ensure close cooperation in gathering information on the situation in the asylum seekers' countries of origin with a view to a joint assessment.3. Any instruction given by a Contracting Party concerning the confidential processing of the information that it communicates must be complied with by the other Contracting Parties.Article 381. Every Contracting Party shall send every other Contracting Party at their request any information it has on an asylum seeker which is necessary for the purposes of:- determining the Contracting Party responsible for processing the application for asylum,- processing the application for asylum,- implementing the obligations arising under this chapter.2. Such information may concern only:(a) identity (surname and forename, any previous names, nicknames or aliases, date and place of birth, present nationality and any previous nationalities of the asylum seeker and, where appropriate, of the asylum seeker's family members);(b) identity and travel documents (references, periods of validity, dates of issue, issuing authorities, place of issue, etc.);(c) any other details needed to establish the asylum seeker's identity;(d) places of residence and routes travelled;(e) residence permits or visas issued by a Contracting Party;(f) the place where the application for asylum was lodged;(g) where appropriate, the date any previous application for asylum was lodged, the date on which the present application was lodged, the stage reached in the procedure and the decision taken.3. In addition, a Contracting Party may ask another Contracting Party to inform it of the grounds invoked by an asylum seeker in support of an application and, where appropriate, the grounds for the decision taken on the asylum seeker. The Contracting Party requested shall consider whether it can comply with such a request. In all events the communication of such information shall be subject to the asylum seeker's consent.4. Information shall be exchanged at the request of a Contracting Party and may only be exchanged between the authorities designated by each Contracting Party, once the Executive Committee has been informed thereof.5. The information exchanged may only be used for the purposes laid down in paragraph 1. Such information may only be communicated to the authorities and courts and tribunals responsible for:- determining the Contracting Party responsible for processing the application for asylum,- processing the application for asylum,- implementing obligations arising under this chapter.6. The Contracting Party that forwards the information shall ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.If it appears that a Contracting Party has supplied information that is inaccurate or should not have been forwarded, the recipient Contracting Parties shall be informed immediately thereof. They shall be obliged to correct such information or delete it.7. Asylum seekers shall have the right to receive on request the information exchanged which concerns them as long as it remains available.If they establish that such information is inaccurate or should not have been forwarded, they shall have the right to demand its correction or deletion. Corrections shall be made in accordance with paragraph 6.8. Each Contracting Party concerned shall record the forwarding and receipt of information exchanged.9. Information forwarded shall be held no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was exchanged. The Contracting Party concerned shall assess in due course whether it is necessary for it to be held.10. In any case, information thus forwarded shall enjoy at least the same protection as is provided for similar information in the law of the recipient Contracting Party.11. If information is not processed automatically but is handled in some other form, each Contracting Party shall take the appropriate measures to ensure compliance with this Article by means of effective controls. If a Contracting Party has a body of the type referred to in paragraph 12, it may assign the control task to it.12. If one or more Contracting Parties wishes to computerise all or part of the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, such computerisation shall only be authorised if the Contracting Parties concerned have adopted laws applicable to such processing which implement the principles of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data of 28 January 1981 and if they have entrusted an appropriate national body with the independent monitoring of the processing and use of data forwarded pursuant to this Convention.TITLE IIIPOLICE AND SECURITYCHAPTER 1POLICE COOPERATIONArticle 391. The Contracting Parties undertake to ensure that their police authorities shall, in compliance with national law and within the scope of their powers, assist each other for the purposes of preventing and detecting criminal offences, in so far as national law does not stipulate that the request has to be made and channelled via the judicial authorities and provided that the request or the implementation thereof does not involve the application of measures of constraint by the requested Contracting Party. Where the requested police authorities do not have the power to deal with a request, they shall forward it to the competent authorities.2. Written information provided by the requested Contracting Party under paragraph 1 may not be used by the requesting Contracting Party as evidence of the offence charged other than with the consent of the competent judicial authorities of the requested Contracting Party.3.

Paragraph 1 shall not affect the application of the broader provisions of the bilateral agreements in force between the Contracting Parties.Article 49Mutual assistance shall also be afforded:(a) in proceedings brought by the administrative authorities in respect of acts which are punishable under the national law of one of the two Contracting Parties, or of both, by virtue of being infringements of the rules of law, and where the decision may give rise to proceedings before a court having jurisdiction in particular in criminal matters;(b) in proceedings for claims for damages arising from wrongful prosecution or conviction;(c) in clemency proceedings;(d) in civil actions joined to criminal proceedings, as long as the criminal court has not yet taken a final decision in the criminal proceedings;(e) in the service of judicial documents relating to the enforcement of a sentence or a preventive measure, the imposition of a fine or the payment of costs for proceedings;(f) in respect of measures relating to the deferral of delivery or suspension of enforcement of a sentence or a preventive measure, to conditional release or to a stay or interruption of enforcement of a sentence or a preventive measure.Article 501. The Contracting Parties undertake to afford each other, in accordance with the Convention and the Treaty referred to in Article 48, mutual assistance as regards infringements of their laws and regulations on excise duties, value added tax and customs duties. Customs provisions shall mean the rules laid down in Article 2 of the Convention of 7 September 1967 between Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on Mutual Assistance between Customs Administrations, and Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 of 19 May 1981.2.

The requesting Contracting Party shall not forward or use information or evidence obtained from the requested Contracting Party for investigations, prosecutions or proceedings other than those referred to in its request without the prior consent of the requested Contracting Party.4. The mutual assistance provided for in this Article may be refused where the alleged amount of duty underpaid or evaded does not exceed ECU 25000 or where the presumed value of the goods exported or imported without authorisation does not exceed ECU 100000, unless, given the circumstances or the identity of the accused, the case is deemed to be extremely serious by the requesting Contracting Party.5.

Each Contracting Party may send procedural documents directly by post to persons who are in the territory of another Contracting Party. The Contracting Parties shall send the Executive Committee a list of the documents which may be forwarded in this way.2. Where there is reason to believe that the addressee does not understand the language in which the document is written, the document - or at least the important passages thereof - must be translated into (one of) the language(s) of the Contracting Party in whose territory the addressee is staying. If the authority forwarding the document knows that the addressee understands only some other language, the document - or at least the important passages thereof - must be translated into that other language.3. Experts or witnesses who have failed to answer a summons to appear sent to them by post shall not, even if the summons contains a notice of penalty, be subjected to any punishment or measure of constraint, unless subsequently they voluntarily enter into the territory of the requesting Party and are there again duly summoned. Authorities sending a postal summons to appear shall ensure that this does not involve a notice of penalty. This provision shall be without prejudice to Article 34 of the Benelux Treaty concerning Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 27 June 1962, as amended by the Protocol of 11 May 1974.4. If the act on which the request for assistance is based is punishable under the law of both Contracting Parties by virtue of being an infringement of the rules of law which is being prosecuted by the administrative authorities, and where the decision may give rise to proceedings before a court having jurisdiction in particular in criminal matters, the procedure outlined in paragraph 1 must in principle be used for the forwarding of procedural documents.5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, procedural documents may be forwarded via the judicial authorities of the requested Contracting Party where the addressee's address is unknown or where the requesting Contracting Party requires a document to be served in person.Article 531. Requests for assistance may be made directly between judicial authorities and returned via the same channels.2. Paragraph 1 shall not prejudice the possibility of requests being sent and returned between Ministries of Justice or through national central bureaux of the International Criminal Police Organisation.3.

Information laid in connection with proceedings against infringement of the legislation on driving and rest periods, in accordance with Article 21 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 20 April 1959 or Article 42 of the Benelux Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 27 June 1962, as amended by the Protocol of 11 May 1974, may be sent by the judicial authorities of the requesting Contracting Party directly to the judicial authorities of the requested Contracting Party.CHAPTER 3APPLICATION OF THE NE BIS IN IDEM PRINCIPLEArticle 54A person whose trial has been finally disposed of in one Contracting Party may not be prosecuted in another Contracting Party for the same acts provided that, if a penalty has been imposed, it has been enforced, is actually in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the laws of the sentencing Contracting Party.Article 551. A Contracting Party may, when ratifying, accepting or approving this Convention, declare that it is not bound by Article 54 in one or more of the following cases:(a) where the acts to which the foreign judgment relates took place in whole or in part in its own territory; in the latter case, however, this exception shall not apply if the acts took place in part in the territory of the Contracting Party where the judgment was delivered;(b) where the acts to which the foreign judgment relates constitute an offence against national security or other equally essential interests of that Contracting Party;(c) where the acts to which the foreign judgment relates were committed by officials of that Contracting Party in violation of the duties of their office.2. A Contracting Party which has made a declaration regarding the exception referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall specify the categories of offences to which this exception may apply.3. A Contracting Party may at any time withdraw a declaration relating to one or more of the exceptions referred to in paragraph 1.4. The exceptions which were the subject of a declaration under paragraph 1 shall not apply where the Contracting Party concerned has, in connection with the same acts, requested the other Contracting Party to bring the prosecution or has granted extradition of the person concerned.Article 56If a further prosecution is brought in a Contracting Party against a person whose trial, in respect of the same acts, has been finally disposed of in another Contracting Party, any period of deprivation of liberty served in the latter Contracting Party arising from those acts shall be deducted from any penalty imposed. To the extent permitted by national law, penalties not involving deprivation of liberty shall also be taken into account.Article 571. Where a Contracting Party charges a person with an offence and the competent authorities of that Contracting Party have reason to believe that the charge relates to the same acts as those in respect of which the person's trial has been finally disposed of in another Contracting Party, those authorities shall, if they deem it necessary, request the relevant information from the competent authorities of the Contracting Party in whose territory judgment has already been delivered.2. The information requested shall be provided as soon as possible and shall be taken into consideration as regards further action to be taken in the proceedings under way.3. Each Contracting Party shall, when ratifying, accepting or approving this Convention, nominate the authorities authorised to request and receive the information provided for in this Article.Article 58The above provisions shall not preclude the application of broader national provisions on the ne bis in idem principle with regard to judicial decisions taken abroad.CHAPTER 4EXTRADITIONArticle 591.

Paragraph 1 shall not affect the application of the broader provisions of the bilateral agreements in force between the Contracting Parties.Article 60In relations between two Contracting Parties, one of which is not a Party to the European Convention on Extradition of 13 September 1957, the provisions of the said Convention shall apply, subject to the reservations and declarations made at the time of ratifying that Convention or, for Contracting Parties which are not Parties to the Convention, at the time of ratifying, approving or accepting this Convention.Article 61The French Republic undertakes to extradite, at the request of one of the Contracting Parties, persons against whom proceedings are being brought for acts punishable under French law by a penalty involving deprivation of liberty or a detention order of a maximum period of at least two years and under the law of the requesting Contracting Party by a penalty involving deprivation of liberty or a detention order of a maximum period of at least one year.Article 621. As regards interruption of limitation of actions, only the provisions of the requesting Contracting Party shall apply.2. An amnesty granted by the requested Contracting Party shall not prevent extradition unless the offence falls within the jurisdiction of that Contracting Party.3. The absence of a charge or an official notice authorising proceedings, necessary only under the law of the requested Contracting Party, shall not affect the obligation to extradite.Article 63The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the Convention and the Treaty referred to in Article 59, to extradite between themselves persons being prosecuted by the judicial authorities of the requesting Contracting Party for one of the offences referred to in Article 50(1), or sought by the requesting Contracting Party for the purposes of enforcing a sentence or preventive measure imposed in respect of such an offence.Article 64An alert entered into the Schengen Information System in accordance with Article 95 shall have the same force as a request for provisional arrest under Article 16 of the European Convention on Extradition of 13 September 1957 or Article 15 of the Benelux Treaty concerning Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 27 June 1962, as amended by the Protocol of 11 May 1974.Article 651.

The wanted person may be assisted by a lawyer during the hearing.2. In cases of extradition under paragraph 1, wanted persons who explicitly state that they will relinquish the protection offered by the principle of speciality may not revoke that statement.CHAPTER 5TRANSFER OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF CRIMINAL JUDGMENTSArticle 67The following provisions shall apply between the Contracting Parties which are Parties to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons of 21 March 1983, for the purposes of supplementing that Convention.Article 681. The Contracting Party in whose territory a penalty involving deprivation of liberty or a detention order has been imposed by a judgment which has obtained the force of res judicata in respect of a national of another Contracting Party who, by escaping to the national's own country, has avoided the enforcement of that penalty or detention order may request the latter Contracting Party, if the escaped person is within its territory, to take over the enforcement of the penalty or detention order.2. The requested Contracting Party may, at the request of the requesting Contracting Party, prior to the arrival of the documents supporting the request that the enforcement of the penalty or detention order or part thereof remaining to be served be taken over, and prior to the decision on that request, take the sentenced person into police custody or take other measures to ensure that the person remains within the territory of the requested Contracting Party.Article 69The transfer of enforcement under Article 68 shall not require the consent of the person on whom the penalty or the detention order has been imposed.

Each Contracting Party shall retain responsibility for and control over any operation carried out in its own territory and shall be entitled to intervene.Article 74As regards the legal trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, the Contracting Parties agree that the checks arising from obligations under the United Nations Conventions listed in Article 71 and which are carried out at internal borders shall, wherever possible, be transferred to within the country.Article 751. As regards the movement of travellers to the territories of the Contracting Parties or their movement within these territories, persons may carry the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances that are necessary for their medical treatment provided that, at any check, they produce a certificate issued or authenticated by a competent authority of their State of residence.2. The Executive Committee shall lay down the form and content of the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 and issued by one of the Contracting Parties, with particular reference to details on the nature and quantity of the products and substances and the duration of the journey.3. The Contracting Parties shall notify each other of the authorities responsible for the issue and authentication of the certificate referred to in paragraph 2.Article 761. The Contracting Parties shall, where necessary, and in accordance with their medical, ethical and practical usage, adopt appropriate measures for the control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which in the territory of one or more Contracting Parties are subject to more rigorous controls than in their own territory, so as not to jeopardise the effectiveness of such controls.2. Paragraph 1 shall also apply to substances frequently used in the manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.3. The Contracting Parties shall notify each other of the measures taken in order to monitor the legal trade of the substances referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.4.

The Contracting Parties undertake to impose an authorisation requirement on manufacturers of, and on dealers in, firearms subject to authorisation and to impose a declaration requirement on manufacturers of, and on dealers in, firearms subject to declaration. Authorisation for firearms subject to authorisation shall also cover firearms subject to declaration. The Contracting Parties shall carry out checks on arms manufacturers and arms dealers, thereby guaranteeing effective control.2. The Contracting Parties undertake to adopt measures to ensure that, as a minimum requirement, all firearms are permanently marked with a serial number enabling identification and that they carry the manufacturer's mark.3. The Contracting Parties shall require manufacturers and dealers to keep a register of all firearms subject to authorisation or declaration; the register shall enable rapid identification of the type and origin of the firearms and the persons acquiring them.4. As regards firearms subject to authorisation under Articles 79 and 80, the Contracting Parties undertake to adopt measures to ensure that the serial number and the manufacturer's mark on the firearm are entered in the authorisation issued to its holder.Article 861. The Contracting Parties undertake to adopt measures prohibiting legitimate holders of firearms subject to authorisation or declaration from handing such arms over to persons who do not hold either an authorisation to acquire them or a declaration certificate.2. The Contracting Parties may authorise the temporary handing over of such firearms in accordance with procedures that they shall lay down.Article 871. The Contracting Parties shall incorporate in their national law provisions enabling authorisation to be withdrawn from persons who no longer satisfy the conditions for the issue of authorisations under Article 83.2. The Contracting Parties undertake to adopt appropriate measures, including the seizure of firearms and withdrawal of authorisations, and to lay down appropriate penalties for any infringements of the laws and regulations on firearms. Such penalties may include the confiscation of firearms.Article 881. A person who holds an authorisation to acquire a firearm shall not require an authorisation to acquire ammunition for that firearm.2.

The Contracting Parties agree, on the basis of the European Convention on the Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Firearms by Individuals of 28 June 1978, to set up within the framework of their national laws an exchange of information on the acquisition of firearms by persons - whether private individuals or firearms dealers - habitually resident or established in the territory of another Contracting Party. A firearms dealer shall mean any person whose trade or business consists, in whole or in part, in the retailing of firearms.2. The exchange of information shall concern:(a) between two Contracting Parties having ratified the Convention referred to in paragraph 1: the firearms listed in Appendix 1(A)(1)(a) to (h) of the said Convention;(b) between two Contracting Parties at least one of which has not ratified the Convention referred to in paragraph 1: firearms which are subject to authorisation or declaration in each of the Contracting Parties.3.

The authority designated by each Contracting Party may forward the information it has received to the competent local police authorities and the authorities responsible for border surveillance, for the purposes of preventing or prosecuting criminal offences and infringements of rules of law.TITLE IVTHE SCHENGEN INFORMATION SYSTEMCHAPTER 1ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHENGEN INFORMATION SYSTEMArticle 921. The Contracting Parties shall set up and maintain a joint information system, hereinafter referred to as \"the Schengen Information System\", consisting of a national section in each of the Contracting Parties and a technical support function. The Schengen Information System shall enable the authorities designated by the Contracting Parties, by means of an automated search procedure, to have access to alerts on persons and property for the purposes of border checks and other police and customs checks carried out within the country in accordance with national law and, in the case of the specific category of alerts referred to in Article 96, for the purposes of issuing visas, residence permits and the administration of legislation on aliens in the context of the application of the provisions of this Convention relating to the movement of persons.2. Each Contracting Party shall set up and maintain, for its own account and at its own risk, its national section of the Schengen Information System, the data file of which shall be made materially identical to the data files of the national sections of each of the other Contracting Parties by means of the technical support function. To ensure the rapid and effective transmission of data as referred to in paragraph 3, each Contracting Party shall observe, when setting up its national section, the protocols and procedures which the Contracting Parties have jointly established for the technical support function. Each national section's data file shall be available for the purposes of carrying out automated searches in the territory of each of the Contracting Parties. It shall not be possible to search the data files of other Contracting Parties' national sections.3. The Contracting Parties shall set up and maintain, on a common cost basis and bearing joint liability, the technical support function of the Schengen Information System. The French Republic shall be responsible for the technical support function, which shall be located in Strasbourg. The technical support function shall comprise a data file which will ensure via on-line transmission that the data files of the national sections contain identical information. The data files of the technical support function shall contain alerts for persons and property in so far as these concern all the Contracting Parties. The data file of the technical support function shall contain no data other than those referred to in this paragraph and in Article 113(2).CHAPTER 2OPERATION AND USE OF THE SCHENGEN INFORMATION SYSTEMArticle 93The purpose of the Schengen Information System shall be in accordance with this Convention to maintain public policy and public security, including national security, in the territories of the Contracting Parties and to apply the provisions of this Convention relating to the movement of persons in those territories, using information communicated via this system.Article 941. The Schengen Information System shall contain only those categories of data which are supplied by each of the Contracting Parties, as required for the purposes laid down in Articles 95 to 100. The Contracting Party issuing an alert shall determine whether the case is important enough to warrant entry of the alert in the Schengen Information System.2. The categories of data shall be as follows:(a) persons for whom an alert has been issued;(b) objects referred to in Article 100 and vehicles referred to in Article 99.3. For persons, the information shall be no more than the following:(a) surname and forenames, any aliases possibly entered separately;(b) any specific objective physical characteristics not subject to change;(c) first letter of second forename;(d) date and place of birth;(e) sex;(f) nationality;(g) whether the persons concerned are armed;(h) whether the persons concerned are violent;(i) reason for the alert;(j) action to be taken.Other information, in particular the data listed in the first sentence of Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data of 28 January 1981, shall not be authorised.4. Where a Contracting Party considers that an alert in accordance with Articles 95, 97 or 99 is incompatible with its national law, its international obligations or essential national interests, it may subsequently add to the alert contained in the data file of the national section of the Schengen Information System a flag to the effect that the action to be taken on the basis of the alert will not be taken in its territory. Consultation must be held in this connection with the other Contracting Parties. If the Contracting Party issuing the alert does not withdraw the alert, it shall continue to apply in full for the other Contracting Parties.Article 951. Data on persons wanted for arrest for extradition purposes shall be entered at the request of the judicial authority of the requesting Contracting Party.2. Before issuing an alert, the Contracting Party shall check whether the arrest is authorised under the national law of the requested Contracting Parties. If the Contracting Party issuing the alert has any doubts, it must consult the other Contracting Parties concerned.The Contracting Party issuing the alert shall send the requested Contracting Parties by the quickest means possible both the alert and the following essential information relating to the case:(a) the authority which issued the request for arrest;(b) whether there is an arrest warrant or other document having the same legal effect, or an enforceable judgment;(c) the nature and legal classification of the offence;(d) a description of the circumstances in which the offence was committed, including the time, place and the degree of participation in the offence by the person for whom the alert has been issued;(e) in so far as is possible, the consequences of the offence.3. A requested Contracting Party may add to the alert in the data file of its national section of the Schengen Information System a flag prohibiting arrest on the basis of the alert until the flag is deleted. The flag must be deleted no later than 24 hours after the alert has been entered, unless the Contracting Party refuses to make the requested arrest on legal grounds or for special reasons of expediency. In particularly exceptional cases where this is justified by the complex nature of the facts behind the alert, the above time limit may be extended to one week. Without prejudice to a flag or a decision to refuse the arrest, the other Contracting Parties may make the arrest requested in the alert.4. If, for particularly urgent reasons, a Contracting Party requests an immediate search, the requested Contracting Party shall examine whether it is able to withdraw its flag. The requested Contracting Party shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the action to be taken can be carried out immediately if the alert is validated.5. If the arrest cannot be made because an investigation has not been completed or because a requested Contracting Party refuses, the latter must regard the alert as being an alert for the purposes of communicating the place of residence of the person concerned.6. The requested Contracting Parties shall carry out the action as requested in the alert in accordance with extradition Conventions in force and with national law. They shall not be obliged to carry out the action requested where one of their nationals is involved, without prejudice to the possibility of making the arrest in accordance with national law.Article 961. Data on aliens for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing entry shall be entered on the basis of a national alert resulting from decisions taken by the competent administrative authorities or courts in accordance with the rules of procedure laid down by national law.2. Decisions may be based on a threat to public policy or public security or to national security which the presence of an alien in national territory may pose.This situation may arise in particular in the case of:(a) an alien who has been convicted of an offence carrying a penalty involving deprivation of liberty of at least one year;(b) an alien in respect of whom there are serious grounds for believing that he has committed serious criminal offences, including those referred to in Article 71, or in respect of whom there is clear evidence of an intention to commit such offences in the territory of a Contracting Party.3. Decisions may also be based on the fact that the alien has been subject to measures involving deportation, refusal of entry or removal which have not been rescinded or suspended, including or accompanied by a prohibition on entry or, where applicable, a prohibition on residence, based on a failure to comply with national regulations on the entry or residence of aliens.Article 97Data on missing persons or persons who, for their own protection or in order to prevent threats, need temporarily to be placed under police protection at the request of the competent authority or the competent judicial authority of the Party issuing the alert shall be entered, so that the police authorities may communicate their whereabouts to the Party issuing the alert or may move the persons to a safe place in order to prevent them from continuing their journey, if so authorised by national law. This shall apply in particular to minors and persons who must be interned following a decision by a competent authority. The communication of data on a missing person who is of age shall be subject to the person's consent.Article 981. Data on witnesses, persons summoned to appear before the judicial authorities in connection with criminal proceedings in order to account for acts for which they are being prosecuted, or persons who are to be served with a criminal judgment or a summons to report in order to serve a penalty involving deprivation of liberty shall be entered, at the request of the competent judicial authorities, for the purposes of communicating their place of residence or domicile.2. Information requested shall be communicated to the requesting Party in accordance with national law and the Conventions in force on mutual assistance in criminal matters.Article 991. Data on persons or vehicles shall be entered in accordance with the national law of the Contracting Party issuing the alert, for the purposes of discreet surveillance or of specific checks in accordance with paragraph 5.2. Such an alert may be issued for the purposes of prosecuting criminal offences and for the prevention of threats to public security:(a) where there is clear evidence that the person concerned intends to commit or is committing numerous and extremely serious criminal offences; or(b) where an overall assessment of the person concerned, in particular on the basis of past criminal offences, gives reason to suppose that that person will also commit extremely serious criminal offences in the future.3. In addition, the alert may be issued in accordance with national law, at the request of the authorities responsible for national security, where there is clear evidence that the information referred to in paragraph 4 is necessary in order to prevent a serious threat by the person concerned or other serious threats to internal or external national security. The Contracting Party issuing the alert shall be obliged to consult the other Contracting Parties beforehand.4. For the purposes of discreet surveillance, all or some of the following information may be collected and communicated to the authority issuing the alert when border checks or other police and customs checks are carried out within the country:(a) the fact that the person for whom or the vehicle for which an alert has been issued has been found;(b) the place, time or reason for the check;(c) the route and destination of the journey;(d) persons accompanying the person concerned or occupants of the vehicle;(e) the vehicle used;(f) objects carried;(g) the circumstances under which the person or the vehicle was found.During the collection of this information steps must be taken not to jeopardise the discreet nature of the surveillance.5. During the specific checks referred to in paragraph 1, persons, vehicles and objects carried may be searched in accordance with national law for the purposes referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3. If the specific check is not authorised under the law of a Contracting Party, it shall automatically be replaced, for that Contracting Party, by discreet surveillance.6. A requested Contracting Party may add to the alert in the data file of its national section of the Schengen Information System a flag prohibiting, until the flag is deleted, performance of the action to be taken on the basis of the alert for the purposes of discreet surveillance or specific checks. The flag must be deleted no later than 24 hours after the alert has been entered unless the Contracting Party refuses to take the action requested on legal grounds or for special reasons of expediency. Without prejudice to a flag or a refusal, the other Contracting Parties may carry out the action requested in the alert.Article 1001. Data on objects sought for the purposes of seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings shall be entered in the Schengen Information System.2. If a search brings to light an alert for an object which has been found, the authority which matched the two items of data shall contact the authority which issued the alert in order to agree on the measures to be taken. For this purpose, personal data may also be communicated in accordance with this Convention. The measures to be taken by the Contracting Party which found the object must be in accordance with its national law.3. The following categories of objects shall be entered:(a) motor vehicles with a cylinder capacity exceeding 50 cc which have been stolen, misappropriated or lost;(b) trailers and caravans with an unladen weight exceeding 750 kg which have been stolen, misappropriated or lost;(c) firearms which have been stolen, misappropriated or lost;(d) blank official documents which have been stolen, misappropriated or lost;(e) issued identity papers (passports, identity cards, driving licences) which have been stolen, misappropriated or lost;(f) banknotes (suspect notes).Article 1011. Access to data entered in the Schengen Information System and the right to search such data directly shall be reserved exclusively to the authorities responsible for:(a) border checks;(b) other police and customs checks carried out within the country, and the coordination of such checks.2. In addition, access to data entered in accordance with Article 96 and the right to search such data directly may be exercised by the authorities responsible for issuing visas, the central authorities responsible for examining visa applications and the authorities responsible for issuing residence permits and for the administration of legislation on aliens in the context of the application of the provisions of this Convention relating to the movement of persons. Access to data shall be governed by the national law of each Contracting Party.3. Users may only search data which they require for the performance of their tasks.4. Each Contracting Party shall send the Executive Committee a list of competent authorities which are authorised to search the data contained in the Schengen Information System directly. That list shall specify, for each authority, which data it may search and for what purposes.CHAPTER 3PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND SECURITY OF DATA IN THE SCHENGEN INFORMATION SYSTEMArticle 1021. The Contracting Parties may use the data provided for in Articles 95 to 100 only for the purposes laid down for each category of alert referred to in those Articles.2. Data may only be copied for technical purposes, provided that such copying is necessary in order for the authorities referred to in Article 101 to carry out a direct search. Alerts issued by other Contracting Parties may not be copied from the national section of the Schengen Information System into other national data files.3. With regard to the alerts laid down in Articles 95 to 100 of this Convention, any derogation from paragraph 1 in order to change from one category of alert to another must be justified by the need to prevent an imminent serious threat to public policy and public security, on serious grounds of national security or for the purposes of preventing a serious criminal offence. Prior authorisation from the Contracting Party issuing the alert must be obtained for this purpose.4. Data may not be used for administrative purposes. By way of derogation, data entered under Article 96 may be used in accordance with the national law of each Contracting Party for the purposes of Article 101(2) only.5. Any use of data which does not comply with paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be considered as misuse under the national law of each Contracting Party.Article 103Each Contracting Party shall ensure that, on average, every 10th transmission of personal data is recorded in the national section of the Schengen Information System by the data file management authority for the purposes of checking whether the search is admissible or not. The record may only be used for this purpose and shall be deleted after six months.Article 1041. Alerts shall be governed by the national law of the Contracting Party issuing the alert unless more stringent conditions are laid down in this Convention.2. In so far as this Convention does not lay down specific provisions, the law of each Contracting Party shall apply to data entered in its national section of the Schengen Information System.3. In so far as this Convention does not lay down specific provisions concerning performance of the action requested in the alert, the national law of the requested Contracting Party performing the action shall apply. In so far as this Convention lays down specific provisions concerning performance of the action requested in the alert, responsibility for that action shall be governed by the national law of the requested Contracting Party. If the requested action cannot be performed, the requested Contracting Party shall immediately inform the Contracting Party issuing the alert.Article 105The Contracting Party issuing the alert shall be responsible for ensuring that the data entered into the Schengen Information System is accurate, up-to-date and lawful.Article 1061. Only the Contracting Party issuing the alert shall be authorised to modify, add to, correct or delete data which it has entered.2. If one of the Contracting Parties which has not issued the alert has evidence suggesting that an item of data is factually incorrect or has been unlawfully stored, it shall advise the Contracting Party issuing the alert thereof as soon as possible; the latter shall be obliged to check the communication and, if necessary, correct or delete the item in question immediately.3. If the Contracting Parties are unable to reach agreement, the Contracting Party which did not issue the alert shall submit the case to the joint supervisory authority referred to in Article 115(1) for its opinion.Article 107Where a person is already the subject of an alert in the Schengen Information System, a Contracting Party which enters a further alert shall reach agreement on the entry of the alert with the Contracting Party which entered the first alert. The Contracting Parties may also lay down general provisions to this end.Article 1081. Each Contracting Party shall designate an authority which shall have central responsibility for its national section of the Schengen Information System.2. Each Contracting Party shall issue its alerts via that authority.3. The said authority shall be responsible for the smooth operation of the national section of the Schengen Information System and shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Convention.4. The Contracting Parties shall inform one another, via the depositary, of the authority referred to in paragraph 1.Article 1091. The right of persons to have access to data entered in the Schengen Information System which relate to them shall be exercised in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party before which they invoke that right. If national law so provides, the national supervisory authority provided for in Article 114(1) shall decide whether information shall be communicated and by what procedures. A Contracting Party which has not issued the alert may communicate information concerning such data only if it has previously given the Contracting Party issuing the alert an opportunity to state its position.2. Communication of information to the data subject shall be refused if this is indispensable for the performance of a lawful task in connection with the alert or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of third parties. In any event, it shall be refused throughout the period of validity of an alert for the purpose of discreet surveillance.Article 110Any person may have factually inaccurate data relating to them corrected or unlawfully stored data relating to them deleted.Article 1111. Any person may, in the territory of each Contracting Party, bring before the courts or the authority competent under national law an action to correct, delete or obtain information or to obtain compensation in connection with an alert involving them.2. The Contracting Parties undertake mutually to enforce final decisions taken by the courts or authorities referred to in paragraph 1, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 116.Article 1121. Personal data entered into the Schengen Information System for the purposes of tracing persons shall be kept only for the time required to meet the purposes for which they were supplied. The Contracting Party which issued the alert must review the need for continued storage of such data not later than three years after they were entered. The period shall be one year in the case of the alerts referred to in Article 99.2. Each Contracting Party shall, where appropriate, set shorter review periods in accordance with its national law.3. The technical support function of the Schengen Information System shall automatically inform the Contracting Parties of scheduled deletion of data from the system one month in advance.4. The Contracting Party issuing the alert may, within the review period, decide to keep the alert should this prove necessary for the purposes for which the alert was issued. Any extension of the alert must be communicated to the technical support function. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to the extended alert.Article 1131. Data other than that referred to in Article 112 shall be kept for a maximum of 10 years, data on issued identity papers and suspect banknotes for a maximum of five years and data on motor vehicles, trailers and caravans for a maximum of three years.2. Data which have been deleted shall be kept for one year in the technical support function. During that period they may only be consulted for subsequent checking as to their accuracy and as to whether the data were entered lawfully. Afterwards they must be destroyed.Article 1141. Each Contracting Party shall designate a supervisory authority responsible in accordance with national law for carrying out independent supervision of the data file of the national section of the Schengen Information System and for checking that the processing and use of data entered in the Schengen Information System does not violate the rights of the data subject. For this purpose, the supervisory authority shall have access to the data file of the national section of the Schengen Information System.2. Any person shall have the right to ask the supervisory authorities to check data entered in the Schengen Information System which concern them and the use made of such data. That right shall be governed by the national law of the Contracting Party to which the request is made. If the data have been entered by another Contracting Party, the check shall be carried out in close coordination with that Contracting Party's supervisory authority.Article 1151. A joint supervisory authority shall be set up and shall be responsible for supervising the technical support function of the Schengen Information System. This authority shall consist of two representatives from each national supervisory authority. Each Contracting Party shall have one vote. Supervision shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data, taking into account Recommendation No R (87) 15 of 17 September 1987 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, and in accordance with the national law of the Contracting Party responsible for the technical support function.2. As regards the technical support function of the Schengen Information System, the joint supervisory authority shall have the task of checking that the provisions of this Convention are properly implemented. For that purpose, it shall have access to the technical support function.3. The joint supervisory authority shall also be responsible for examining any difficulties of application or interpretation that may arise during the operation of the Schengen Information System, for studying any problems that may occur with the exercise of independent supervision by the national supervisory authorities of the Contracting Parties or in the exercise of the right of access to the system, and for drawing up harmonised proposals for joint solutions to existing problems.4. Reports drawn up by the joint supervisory authority shall be submitted to the authorities to which the national supervisory authorities submit their reports.Article 1161. Each Contracting Party shall be liable in accordance with its national law for any injury caused to a person through the use of the national data file of the Schengen Information System. This shall also apply to injury caused by the Contracting Party which issued the alert, where the latter entered factually inaccurate data or stored data unlawfully.2. If the Contracting Party against which an action is brought is not the Contracting Party issuing the alert, the latter shall be required to reimburse, on request, the sums paid out as compensation unless the data were used by the requested Contracting Party in breach of this Convention.Article 1171.

With a view to implementing those uniform principles, the Contracting Parties must, in particular, promote the harmonisation of working methods for border control and surveillance.Moreover, the Executive Committee will examine all relevant measures with a view to establishing uniform and effective external border controls and the practical implementation thereof. Such measures will include measures making it possible to ascertain the circumstances under which a third-country national has entered the territories of the Contracting Parties, application of the same procedures for refusing entry, the drafting of a common manual for the officials responsible for border surveillance and encouragement of an equivalent level of external border control by means of exchanges and joint working visits.At the time of signing that Convention, they also confirmed the Central Negotiating Group's decision to set up a working party with the following mandate:- to inform the Central Negotiating Group before the entry into force of the Convention of all circumstances that have a significant bearing on the areas covered by the Convention and on its entry into force, in particular the progress achieved in harmonising legal provisions in connection with the unification of the two German States,- to consult each other on any impact that that harmonisation and those circumstances may have on the implementation of the Convention,- with a view to the movement of aliens exempt from the visa requirement, to devise practical measures and put forward proposals before the entry into force of the Convention for harmonising procedures for carrying out controls on persons at the future external borders.", "summary": "The Schengen area and cooperation\nThe Schengen area and cooperation\nSUMMARY OF:\nThe Schengen acquis — Agreement between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders\nThe Schengen acquis — Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE SCHENGEN AREA?\nIt aims to allow EU residents to travel across the internal borders of its member countries without being checked or having to show their passports.\nOpening up internal borders is one side of the Schengen coin. The other is to ensure the safety of its citizens. This involves tightening and applying uniform criteria on controls on entry by non-Schengen nationals at the common external border, developing cooperation between border guards, national police and judicial authorities and use of sophisticated information exchange systems.\nThe Schengen acquis has been amended as new countries joined the area and new EU legislation has been incorporated into it.\nKEY POINTS\nCooperation\nSchengen cooperation has developed from an initial plan between a few governments into a fully fledged EU policy area in the following stages:\n1985: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (Benelux), the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of France (5 of the then 10 European Economic Community (EEC) countries, now EU countries) sign an agreement, in the Luxembourg village of Schengen, on the gradual abolition of their internal border controls;\n1990: the same 5 countries sign the Schengen convention supplementing the agreement and laying down the measures and safeguards to put the policy of no internal border controls into effect;\n1995: implementation of the Schengen agenda begins with the participation of 7 EU countries;\n1997: the Treaty of Amsterdam brings Schengen cooperation between some governments into the EU’s legal framework.\nMembership\nFrom 5 founding members, the Schengen area now includes all 27 EU countries apart from Ireland (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are also Schengen countries but do not apply as yet the whole Schengen acquis).\nNon-EU countries Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein are also members of the Schengen area.\nInternal border checks in practice\nAnyone, whatever their nationality, may cross an internal border within the Schengen area without being checked.\nNational authorities can carry out police spot-checks either at the border or in border areas when these are based on general information and experience and are not systematic passport controls.\nIndividuals require certain travel documents, depending on whether they are EU nationals, non-EU family members or non-EU citizens.\nA Schengen country may exceptionally reintroduce border controls, initially for up to 30 days, if there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security. It must inform other Schengen members, the European Parliament, European Commission and the public.\nExternal borders\nThe Schengen area has gradually tightened controls on its external borders, integrating them into a single set of rules. This now covers:\npeople crossing an EU external border and how checks should be conducted, according to the Schengen Borders Code;\nharmonisation of entry conditions with a common visa policy and rules on short stay visas (up to 3 months);\ngreater police cooperation with rights of cross-border surveillance and hot pursuit;\nstronger judicial cooperation through a faster extradition system and transfer of enforcement of criminal judgments.\nSchengen Information System (SIS)\nThis large-scale computer database:\nsupports external border control and law enforcement cooperation between Schengen countries;\nwas created in 1995 and subsequently expanded, most recently in 2018 because of the new migration and security challenges;\ncontains information on suspected criminalsindividuals who may not have the right to enter or stay in the EUmissing personsstolen, misappropriated or lost property;\nis used by national authorities responsible for: border controlspolice and customs checkspublic prosecutions in criminal proceedings and judicial inquiries prior to chargevisas and residence permits;\nmay be accessed by the European Union’s law enforcement agency (Europol) and the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex).\nVisa Information System (VIS)\nThis allows Schengen members to share visa data, especially on short-term visa applications. Like the SIS, it is operated by the EU Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA).\nMembership conditions\nCountries applying to join fully the Schengen area must meet certain conditions and must be able to:\ncontrol their external borders and issue uniform Schengen visas;\ncooperate with other national law enforcement agencies to operate a high level of security;\napply the common set of Schengen rules (known as the Schengen acquis), such as land, sea and air border controls, issue visas, support police cooperation and protect personal data;\nuse the SIS.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe implementation of the Schengen Agreement, originally involving 7 EU countries, entered into force on 26 March 1995, abolishing internal border controls .\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nSchengen area (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nThe Schengen acquis — Agreement between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, pp. 13-18)\nThe Schengen acquis — Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, pp. 19-62)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1896 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2019 on the European Border and Coast Guard and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1052/2013 and (EU) 2016/1624 (OJ L 295, 14.11.2019, pp. 1-131)\nRegulation (EU) 2019/817 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems in the field of borders and visa and amending Regulations (EC) No 767/2008, (EU) 2016/399, (EU) 2017/2226, (EU) 2018/1240, (EU) 2018/1726 and (EU) 2018/1861 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Decisions 2004/512/EC and 2008/633/JHA (OJ L 135, 22.5.2019, pp. 27-84)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/817 have been incorporated into the original text.
