{"celex_id": "32009R0428", "reference": "29.5.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 134/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 428/2009\nof 5 May 2009\nsetting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items\n(Recast)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 of 22 June 2000 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology (1) has been significantly amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nDual-use items (including software and technology) should be subject to effective control when they are exported from the European Community.\n(3)\nAn effective common system of export controls on dual-use items is necessary to ensure that the international commitments and responsibilities of the Member States, especially regarding non-proliferation, and of the European Union (EU), are complied with.\n(4)\nThe existence of a common control system and harmonised policies for enforcement and monitoring in all Member States is a prerequisite for establishing the free movement of dual-use items inside the Community.\n(5)\nThe responsibility for deciding on individual, global or national general export authorisations, on authorisations for brokering services, on transits of non-Community dual-use items or on authorisations for the transfer within the Community of the dual-use items listed in Annex IV lies with national authorities. National provisions and decisions affecting exports of dual-use items must be taken in the framework of the common commercial policy, and in particular Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 of 20 December 1969 establishing common rules for exports (2).\n(6)\nDecisions to update the common list of dual-use items subject to export controls must be in conformity with the obligations and commitments that Member States have accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties.\n(7)\nCommon lists of dual-use items, destinations and guidelines are essential elements for an effective export control regime.\n(8)\nTransmission of software and technology by means of electronic media, fax or telephone to destinations outside the Community should also be controlled.\n(9)\nParticular attention needs to be paid to issues of re-export and end-use.\n(10)\nOn 22 September 1998 representatives of the Member States and the European Commission signed Protocols additional to the respective safeguards agreements between the Member States, the European Atomic Energy Community and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which, among other measures, oblige the Member States to provide information on transfers of specified equipment and non-nuclear material.\n(11)\nThe Community has adopted a body of customs rules, contained in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (3) (hereinafter the Community Customs Code) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (4) implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 which lay down, among other things, provisions relating to the export and re-export of goods. Nothing in this Regulation constrains any powers under and pursuant to the Community Customs Code and its implementing provisions.\n(12)\nPursuant to and within the limits of Article 30 of the Treaty and pending a greater degree of harmonisation, Member States retain the right to carry out controls on transfers of certain dual-use items within the Community in order to safeguard public policy or public security. Where these controls are linked to the effectiveness of controls on exports from the Community, they should be periodically reviewed by the Council.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure that this Regulation is properly applied, each Member State should take measures giving the competent authorities appropriate powers.\n(14)\nThe Heads of State or Government of the EU adopted in June 2003 an Action Plan on Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (Thessaloniki Action Plan). This Action Plan was complemented by the EU Strategy against proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003 (EU WMD Strategy). According to Chapter III of this Strategy, the European Union must make use of all its instruments to prevent, deter, halt, and if possible eliminate proliferation programmes that cause concern at global level. Subparagraph 30.A(4) of that Chapter specifically refers to strengthening export control policies and practices.\n(15)\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, adopted on 28 April 2004, decides that all States shall take and enforce effective measures to establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery, including by establishing appropriate controls over related materials and to this end shall, among others, establish transit and brokering controls. Related materials are materials, equipment and technology covered by relevant multilateral treaties and arrangements, or included on national control lists, which could be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery.\n(16)\nThis Regulation includes items which only pass through the territory of the Community, that is, those items which are not assigned a customs-approved treatment or use other than the external transit procedure or which are merely placed in a free zone or free warehouse and where no record of them has to be kept in an approved stock record. Accordingly, a possibility for Member States’ authorities to prohibit on a case-by-case basis the transit of non-Community dual-use items should be established, where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting from intelligence or other sources that the items are or may be intended in their entirety or in part for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or of their means of delivery.\n(17)\nControls should also be introduced on the provision of brokering services when the broker has been informed by competent national authorities or is aware that such provision might lead to production or delivery of weapons of mass destruction in a third country.\n(18)\nIt is desirable to achieve a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the EU in order to promote EU and international security and to provide a level playing field for EU exporters. It is therefore appropriate, in accordance with the recommendations of the Thessaloniki Action Plan and the calls of the EU WMD Strategy, to broaden the scope of consultation between Member States prior to granting an export authorisation. Among the benefits of this approach would be, for example, an assurance that a Member State's essential security interests would not be threatened by an export from another Member State. Greater convergence of conditions implementing national controls on dual-use items not listed in this Regulation, and harmonisation of the conditions of use of the different types of authorisations that may be granted under this Regulation would bring about more uniform and consistent application of controls. Improving the definition of intangible transfers of technology, to include making available controlled technology to persons located outside the EU, would assist the effort to promote security as would further alignment of the modalities for exchanging sensitive information among Member States with those of the international export control regimes, in particular by providing for the possibility of establishing a secure electronic system for sharing information among Member States.\n(19)\nEach Member State should determine effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties applicable in the event of breach of the provisions of this Regulation,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation sets up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n1.\n‘dual-use items’ shall mean items, including software and technology, which can be used for both civil and military purposes, and shall include all goods which can be used for both non-explosive uses and assisting in any way in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices;\n2.\n‘export’ shall mean:\n(i)\nan export procedure within the meaning of Article 161 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 (the Community Customs Code);\n(ii)\na re-export within the meaning of Article 182 of that Code but not including items in transit; and\n(iii)\ntransmission of software or technology by electronic media, including by fax, telephone, electronic mail or any other electronic means to a destination outside the European Community; it includes making available in an electronic form such software and technology to legal and natural persons and partnerships outside the Community.

An authorisation shall be required for the export of the dual-use items listed in Annex I.\n2.   Pursuant to Article 4 or Article 8, an authorisation may also be required for the export to all or certain destinations of certain dual-use items not listed in Annex I.\nArticle 4\n1.   An authorisation shall be required for the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if the exporter has been informed by the competent authorities of the Member State in which he is established that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for use in connection with the development, production, handling, operation, maintenance, storage, detection, identification or dissemination of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or the development, production, maintenance or storage of missiles capable of delivering such weapons.\n2.   An authorisation shall also be required for the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if the purchasing country or country of destination is subject to an arms embargo decided by a common position or joint action adopted by the Council or a decision of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) or an arms embargo imposed by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations and if the exporter has been informed by the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for a military end-use. For the purposes of this paragraph, ‘military end-use’ shall mean:\n(a)\nincorporation into military items listed in the military list of Member States;\n(b)\nuse of production, test or analytical equipment and components therefor, for the development, production or maintenance of military items listed in the abovementioned list;\n(c)\nuse of any unfinished products in a plant for the production of military items listed in the abovementioned list.\n3.

If an exporter is aware that dual-use items which he proposes to export, not listed in Annex I, are intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, he must notify the authorities referred to in paragraph 1, which will decide whether or not it is expedient to make the export concerned subject to authorisation.\n5.   A Member State may adopt or maintain national legislation imposing an authorisation requirement on the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if the exporter has grounds for suspecting that those items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraph 1.\n6.   A Member State which imposes an authorisation requirement, in application of paragraphs 1 to 5, on the export of a dual-use item not listed in Annex I, shall, where appropriate, inform the other Member States and the Commission. The other Member States shall give all due consideration to this information and shall inform their customs administration and other relevant national authorities.\n7.   The provisions of Article 13(1), (2) and (5) to (7) shall apply to cases concerning dual-use items not listed in Annex I.\n8.   This Regulation is without prejudice to the right of Member States to take national measures under Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69.\nArticle 5\n1.   An authorisation shall be required for brokering services of dual-use items listed in Annex I if the broker has been informed by the competent authorities of the Member State in which he is resident or established that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1). If a broker is aware that the dual-use items listed in Annex I for which he proposes brokering services are intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1), he must notify the competent authorities which will decide whether or not it is expedient to make such brokering services subject to authorisation.\n2.   A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items for uses referred to in Article 4(1) and to dual-use items for military end use and destinations referred to in Article 4(2).\n3.   A Member State may adopt or maintain national legislation imposing an authorisation requirement on the brokering of dual-use items, if the broker has grounds for suspecting that these items are or may be intended for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1).\n4.   The provisions of Article 8(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.\nArticle 6\n1.   The transit of non-Community dual-use items listed in Annex I may be prohibited by the competent authorities of the Member State where the transit occurs if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for uses referred to in Article 4(1). When deciding on such a prohibition the Member States shall take into account their obligations and commitments they have agreed to as parties to international treaties or as members of international non-proliferation regimes.\n2.   Before deciding whether or not to prohibit a transit a Member State may provide that its competent authorities may impose in individual cases an authorisation requirement for the specific transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for uses referred to in Article 4(1).\n3.   A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items for uses referred to in Article 4(1) and to dual-use items for military end use and destinations referred to in Article 4(2).\n4.   The provisions of Article 8(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.\nArticle 7\nThis Regulation does not apply to the supply of services or the transmission of technology if that supply or transmission involves cross-border movement of persons.\nArticle 8\n1.   A Member State may prohibit or impose an authorisation requirement on the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I for reasons of public security or human rights considerations.\n2.   Member States shall notify the Commission of any measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 immediately after their adoption and indicate the precise reasons for the measures.\n3.   Member States shall also immediately notify the Commission of any modifications to measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 1.\n4.   The Commission shall publish the measures notified to it pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nCHAPTER III\nEXPORT AUTHORISATION AND AUTHORISATION FOR BROKERING SERVICES\nArticle 9\n1.   A Community General Export Authorisation for certain exports as set out in Annex II is established by this Regulation.\n2.   For all other exports for which an authorisation is required under this Regulation, such authorisation shall be granted by the competent authorities of the Member State where the exporter is established. Subject to the restrictions specified in paragraph 4, this authorisation may be an individual, global or general authorisation.\nAll the authorisations shall be valid throughout the Community.\nExporters shall supply the competent authorities with all relevant information required for their applications for individual and global export authorisation so as to provide complete information to the national competent authorities in particular on the end user, the country of destination and the end use of the item exported. The authorisation may be subject, if appropriate, to an end-use statement.\n3.   Member States shall process requests for individual or global authorisations within a period of time to be determined by national law or practice.\n4.   National general export authorisations shall:\n(a)\nexclude from their scope items listed in part 2 of Annex II;\n(b)\nbe defined by national law or practice. They may be used by all exporters, established or resident in the Member State issuing these authorisations, if they meet the requirements set in this Regulation and in the complementary national legislation. They shall be issued in accordance with the indications set out in Annex IIIc. They shall be issued according to national law or practice;\nMember States shall notify the Commission immediately of any national general export authorisations issued or modified. The Commission shall publish these notifications in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union;\n(c)\nnot be used if the exporter has been informed by his authorities that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 4 or in paragraph 2 of Article 4 in a country subject to an arms embargo decided by a common position or joint action adopted by the Council or a decision of the OSCE or an arms embargo imposed by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations, or if the exporter is aware that the items are intended for the abovementioned uses.\n5.   Member States shall maintain or introduce in their respective national legislation the possibility of granting a global export authorisation.\n6.   Member States shall supply the Commission with a list of the authorities empowered to:\n(a)\ngrant export authorisations for dual-use items;\n(b)\ndecide to prohibit the transit of non-Community dual-use items under this Regulation.\nThe Commission shall publish the list of these authorities in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 10\n1.   Authorisations for brokering services under this Regulation shall be granted by the competent authorities of the Member State where the broker is resident or established. These authorisations shall be granted for a set quantity of specific items moving between two or more third countries. The location of the items in the originating third country, the end-user and its exact location must be clearly identified. The authorisations shall be valid throughout the Community.\n2.   Brokers shall supply the competent authorities with all relevant information required for their application for authorisation under this Regulation for brokering services, in particular details of the location of the dual-use items in the originating third country, a clear description of the items and the quantity involved, third parties involved in the transaction, the third country of destination, the end-user in that country and its exact location.\n3.   Member States shall process requests for authorisations for brokering services within a period of time to be determined by national law or practice.\n4.   Member States shall supply the Commission with a list of the authorities empowered to grant authorisations under this Regulation for the provision of brokering services. The Commission shall publish the list of these authorities in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 11\n1.   If the dual-use items in respect of which an application has been made for an individual export authorisation to a destination not listed in Annex II or to any destination in the case of dual-use items listed in Annex IV are or will be located in one or more Member States other than the one where the application has been made, that fact shall be indicated in the application. The competent authorities of the Member State to which the application for authorisation has been made shall immediately consult the competent authorities of the Member State or States in question and provide the relevant information. The Member State or States consulted shall make known within 10 working days any objections it or they may have to the granting of such an authorisation, which shall bind the Member State in which the application has been made.\nIf no objections are received within 10 working days, the Member State or States consulted shall be regarded as having no objection.\nIn exceptional cases, any Member State consulted may request the extension of the 10-day period. However, the extension may not exceed 30 working days.\n2.   If an export might prejudice its essential security interests, a Member State may request another Member State not to grant an export authorisation or, if such authorisation has been granted, request its annulment, suspension, modification or revocation. The Member State receiving such a request shall immediately engage in consultations of a non-binding nature with the requesting Member State, to be terminated within 10 working days. In case the requested Member State decides to grant the authorisation, this should be notified to the Commission and other Member States using the electronic system mentioned in Article 13(6).\nArticle 12\n1.   In deciding whether or not to grant an individual or global export authorisation or to grant an authorisation for brokering services under this Regulation, the Member States shall take into account all relevant considerations including:\n(a)\nthe obligations and commitments they have each accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties;\n(b)\ntheir obligations under sanctions imposed by a common position or a joint action adopted by the Council or by a decision of the OSCE or by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations;\n(c)\nconsiderations of national foreign and security policy, including those covered by Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment (5);\n(d)\nconsiderations about intended end use and the risk of diversion.\n2.   In addition to the criteria set in paragraph 1, when assessing an application for a global export authorisation Member States shall take into consideration the application by the exporter of proportionate and adequate means and procedures to ensure compliance with the provisions and objectives of this Regulation and with the terms and conditions of the authorisation.\nArticle 13\n1.   The competent authorities of the Member States, acting in accordance with this Regulation, may refuse to grant an export authorisation and may annul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authorisation which they have already granted. Where they refuse, annul, suspend, substantially limit or revoke an export authorisation or when they have determined that the intended export is not to be authorised, they shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission thereof and share the relevant information with them. In case the competent authorities of a Member State have suspended an export authorisation, the final assessment shall be communicated to the Member States and the Commission at the end of the period of suspension.\n2.   The competent authorities of Member States shall review denials of authorisations notified under paragraph 1 within three years of their notification and revoke them, amend them or renew them. The competent authorities of the Member States will notify the results of the review to the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission as soon as possible. Denials which are not revoked shall remain valid.\n3.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the Member States and the Commission of their decisions to prohibit a transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I taken under Article 6 without delay. These notifications will contain all relevant information including the classification of the item, its technical parameters, the country of destination and the end user.\n4.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to authorisations for brokering services.\n5.   Before the competent authorities of a Member State, acting under this Regulation, grant an authorisation for export or brokering services or decide on a transit they shall examine all valid denials or decisions to prohibit a transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I taken under this Regulation to ascertain whether an authorisation or a transit has been denied by the competent authorities of another Member State or States for an essentially identical transaction (meaning an item with essentially identical parameters or technical characteristics to the same end user or consignee). They shall first consult the competent authorities of the Member State or States which issued such denial(s) or decisions to prohibit the transit as provided for in paragraphs 1 and 3. If following such consultation the competent authorities of the Member State decide to grant an authorisation or allow the transit, they shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission, providing all relevant information to explain the decision.\n6.   All notifications required under this Article will be made via secure electronic means including via a secure system that may be set up in accordance with Article 19(4).\n7.   All information shared in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall be in compliance with the provisions of Article 19(3), (4) and (6) concerning the confidentiality of such information.\nArticle 14\n1.   All individual and global export authorisations and authorisations for brokering services shall be issued in writing or by electronic means on forms containing at least all the elements and in the order set out in the models which appear in Annexes IIIa and IIIb.\n2.   At the request of exporters, global export authorisations that contain quantitative limitations shall be split.\nCHAPTER IV\nUPDATING OF LIST OF DUAL-USE ITEMS\nArticle 15\n1.   The list of dual-use items set out in Annex I shall be updated in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any modification thereof, that Member States have accepted as members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties.\n2.   Annex IV, which is a subset of Annex I, shall be updated with regard to Article 30 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, namely the public policy and public security interests of the Member States.\nCHAPTER V\nCUSTOMS PROCEDURES\nArticle 16\n1.   When completing the formalities for the export of dual-use items at the customs office responsible for handling the export declaration, the exporter shall furnish proof that any necessary export authorisation has been obtained.\n2.   A translation of any documents furnished as proof into an official language of the Member State where the export declaration is presented may be required of the exporter.\n3.   Without prejudice to any powers conferred on it under, and pursuant to, the Community Customs Code, a Member State may also, for a period not exceeding the periods referred to in paragraph 4, suspend the process of export from its territory, or, if necessary, otherwise prevent the dual-use items listed in Annex I which are covered by a valid export authorisation from leaving the Community via its territory, where it has grounds for suspicion that:\n(a)\nrelevant information was not taken into account when the authorisation was granted, or\n(b)\ncircumstances have materially changed since the grant of the authorisation.\n4.   In the case referred to in paragraph 3, the competent authorities of the Member State which granted the export authorisation shall be consulted forthwith in order that they may take action pursuant to Article 13(1). If such competent authorities decide to maintain the authorisation, they shall reply within 10 working days, which, at their request, may be extended to 30 working days in exceptional circumstances. In such case, or if no reply is received within 10 or 30 days, as the case may be, the dual-use items shall be released immediately. The Member State which granted the authorisation shall inform the other Member States and the Commission.\nArticle 17\n1.   Member States may provide that customs formalities for the export of dual-use items may be completed only at customs offices empowered to that end.\n2.   Member States availing themselves of the option set out in paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of the duly empowered customs offices. The Commission shall publish the information in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 18\nThe provisions of Articles 843 and 912a to 912g of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 shall apply to the restrictions relating to the export, re-export and exit from the customs territory of dual-use items for the export of which an authorisation is required under this Regulation.\nCHAPTER VI\nADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nArticle 19\n1.   Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall take all appropriate measures to establish direct cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities, in particular to eliminate the risk that possible disparities in the application of export controls to dual-use items may lead to a deflection of trade, which could create difficulties for one or more Member States.\n2.   Member States shall take all appropriate measures to establish direct cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities with a view to enhance the efficiency of the Community export control regime. Such information may include:\n(a)\ndetails of exporters deprived, by national sanctions, of the right to use the national general export authorisations or Community General Export Authorisations;\n(b)\ndata on sensitive end users, actors involved in suspicious procurement activities, and, where available, routes taken.\n3.   Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (6), and in particular the provisions on the confidentiality of information, shall apply mutatis mutandis, without prejudice to Article 23 of this Regulation.\n4.   A secure and encrypted system for the exchange of information among Member States and whenever appropriate the Commission may be set up by the Commission, in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group set up under Article 23.\n5.   The provision of guidance to exporters and brokers will be the responsibility of the Member States where they are resident or established. The Commission and the Council may also make available guidance and/or recommendations for best practices for the subjects referred to in this Regulation.\n6.   The processing of personal data shall be in accordance with the rules laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the movement of such data (7) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (8).\nCHAPTER VII\nCONTROL MEASURES\nArticle 20\n1.   Exporters of dual-use items shall keep detailed registers or records of their exports, in accordance with the national law or practice in force in the respective Member States. Such registers or records shall include in particular commercial documents such as invoices, manifests and transport and other dispatch documents containing sufficient information to allow the following to be identified:\n(a)\nthe description of the dual-use items;\n(b)\nthe quantity of the dual-use items;\n(c)\nthe name and address of the exporter and of the consignee;\n(d)\nwhere known, the end-use and end-user of the dual-use items.\n2.   In accordance with national law or practice in force in the respective Member States, brokers shall keep registers or records for brokering services which fall under the scope of Article 5 so as to be able to prove, on request, the description of the dual-use items that were the subject of brokering services, the period during which the items were the subject of such services and their destination, and the countries concerned by those brokering services.\n3.

Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or \"laser\" irradiation.\nCVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.\nPack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.\nThe gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.\nb.\nThermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates.\nThe addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process.\nThe use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes.\nSpecific TE-PVD processes are as follows:\n1.\nElectron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;\n2.\nIon Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;\n3.\n\"Laser\" Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave \"laser\" beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;\n4.\nCathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition.\nThis definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.\n5.\nIon Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.\nc.\nPack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:\n1.\nThe metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);\n2.\nAn activator (normally a halide salt); and\n3.\nAn inert powder, most frequently alumina.\nThe substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1 030 K (757 °C) and 1 375 K (1 102 °C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating.\nd.\nPlasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.\nLow pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.\nHigh velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 °C) at 0,1 MPa.\ne.\nSlurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.\nf.\nSputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.\nThe Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials.\nLow-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.\ng.\nIon Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.\nCATEGORY 3\nELECTRONICS\n3ASystems, Equipment and Components\nThe control status of equipment and components described in 3A001 or 3A002, other than those described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.10. or 3A001.a.12., which are specially designed for or which have the same functional characteristics as other equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.\nThe control status of integrated circuits described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.9. or 3A001.a.12. which are unalterably programmed or designed for a specific function for another equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.\nWhen the manufacturer or applicant cannot determine the control status of the other equipment, the control status of the integrated circuits is determined in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.9. and 3A001.a.12.\n3A001Electronic components and specially designed components therefor, as follows:\na.\nGeneral purpose integrated circuits, as follows:\nThe control status of wafers (finished or unfinished), in which the function has been determined, is to be evaluated against the parameters of 3A001.a.\nIntegrated circuits include the following types:\n—\n\"Monolithic integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Hybrid integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Multichip integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Film type integrated circuits\", including silicon-on-sapphire integrated circuits;\n—\n\"Optical integrated circuits\".\n1.\nIntegrated circuits designed or rated as radiation hardened to withstand any of the following:\na.\nA total dose of 5 × 103 Gy (silicon) or higher;\nb.\nA dose rate upset of 5 × 106 Gy (silicon)/s or higher;\nc.\nA fluence (integrated flux) of neutrons (1 MeV equivalent) of 5 × 1013 n/cm2 or higher on silicon, or its equivalent for other materials;\n3A001.a.1.c. does not apply to Metal Insulator Semiconductors (MIS).\n2.\n\"Microprocessor microcircuits\", \"microcomputer microcircuits\", microcontroller microcircuits, storage integrated circuits manufactured from a compound semiconductor, analogue-to-digital converters, digital-to-analogue converters, electro-optical or \"optical integrated circuits\" designed for \"signal processing\", field programmable logic devices, custom integrated circuits for which either the function is unknown or the control status of the equipment in which the integrated circuit will be used is unknown, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processors, electrical erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), flash memories or static random-access memories (SRAMs), having any of the following:\na.\nRated for operation at an ambient temperature above 398 K (125 °C);\nb.\nRated for operation at an ambient temperature below 218 K (–55 °C);\nc.\nRated for operation over the entire ambient temperature range from 218 K (–55 °C) to 398 K (125 °C);\n3A001.a.2. does not apply to integrated circuits for civil automobiles or railway train applications.\n3.\n\"Microprocessor microcircuits\", \"microcomputer microcircuits\" and microcontroller microcircuits, manufactured from a compound semiconductor and operating at a clock frequency exceeding 40 MHz;\n3A001.a.3. includes digital signal processors, digital array processors and digital coprocessors.\n4.\nStorage integrated circuits manufactured from a compound semiconductor;\n5.\nAnalogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue converter integrated circuits, as follows:\na.\nAnalogue-to-digital converters having any of the following:\nN.B.\nSEE ALSO 3A101\n1.\nA resolution of 8 bit or more, but less than 10 bit, with an output rate greater than 500 million words per second;\n2.\nA resolution of 10 bit or more, but less than 12 bit, with an output rate greater than 200 million words per second;\n3.\nA resolution of 12 bit with an output rate greater than 105 million words per second;\n4.\nA resolution of more than 12 bit, but equal to or less than 14 bit, with an output rate greater than 10 million words per second;\n5.\nA resolution of more than 14 bit with an output rate greater than 2,5 million words per second;\nb.\nDigital-to-analogue converters with a resolution of 12 bit or more and a \"settling time\" of less than 10 ns;\nTechnical Notes:\n1.\nA resolution of n bit corresponds to a quantisation of 2n levels.\n2.\nThe number of bits in the output word is equal to the resolution of the analogue-to-digital converter.\n3.\nThe output rate is the maximum output rate of the converter, regardless of the architecture or oversampling.

brokering and transit of dual-use items\nNote: Regulation (EU) 2021/821 recasts and repeals Regulation (EC) No 428/2009. However, as stipulated in Article 31 of Regulation (EU) 2021/821, for authorisation applications made before 9 September 2021, the relevant rules of Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 shall continue to apply.\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt sets out a uniform European Union (EU) system to control the export, transfer, transit and brokering* of dual-use items*. This system seeks to ensure that the EU complies with its international commitments and responsibilities, especially regarding non-proliferation (i.e. preventing the spread of nuclear weapons).\nIt lays down a common EU control list and the rules for its implementation. An export authorisation is required to export a dual-use item from the EU to a non-EU country.\nKEY POINTS\nDual-use items are goods and technology for civilian but also military use, including items that may assist in any way in the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or other nuclear devices.\nTrade in dual-use items represents a sizeable portion of the EU’s external trade; the most recent data confirm that the volume of controlled dual-use exports from the EU was up to €85 billion.\nEU list of dual-use items\nAnnex I of the regulation provides a list of dual-use items that require authorisation. By means of delegated acts adopted by the European Commission, Annex I is updated each year to align it with international rules and commitments undertaken by: the Australia Group,the Missile Technology Control Regime,the Nuclear Suppliers Group,the Wassenaar Arrangement on export controls for conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, andthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\nThe export of certain dual-use items not listed in Annex I may be subject to authorisation when there is reason to believe that they are intended for use in connection with a biological, chemical, nuclear weapons or ballistic missile weapons programme or for military use in countries subject to an arms embargo.\nIn exceptional cases, EU Member States may impose additional controls on non-listed items for public security or human rights reasons.\nMember States also apply restrictions on the brokering services of dual-use items and on their transit through the EU.\nWith the exception of some sensitive items listed in Annex IV of the regulation (such as electrically driven explosive detonators), dual-use items may be freely traded within the EU.\nExport authorisations\nThere are four types of export authorisations, as indicated below.\nEU general export authorisations allow the export of certain dual-use items to certain countries and under certain conditions (see Annex II of the regulation). They cover, for example: exports of certain dual-use items to countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States;exports of certain dual-use items after repair/replacement;temporary exports of some dual-use items for exhibitions/fairs;exports of certain telecommunications items and chemicals to certain destinations.\nNational general export authorisations may be issued by Member States if they are consistent with existing EU general export authorisations and do not refer to items listed in Annex II of the regulation (e.g. uranium; human and animal pathogens such as certain viruses, including Ebola).\nGlobal licences are issued by national authorities to one exporter and may cover multiple items to multiple countries or end users.\nIndividual licenses are issued by national authorities to one exporter and cover exports of one or more dual-use items to one end user or consignee in a non-EU country.\nNetwork of export control authorities\nThe regulation sets up a network of competent export control authorities, coordinated by the Dual-Use Coordination Group, which exchanges information on export controls and develops tools to support its implementation.\nThe export control policy review\nThe regulation requires the Commission to conduct a review of EU export control policy. In October 2013, the Commission presented an implementation and impact assessment report to the European Parliament and the European Council. It concludes that the current export control regime, while providing solid legal and institutional foundations, should be upgraded in order to generate the modern control capabilities the EU will need in future.\nIn April 2014, a communication was adopted outlining a long-term vision for EU strategic export controls and identifying concrete policy options for the modernisation of the export control system. In 2015, the Commission conducted an impact assessment and presented a legislative proposal to modernise EU export controls in September 2016.\nRepeal of Regulation (EC) No 428/2009\nRegulation (EU) 2021/821 recasts and repeals Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 with effect from 9 September 2021.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 27 August 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nDual-use export controls (European Commission)\nCommission’s actions to implement new EU export control regulation — Memo (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nBrokering. The work of intermediaries who buy and sell on behalf of others.\nDual-use items. Items that can be used for both civil and military purposes, such as uranium, which can be used both for power generation and in nuclear weapons.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (OJ L 134, 29.5.2009, pp. 1–269).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 have been incorporated in to the original document.
