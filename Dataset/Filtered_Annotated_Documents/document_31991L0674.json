Whereas Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty on  the annual accounts of certain types of companies (4), as last amended by Directive 90/605/EEC (5),  need not be applied to insurance companies, hereinafter referred to as 'insurance undertakings`,  pending further coordination; whereas, in view of the major importance of insurance undertakings in  the Community, such coordination cannot be delayed any longer following the implementation of  Directive 78/660/EEC; Whereas Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty on  consolidated accounts (6), as last amended by Directive 90/605/EEC, provides for derogations for  insurance undertakings only until the expiry of the deadline imposed for the application of this  Directive; whereas this Directive must therefore also include provisions specific to insurance  undertakings in respect of consolidated accounts; Whereas such coordination is also urgently required because insurance undertakings operate across  borders; whereas for creditors, debtors, members, policyholders and their advisers and for the  general public, improved comparability of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of such  undertakings is of crucial importance; Whereas in the Member States insurance undertakings of different legal forms are in competition  with each other; whereas undertakings engaged in the business of direct insurance customarily  engage in the business of reinsurance as well and are therefore in competition with specialist  reinsurance undertakings; whereas it is therefore appropriate not to confine coordination to the  legal forms covered by Directive 78/660/EEC, but to choose a scope that corresponds to that of  Council Directive 73/239/EEC of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and  administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance  other than life assurance (7), as last amended by Directive 90/618/EEC (8), and to that of Council  Directive 79/267/EEC of 5 March 1979 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative  provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct life assurance (1), as  last amended by Directive 90/619/EEC (2), but which also includes certain undertakings that are  excluded from the scope of those Directives and companies and firms which are reinsurance  undertakings; Whereas, although in view of the specific characteristics of insurance undertakings it would appear  appropriate to propose a separate Directive on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of  such undertakings, that does not necessarily require the establishment of a set of standards  different from those of Directive 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC; whereas such separate standards would  be neither appropriate nor consistent with the principles underlying the coordination of company  law since, given the important position they occupy in the Community economy, insurance  undertakings cannot be excluded from a framework of rules devised for undertakings generally;  whereas, for this reason, only the particular characteristics of insurance undertakings have been  taken into account and this Directive deals only with derogations from the rules laid down in  Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC; Whereas there are major differences in the structure and content of the balance sheets of insurance  undertakings in different Member States; whereas this Directive must therefore lay down the same  structure and the same item designations for the balance sheets of all Community insurance  undertakings; Whereas, if annual accounts and consolidated accounts are to be comparable, a number of basic  questions regarding the disclosure of certain transactions in the balance sheet must be settled; Whereas, in the interests of greater comparability, it is also necessary that the content of the  various balance sheet items be determined precisely; Whereas it may be useful to distinguish between the commitments of the insurer and those of the  reinsurer by showing in the assets the reinsurer's share of technical provisions as an asset; Whereas the structure of the profit and loss account should also be determined and certain items in  it should be defined; Whereas, given the specific nature of the insurance industry, it may be useful for unrealized gains  and losses to be dealt with in the profit and loss account; Whereas the comparability of figures in the balance sheet and profit and loss account also depends  basically on the values at which assets and liabilities are shown in the balance sheet; whereas for  a proper understanding of the financial situation of an insurance undertaking the current value of  investments as well as their value based upon the principle of purchase price or production cost  must be disclosed; whereas, however, the compulsory disclosure of the current value of investments,  at least in the notes on the accounts, is prescribed solely for purposes of comparability and  transparency and is not intended to lead to changes in the tax treatment of insurance  undertakings; Whereas in the calculation of life assurance provisions use may be made of actuarial methods  customarily applied on the market or accepted by the insurance-monitoring authorities; whereas  those methods may be implemented by any actuary or expert in accordance with the conditions which  may be laid down in national law and with due regard for the actuarial principles recognized in the  framework of the present and future coordination of the fundamental rules for the prudential and  financial monitoring of direct life assurance business; Whereas, in the calculation of the provision for claims outstanding, on the one hand, any implicit  discounting or deduction should be prohibited, and, on the other hand, precise conditions for  recourse to explicit discounting or deduction should be defined, for the sake of prudence and  transparency; Whereas, in view of the special nature of insurance undertakings, certain changes are necessary  with regard to the notes on annual accounts and on consolidated accounts; Whereas, in line with the intention of covering all insurance undertakings that come within the  scope of Directive 73/239/EEC and 79/267/EEC as well as certain others, derogations such as those  for small and medium-sized insurance undertakings in Directive 78/660/EEC are not provided for, but  certain small mutual associations which are excluded from the scope of Directives 73/239/EEC and  79/267/EEC should not be covered; Whereas for the same reasons the scope allowed Member States pursuant to Directive 83/349/EEC to  exempt parent undertakings of groups from compulsory consolidation if the undertakings to be  consolidated do not together exceed a certain size has not been extended to insurance  undertakings; Whereas in view of its particular nature special provisions are needed for the association of  underwriters known as Lloyd's; Whereas the provisions of this Directive also apply to the consolidated accounts drawn up by a  parent undertaking which is a financial holding company where its subsidiary undertakings are eiher  exclusively or mainly insurance undertakings; Whereas the examination of problems which arise in connection with this Directive, in particular  regarding its application, requires cooperation by representatives of the Member States and the  Commission in a contact committee; whereas, in order to avoid the proliferation of such committees,  it is desirable that such cooperation take place in the committee provided for in Article 52 of  Directive 78/660/EEC; whereas, however, when examining problems concerning insurance undertakings,  the committee must be appropriately constituted; Whereas, in view of the complexity of the matter, the insurance undertakings covered by this  Directive must be allowed an appropriate period to implement its provisions; whereas that period  must be extended to allow the necessary adjustments to be made concerning, on the one hand, the  association of underwriters known as Lloyd's and, on the other, those undertakings which, when this  Directive becomes applicable, show their investments at historical cost; Whereas provision should be made for the review of certain provisions of this Directive after five  years' experience of its application, in the light of the aims of greater transparency and  harmonization.

In life-assurance business Member States may permit the disclosure in full or in  part in items II (3) and (10) in the profit and loss account of variations in the difference  between: - the valuation of investments at their current value or by means of one of the methods referred to  in Article 33 (1) of Directive 78/660/EEC, and- their valuation at purchase price. In any event, Member States shall require that the amounts referred to in the first paragraph be  disclosed in the aforementioned items where they relate to investments shown as assets under D. 2.  Member States which require or permit the valuation of the investments shown as assets under C  at their current value may, in respect of non-life-insurance, permit the disclosure in full or in  part in an item III (3a) and in an item III (5a) in the profit and loss account of the variation in  the difference between the valuation of those investments at their current value and their  valuation at purchase price. SECTION 7 Valuation rules Article 45Article 32 of Directive 78/660/EEC, under which the  valuation of items shown in the annual accounts must be based on the principle of purchase price or  production cost, shall apply to investment subject to Articles 46 to 49 of this Directive. Article 461.  Member States may require or permit the valuation of investments shown as assets  under C on the basis of their current value calculated in accordance with Articles 48 and 49. 2.  The investments shown as assets under D shall be shown at their current value. 3.  Where investments are shown at their purchase price, their current value shall be disclosed in  the notes on the accounts. However, Member States in which, on the date of the notification of this Directive, investments are  shown at their purchase price may give undertakings the option of initially disclosing in the notes  on the account the current value of investment shown as assets under C (I) no later than five years  after the date referred to in Article 70 (1) and the current value of other investments no later  than three years after the same date. 4.  Where investments are shown at their current value, their purchase price shall be disclosed in  the notes on the accounts. 5.  The same valuation method shall be applied to all investments included in any item denoted by  an arabic numeral or shown as assets under C (I). 6.  The method applied to each investment item shall be stated in the notes on the accounts.

Where a market exists for investments other than those referred to in paragraph 2, market value  shall mean the average price at which such investments were traded on the balance-sheet date or,  when the balance-sheet date is not a trading day, on the last trading day before that date. 4.  Where on the date on which the accounts are drawn up investments such as referred to in  paragraphs 2 or 3 have been sold or are to be sold within the short term, the market value shall be  reduced by the actual or estimated realization costs. 5.  Except where the equity method is applied in accordance with Article 59 of Directive  78/660/EEC, all other investments shall be valued on a basis which has prudent regard to the likely  realizable value. 6.  In all cases the method of valuation shall be precisely described and the reason for adopting  it stated in the notes on the accounts. Article 491.  In the case of land and buildings current value shall mean the market value on the  date of valuation, where relevant reduced as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5. 2.  Market value shall mean the price at which land and buildings could be sold under private  contract between a willing seller and an arm's length buyer on the date of valuation, it being  assumed that the property is publicly exposed to the market, that market conditions permit orderly  disposal and that a normal period, having regard to the nature of the property, is available for  the negotiation of the sale. 3.  The market value shall be determined through the separate valuation of each land and buildings  item, carried out at least every five years according to methods generally recognized or recognized  by the insurance supervisory authorities. Article 35 (1) (b) of Directive 78/660/EEC shall not  apply. 4.  Where the value of any land and buildings item has diminished since the preceding valuation  under paragraph 3, an appropriate value adjustment shall be made. The lower value thus arrived at  shall not be increased in subsequent balance sheets unless such increase results from a new  determination of market value arrived at in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3. 5.  Where on the date on which the accounts are drawn up land and buildings have been sold or are  to be sold within the short term, the value arrived at in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4 shall  be reduced by the actual or estimated realization costs. 6.  Where it is impossible to determine the market value of a land and buildings item, the value  arrived at on the basis of the principle of purchase price or production cost shall be deemed to be  the current value. 7.  The method by which the current value of land and buildings has been arrived at and their  breakdown by financial year of valuation shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. Article 50Where Article 33 of Directive 78/660/EEC is applied to insurance undertakings, it  shall be so in the following manner: (a)  paragraph 1 (a) shall apply to assets shown under F (I) as defined in Article 6 of this  Directive; (b)paragraph 1 (c) shall apply to assets shown under C (I), (II), (III) and (IV) and F (I) (except  for stocks) and (III) as defined in Article 6 of this Directive.

Article 52Article 38 of Directive 78/660/EEC shall apply to assets shown under F (I) as defined  in Article 6 of this Directive. Article 53Article 39 of Directive 78/660/EEC shall apply to assets shown under E (I), (II) and  (III) and F (II) as defined in Article 6 of this Directive. Article 54In non-life insurance the amount of any deferred acquisition costs shall be  established on a basis compatible with that used for unearned premiums. In life assurance the calculation of the amount of any acquisition costs to be deferred may be  taken into the actuarial calculation referred to in Article 59. Article 551.  (a)  If they have not been valued at market value, debt securities and other  fixed-income securities shown as assets under C (II) and (III) shall be shown in the balance sheet  at purchase price. Member States may, however, require or permit such debt securities to be shown  in the balance sheet at the amount repayable at maturity. (b)Where the purchase price of the securities referred to in point (a) exceeds the amount  repayable at maturity, the amount of the difference shall be charged to the profit and loss  account. Member States may, however, require or permit the amount of the difference to be written  off in instalments so that it is completely written off when the securities are repaid. That  difference must be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. (c)Where the purchase price of the securities referred to in point (a) is less than the amount  repayable at maturity, Member States may require or permit the amount of the difference to be  released to income in instalments over the period remaining until repayment. That difference must  be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. 2.  Where debt securities or other fixed-income securities that are not valued at market value are  sold before maturity and the proceeds are used to purchase other debt securities or fixed-income  securities, Member States may permit the difference between the proceeds of sale and their book  value to be spread uniformly over the period remaining until the maturity of the original  investment. Article 56Technical provisionsThe amount of technical provisions must at all times be such that  an undertaking can meet any liabilities arising out of insurance contracts as far as can reasonably  be foreseen. Article 57Provision for unearned premiums1.  The provision for unearned premiums shall in  principle be computed separately for each insurance contract. Member States may, however, permit  the use of statistical methods, and in particular proportional and flat-rate methods, where they  may be expected to give approximately the same results as individual calculations. 2.  In classes of insurance where the assumption of a temporal correlation between risk experience  and premium is not appropriate, calculation methods shall be applied that take account of the  differing pattern of risk over time. Article 58Provision for unexpired risksThe provision for unexpired risks referred to in Article  26 shall be computed on the basis of claims and administrative expenses likely to arise after the  end of the financial year from contracts concluded before that date, in so far as their estimated  value exceeds the provision for unearned premiums and any premiums receivable under those  contracts. Article 59Life assurance provision1.  The life assurance provision shall in principle be  computed separately for each life assurance contract. Member States may, however, permit the use of  statistical or mathematical methods where they may be expected to give approximately the same  results as individual calculations. A summary of the principal assumptions made shall be given in  the notes on the accounts. 2.  The computation shall be made annually by an actuary or other specialist in this field on the  basis of recognized actuarial methods. Article 60Provisions for claims outstanding1.  Non-life insurance(a)  A provision shall in  principle be computed separately for each case on the basis of the costs still expected to arise.  Statistical methods may be used if they result in an adequate provision having regard to the nature  of the risks; Member States may, however, make the application of such methods subject to prior  approval. (b)This provision shall also allow for claims incurred but not reported by the balance-sheet date;  its amount shall be determined having regard to past experience as to the number and magnitude of  claims reported after the balance-sheet date. (c)Claims settlement costs shall be included in the calculation of the provision irrespective of  their origin. (d)  Recoverable amounts arising out of the acquisition of the rights of policyholders with respect  to third parties (subrogation) or of the legal ownership of insured property (salvage) shall be  deducted from the provision for claims outstanding; they shall be estimated on a prudent basis.  Where such amounts are material, they shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. (e)By way of derogation from subparagraph (d), Member States may require or permit the disclosure  of recoverable amounts as assets. (f)Where benefits resulting from a claim must be paid in the form of annuity, the amounts to be  set aside for that purpose shall be calculated by recognized actuarial methods. (g)Implicit discounting or deductions, whether resulting from the placing of a present value on a  provision for an outstanding claim which is expected to be settled later at a higher figure or  otherwise effected, shall be prohibited. Member States may permit explicit discounting or deductions to take account of investment income.  N° such discounting or deductions shall be permissible unless: ii(i)  the expected average date for the settlement of claims is at least four years after the  accounting date; i(ii)the discounting or deduction is effected on a recognized prudential basis; the competent  authority must be given advance notification of any change in method; (iii)when calculating the total cost of settling claims, an undertaking takes account of all  factors that could cause increases in that cost; (iv)an undertaking has adequate data at its disposal to construct a reliable model of the rate of  claims settlements; i(v)the rate of interest used for the calculation of present values does not exceed a prudent  estimate of the investment income from assets invested as a provision for claims during the period  necessary for the payment of such claims. Moreover, it must not exceed either of the following: - the investment income from such assets over the preceding five years, - the investment income from such assets during the year preceding the balance-sheet date. When discounting or effecting deductions, an undertaking shall, in the notes on its accounts,  disclose  the total amount of provisions before discounting or deduction, the categories of claims  which are discounted or from which deductions have been made and, for each category of claims, the  methods used, in particular the rates used for the estimates referred to in the preceding  subparagraph, points (iii) and (v), and the criteria adopted for estimating the period that will  elapse before the claims are settled. 2.  Life insurance(a)  The amount of the provision for claims shall be equal to the sums due to  beneficiaries, plus the costs of settling claims. It shall include the provision for claims  incurred but not reported. (b)Member States may require the disclosure in liabilities item C (2) of the amounts referred to  in (a). Article 611.  Pending further coordination, Member States may require or permit the application  of the following methods where, because of the nature of the class or type of insurance in  question, information about premiums receivable, claims payable or both for the underwriting years  is insufficient when the annual accounts are drawn up for accurate estimates to be made. Method 1The excess of the premiums written over the claims and expenses paid in respect of  contracts commencing in the underwriting year shall form a technical provision which is included in  the technical provision for claims outstanding shown in the balance sheet in liabilities item C  (3). The provision may also be computed on the basis of a given percentage of the premiums written  where such a method is appropriate for the type of risk insured. Should the need arise, the amount  of this technical provision shall be increased to make it sufficient to meet present and future  obligations. The technical provision constituted by this method shall be replaced by a provision  for claims outstanding estimated in the usual manner as soon as sufficient information has been  gathered and not later than the end of the third year following the underwriting year. Method 2The figures shown in the technical account or in certain items within it shall relate to a  year which wholly or partly precedes the financial year. It must not do so by more than 12 months.  The amounts of the technical provisions shown in the annual accounts shall if necessary be  increased to make them sufficient to meet present and future obligations. 2.  Where one of the methods described in paragraph 1 is adopted, it shall be applied  systematically in successive years unless circumstances justify a change. The use of either method  shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts and the reasons given; in the event of a change in  the method applied, the effect on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss  shall be indicated in the notes on the accounts. Where Method 1 is used, the length of time that  elapses before a provision for claims outstanding is constituted on the usual basis shall be  disclosed in the notes on the accounts. Where Method 2 is used, the length of time by which the  earlier year to which the figures relate precedes the financial year and the magnitude of the  transactions concerned shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. 3.  For the purposes of this Article, 'underwriting year` shall mean the financial year in which  the insurance contracts in the class or type of insurance in question commenced. Article 62Pending further coordination, those Member States which require the constitution of  equalization provisions shall prescribe the valuation rules to be applied to them. SECTION 8 Contents of the notes on the accounts Article 63In place of the information  provided for in Article 43 (1) (8) of Directive 78/660/EEC, insurance undertakings shall provide  the following particulars: III.

Unified management may also consist of important and durable  reinsurance links; 4. Member States may permit derogations from Article 26 (1) (c) of Directive 83/349/EEC where a  transaction has been concluded according to normal market conditions and has established  policyholder rights.

The underwriting account shall be prepared by analogy with the provisions governing the  preparation of the profit and loss account; it shall show, in addition: (a)  for each entry, the change in the figures since the preceding accounting date; (b)the allocated capacity of the syndicate for the relevant underwriting year of account.  2. Contents of aggregate accountsAggregate accounts shall be prepared by cumulation of the accounts  of all Lloyd's syndicates. They shall include a note giving details of: (a)  inter-syndicate business including premiums written and claims paid; (b)the method by which run-off years of account, referred to in paragraph 9, are taken into  account; (c)the method by which the premium income limit for individual members of Lloyd's syndicates is  calculated.  3. CapitalLloyd's and Lloyd's syndicates shall not be required to disclose, in the aggregate accounts  and dyndicate accounts respectively, figures for liabilities items A (I) (Subscribed capital or  equivalent fund), A (II) (Share premium account) and A (IV) (Reserves).

(d)Other accounting principlesIn all Lloyd's accounts: - like items shall receive uniform treatment, - reinsurance recoveries shall be taken into account in respect of open years where a syndicate has  paid a claim, - operating expenses shall be allocated to the underwriting year of account for which they are  incurred.  6. Technical provisionsSubject to paragraph 9 and by way of derogation from Articles 56 and 60,  technical provisions shall not appear in Lloyd's accounts. However: (a)  the underwriting accounts for open years shall show the excess of the premiums collected over  the claims and expenses paid, by analogy with Article 61; (b)a provision for claims outstanding shall be calculated when the underwriting year of account is  closed and shall be shown in accordance with paragraph 8.   7.

Contents of the notes on Lloyd's accountsIn the notes on Lloyd's accounts the meaning of gross  premiums shall be as set out in paragraph 12.", "summary": "Insurance companies: annual accounts\nInsurance companies: annual accounts\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 91/674/EEC on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt aims to ensure that the balance sheets of all EU insurance companies have the same layout and the same item headings in order to ensure comparability.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive applies to all insurance companies or firms except small mutual associations not carrying out insurance business.\nIt complemented the Fourth Council Directive (Directive 78/660/EEC) on annual accounts of companies with limited liability which has since been repealed and replaced by Directive 2013/34/EU (annual and consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings).\nEven if national accounting standards may differ across EU countries, the directive prescribes certain basic information in the interests of greater comparability of consolidated accounts. To this end, the content of the various balance sheet items is determined precisely.\nTo provide a proper understanding of the financial situation of an insurance companies, the current value of investments, as well as their value based upon the principle of the purchase price or production cost, must be disclosed; disclosure of the current value of investments is also required.\nFor life assurance provisions use may be made of actuarial methods which may be laid down in national law and with due regard for the actuarial principles recognised.\nLastly, for the calculation of the provision for claims outstanding, any implicit discounting or deduction is prohibited. On the other hand, in the interests of prudence and transparency, precise conditions for recourse to explicit discounting or deduction are defined.\nTo adapt accounting disclosures to insurance business models, certain requirements are set out relating to the content of the notes on the accounts, e.g. gross premiums broken down by category of activity (accident and health, motor, fire, etc.) and by geographical market.\nIt must be possible to obtain a copy of accounts and annual reports upon request at a price not exceeding their administrative cost.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 23 December 1991 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 1994.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 91/674/EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings (OJ L 374, 31.12.1991, pp.7-31)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 91/674/EEC have been incorporated into the original document.

Whereas Council directive 78/660/eec of 25 July 1978 based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty on  the annual accounts of certain types of companies (4), as last amended by directive 90/605/eec (5),  need not be applied to insurance companies, hereinafter referred to as 'insurance undertakings`,  pending further coordination; whereas, in view of the major importance of insurance undertakings in  the Community, such coordination cannot be delayed any longer following the implementation of  directive 78/660/eec; Whereas Council directive 83/349/eec of 13 June 1983 based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty on  consolidated accounts (6), as last amended by directive 90/605/eec, provides for derogations for  insurance undertakings only until the expiry of the deadline imposed for the application of this  Directive; whereas this Directive must therefore also include provisions specific to insurance  undertakings in respect of consolidated accounts; Whereas such coordination is also urgently required because insurance undertakings operate across  borders; whereas for creditors, debtors, members, policyholders and their advisers and for the  general public, improved comparability of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of such  undertakings is of crucial importance; Whereas in the Member States insurance undertakings of different legal forms are in competition  with each other; whereas undertakings engaged in the business of direct insurance customarily  engage in the business of reinsurance as well and are therefore in competition with specialist  reinsurance undertakings; whereas it is therefore appropriate not to confine coordination to the  legal forms covered by directive 78/660/eec, but to choose a scope that corresponds to that of  Council directive 73/239/eec of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and  administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance  other than life assurance (7), as last amended by directive 90/618/eec (8), and to that of Council  directive 79/267/eec of 5 March 1979 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative  provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct life assurance (1), as  last amended by directive 90/619/eec (2), but which also includes certain undertakings that are  excluded from the scope of those Directives and companies and firms which are reinsurance  undertakings; Whereas, although in view of the specific characteristics of insurance undertakings it would appear  appropriate to propose a separate Directive on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of  such undertakings, that does not necessarily require the establishment of a set of standards  different from those of directive 78/660/eec directive 83/349/eec; whereas such separate standards would  be neither appropriate nor consistent with the principles underlying the coordination of company  law since, given the important position they occupy in the Community economy, insurance  undertakings cannot be excluded from a framework of rules devised for undertakings generally;  whereas, for this reason, only the particular characteristics of insurance undertakings have been  taken into account and this Directive deals only with derogations from the rules laid down in  directive 78/660/eec directive 83/349/eec; Whereas there are major differences in the structure and content of the balance sheets of insurance  undertakings in different Member States; whereas this Directive must therefore lay down the same  structure and the same item designations for the balance sheets of all Community insurance  undertakings; Whereas, if annual accounts and consolidated accounts are to be comparable, a number of basic  questions regarding the disclosure of certain transactions in the balance sheet must be settled; Whereas, in the interests of greater comparability, it is also necessary that the content of the  various balance sheet items be determined precisely; Whereas it may be useful to distinguish between the commitments of the insurer and those of the  reinsurer by showing in the assets the reinsurer's share of technical provisions as an asset; Whereas the structure of the profit and loss account should also be determined and certain items in  it should be defined; Whereas, given the specific nature of the insurance industry, it may be useful for unrealized gains  and losses to be dealt with in the profit and loss account; Whereas the comparability of figures in the balance sheet and profit and loss account also depends  basically on the values at which assets and liabilities are shown in the balance sheet; whereas for  a proper understanding of the financial situation of an insurance undertaking the current value of  investments as well as their value based upon the principle of purchase price or production cost  must be disclosed; whereas, however, the compulsory disclosure of the current value of investments,  at least in the notes on the accounts, is prescribed solely for purposes of comparability and  transparency and is not intended to lead to changes in the tax treatment of insurance  undertakings; Whereas in the calculation of life assurance provisions use may be made of actuarial methods  customarily applied on the market or accepted by the insurance-monitoring authorities; whereas  those methods may be implemented by any actuary or expert in accordance with the conditions which  may be laid down in national law and with due regard for the actuarial principles recognized in the  framework of the present and future coordination of the fundamental rules for the prudential and  financial monitoring of direct life assurance business; Whereas, in the calculation of the provision for claims outstanding, on the one hand, any implicit  discounting or deduction should be prohibited, and, on the other hand, precise conditions for  recourse to explicit discounting or deduction should be defined, for the sake of prudence and  transparency; Whereas, in view of the special nature of insurance undertakings, certain changes are necessary  with regard to the notes on annual accounts and on consolidated accounts; Whereas, in line with the intention of covering all insurance undertakings that come within the  scope of directive 73/239/eec directive 79/267/eec as well as certain others, derogations such as those  for small and medium-sized insurance undertakings in directive 78/660/eec are not provided for, but  certain small mutual associations which are excluded from the scope of directive 73/239/eec directive 79/267/eec should not be covered; Whereas for the same reasons the scope allowed Member States pursuant to directive 83/349/eec to  exempt parent undertakings of groups from compulsory consolidation if the undertakings to be  consolidated do not together exceed a certain size has not been extended to insurance  undertakings; Whereas in view of its particular nature special provisions are needed for the association of  underwriters known as Lloyd's; Whereas the provisions of this Directive also apply to the consolidated accounts drawn up by a  parent undertaking which is a financial holding company where its subsidiary undertakings are eiher  exclusively or mainly insurance undertakings; Whereas the examination of problems which arise in connection with this Directive, in particular  regarding its application, requires cooperation by representatives of the Member States and the  Commission in a contact committee; whereas, in order to avoid the proliferation of such committees,  it is desirable that such cooperation take place in the committee provided for in Article 52 of  directive 78/660/eec; whereas, however, when examining problems concerning insurance undertakings,  the committee must be appropriately constituted; Whereas, in view of the complexity of the matter, the insurance undertakings covered by this  Directive must be allowed an appropriate period to implement its provisions; whereas that period  must be extended to allow the necessary adjustments to be made concerning, on the one hand, the  association of underwriters known as Lloyd's and, on the other, those undertakings which, when this  Directive becomes applicable, show their investments at historical cost; Whereas provision should be made for the review of certain provisions of this Directive after five  years' experience of its application, in the light of the aims of greater transparency and  harmonization. HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: SECTION 1 Preliminary provisions and scope Article 11.  Articles 2, 3, 4  (1), (3) to (5), 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 (3) and (4), 16 to 21, 29 to 35, 37 to 42, 43 (1), points 1 to 7  and 9 to 13, 45 (1), 46, 48 to 50, 51 (1), 54, 56 to 59 and 61 of directive 78/660/eec shall apply  to the undertakings referred to in Article 2 of this Directive, except where this Directive  provides otherwise. 2.

Article 21.  The coordination measures prescribed by this Directive shall apply to companies and  firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty which are: (a)  undertakings within the meaning of Article 1 of directive 73/239/eec, excluding those mutual  associations which are excluded from the scope of that Directive by virtue of Article 3 thereof but  including those bodies referred to in Article 4 (a), (b), (c) and (e) thereof except where their  activity does not consist wholly or mainly in carrying on insurance business; (b)undertakings within the meaning of Article 1 of directive 79/267/eec, excluding those bodies  and mutual associations referred to in Articles 2 (2) and (3) and 3 of that Directive;  or(c)undertakings carrying on reinsurance business.

The total amount of such assets and liabilities shall be shown separately or in the  notes on the accounts, broken down according to the various assets and liabilities items. However,  the Member States may permit the disclosure of such funds as off-balance-sheet items provided there  are special rules whereby such funds can be excluded from the assets available for distribution in  the event of the winding up of an insurance undertaking (or similar proceedings). Assets acquired in the name of and on behalf of third parties must not be shown in the balance  sheet. Article 3Those provisions of this Directive which relate to life assurance shall apply mutatis  mutandis to insurance undertakings which underwrite only health insurance and which do so  exclusively or principally according to the technical principles of life assurance. Member States may apply the first paragraph to health insurance underwritten by joint undertakings  according to the technical principles of life assurance where such activity is significant. Article 4This Directive shall apply to the association of underwriters known as Lloyd's subject  to the adaptations set out in the Annex to take account of the particular nature and structure of  Lloyd's.

Where the value of any land and buildings item has diminished since the preceding valuation  under paragraph 3, an appropriate value adjustment shall be made.

Article 54In non-life insurance the amount of any deferred acquisition costs shall be  established on a basis compatible with that used for unearned premiums. In life assurance the calculation of the amount of any acquisition costs to be deferred may be  taken into the actuarial calculation referred to in Article 59. Article 551.  (a)  If they have not been valued at market value, debt securities and other  fixed-income securities shown as assets under C (II) and (III) shall be shown in the balance sheet  at purchase price. Member States may, however, require or permit such debt securities to be shown  in the balance sheet at the amount repayable at maturity. (b)Where the purchase price of the securities referred to in point (a) exceeds the amount  repayable at maturity, the amount of the difference shall be charged to the profit and loss  account. Member States may, however, require or permit the amount of the difference to be written  off in instalments so that it is completely written off when the securities are repaid. That  difference must be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. (c)Where the purchase price of the securities referred to in point (a) is less than the amount  repayable at maturity, Member States may require or permit the amount of the difference to be  released to income in instalments over the period remaining until repayment. That difference must  be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. 2.  Where debt securities or other fixed-income securities that are not valued at market value are  sold before maturity and the proceeds are used to purchase other debt securities or fixed-income  securities, Member States may permit the difference between the proceeds of sale and their book  value to be spread uniformly over the period remaining until the maturity of the original  investment. Article 56Technical provisionsThe amount of technical provisions must at all times be such that  an undertaking can meet any liabilities arising out of insurance contracts as far as can reasonably  be foreseen. Article 57Provision for unearned premiums1.  The provision for unearned premiums shall in  principle be computed separately for each insurance contract. Member States may, however, permit  the use of statistical methods, and in particular proportional and flat-rate methods, where they  may be expected to give approximately the same results as individual calculations. 2.  In classes of insurance where the assumption of a temporal correlation between risk experience  and premium is not appropriate, calculation methods shall be applied that take account of the  differing pattern of risk over time. Article 58Provision for unexpired risksThe provision for unexpired risks referred to in Article  26 shall be computed on the basis of claims and administrative expenses likely to arise after the  end of the financial year from contracts concluded before that date, in so far as their estimated  value exceeds the provision for unearned premiums and any premiums receivable under those  contracts. Article 59Life assurance provision1.  The life assurance provision shall in principle be  computed separately for each life assurance contract. Member States may, however, permit the use of  statistical or mathematical methods where they may be expected to give approximately the same  results as individual calculations.

The computation shall be made annually by an actuary or other specialist in this field on the  basis of recognized actuarial methods. Article 60Provisions for claims outstanding1.  Non-life insurance(a)  A provision shall in  principle be computed separately for each case on the basis of the costs still expected to arise.  Statistical methods may be used if they result in an adequate provision having regard to the nature  of the risks; Member States may, however, make the application of such methods subject to prior  approval. (b)This provision shall also allow for claims incurred but not reported by the balance-sheet date;  its amount shall be determined having regard to past experience as to the number and magnitude of  claims reported after the balance-sheet date. (c)Claims settlement costs shall be included in the calculation of the provision irrespective of  their origin. (d)  Recoverable amounts arising out of the acquisition of the rights of policyholders with respect  to third parties (subrogation) or of the legal ownership of insured property (salvage) shall be  deducted from the provision for claims outstanding; they shall be estimated on a prudent basis.  Where such amounts are material, they shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. (e)By way of derogation from subparagraph (d), Member States may require or permit the disclosure  of recoverable amounts as assets. (f)Where benefits resulting from a claim must be paid in the form of annuity, the amounts to be  set aside for that purpose shall be calculated by recognized actuarial methods. (g)Implicit discounting or deductions, whether resulting from the placing of a present value on a  provision for an outstanding claim which is expected to be settled later at a higher figure or  otherwise effected, shall be prohibited.

Pending further coordination, Member States may require or permit the application  of the following methods where, because of the nature of the class or type of insurance in  question, information about premiums receivable, claims payable or both for the underwriting years  is insufficient when the annual accounts are drawn up for accurate estimates to be made. Method 1The excess of the premiums written over the claims and expenses paid in respect of  contracts commencing in the underwriting year shall form a technical provision which is included in  the technical provision for claims outstanding shown in the balance sheet in liabilities item C  (3). The provision may also be computed on the basis of a given percentage of the premiums written  where such a method is appropriate for the type of risk insured. Should the need arise, the amount  of this technical provision shall be increased to make it sufficient to meet present and future  obligations. The technical provision constituted by this method shall be replaced by a provision  for claims outstanding estimated in the usual manner as soon as sufficient information has been  gathered and not later than the end of the third year following the underwriting year. Method 2The figures shown in the technical account or in certain items within it shall relate to a  year which wholly or partly precedes the financial year. It must not do so by more than 12 months.  The amounts of the technical provisions shown in the annual accounts shall if necessary be  increased to make them sufficient to meet present and future obligations. 2.  Where one of the methods described in paragraph 1 is adopted, it shall be applied  systematically in successive years unless circumstances justify a change. The use of either method  shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts and the reasons given; in the event of a change in  the method applied, the effect on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss  shall be indicated in the notes on the accounts.
