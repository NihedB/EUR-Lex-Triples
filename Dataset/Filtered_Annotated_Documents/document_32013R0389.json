{"celex_id": "32013R0389", "reference": "3.5.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 122/1\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 389/2013\nof 2 May 2013\nestablishing a Union Registry pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Decisions No 280/2004/EC and No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Regulations (EU) No 920/2010 and No 1193/2011\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,\nHaving regard to Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 concerning a mechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the Kyoto Protocol (2), and in particular the first subparagraph, second sentence, Article 6(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community's greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020 (3), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,\nHaving consulted the European Data Protection Supervisor,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe registries system ensures the accurate accounting of transactions under the Union emissions trading scheme (ETS) set up by Directive 2003/87/EC, the Kyoto Protocol and Decision No 406/2009/EC. Registries are standardised and secured electronic databases containing common data elements to track the issue, holding, transfer and cancellation of the relevant units, to provide for public access and confidentiality as appropriate and to ensure that there are no transfers which are incompatible with the obligations resulting from Directive 2003/87/EC, the Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Kyoto Protocol) and Decision No 406/2009/EC.\n(2)\nArticle 19(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC requires that all allowances issued from 1 January 2012 onwards are held in a Union Registry on accounts managed by the Member States. Commission Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 of 7 October 2010 for a standardised and secured system of registries pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) provided for such a Union Registry.\n(3)\nDirective 2003/87/EC has been substantially amended by Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community (5), requiring major changes to the registries system. The amendments apply from the trading period starting in 2013. At present, there is no international agreement replacing the Kyoto Protocol in force that would apply to Member States after 2012. Aviation allowances were auctioned from 2012 on the basis of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 of 12 November 2010 on the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC (6), in the same way as general allowances. Therefore, Commission Regulation (EU) No 1193/2011 of 18 November 2011 establishing a Union Registry for the trading period commencing on 1 January 2013, and subsequent trading periods, of the Union emissions trading scheme pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulations (EC) No 2216/2004 and (EU) No 920/2010 (7) was adopted pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/87/EC and applies to the trading period of the Union emissions trading scheme commencing on 1 January 2013 and to subsequent periods. It also applies to aviation allowances auctioned in 2012.\n(4)\nIn order to ensure that Kyoto units and allowances can be held on the same Union Registry accounts, the Union Registry must conform to the functional and technical specifications for data exchange standards for registry systems under the Kyoto Protocol, adopted by Decision 12/CMP.1 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (Decision 12/CMP.1).\n(5)\nArticle 20 of Directive 2003/87/EC requires that an independent transaction log, the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL) is established to record the issue, transfer and cancellation of allowances. Article 6(2) of Decision No 280/2004/EC requires that information on the issue, holding, transfer, acquisition, cancellation and withdrawal of assigned amount units, removal units, emission reduction units and certified emission reductions and the carryover of assigned amount units, emission reduction units and certified emission reductions is made available to the transaction log.\n(6)\nThe Union Registry should contain the accounts in which the processes and operations needed to apply the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC should be registered. Each account should be created in accordance with standardised procedures to ensure the integrity of the registries system and public access to information held in this system. Allowances should be issued in the Union Registry.\n(7)\nTransactions with allowances within the Union Registry should be carried out through a communication link involving the EUTL, whereas transactions with Kyoto units should be carried out through a communication link involving both the EUTL and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) International Transaction Log (ITL).\n(8)\nAs allowances and Kyoto units exist only in dematerialised form and are fungible, the title to an allowance or Kyoto unit should be established by their existence in the account of the Union Registry in which they are held. Moreover, to reduce the risks associated with the reversal of transactions entered in a registry, and the consequent disruption to the system and to the market that such reversal may cause, it is necessary to ensure that allowances and Kyoto units are fully fungible. In particular, transactions cannot be reversed, revoked or unwound, other than as defined by the rules of the registry, after a moment set out by those rules. Nothing in this Regulation should prevent an account holder or a third party from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction that they may have in law to recovery or restitution in respect of a transaction that has entered a system, such as in case of fraud or technical error, as long as this does not lead to the reversal, revocation or unwinding of the transaction. Furthermore, the acquisition of an allowance or Kyoto unit in good faith should be protected.\n(9)\nThe central administrator's main responsibilities are to provide, operate and maintain the Union Registry and the EUTL, to manage central accounts and to perform operations which are carried out centrally. The national administrators' main responsibilities are to be the contact point with their respective account holders in the Union Registry and perform all operations involving direct contact with them, including the opening, suspension and closure of accounts.\n(10)\nWhere Member States allocate allowances free of charge on the basis of Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC, these allowances should be issued in accordance with Article 10c of that Directive and Commission Decisions adopted pursuant to it. To this end, the relevant national allocation tables should take into account the applications pursuant to Article 10c(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC of Member States concerned as well as the relevant Commission Decisions pursuant to Article 10c(6) of that Directive.\n(11)\nWhere a Member State, taking into account its application pursuant to Article 10c(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC and the relevant Commission Decision pursuant to Article 10c(6) of that Directive, delays the issuance of the allowances to be granted free of charge on the basis of Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC (ex-post issuance of allowances), that Member State should include in its national allocation table pursuant to Article 51(1) of this Regulation the allocation to be granted free of charge on the basis of investments already undertaken or financial transfers already made at the time of the notification of the table.\n(12)\nWhere a Member State, taking into account its application pursuant to Article 10c(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC and the relevant Commission Decision pursuant to Article 10c(6) of that Directive, issues the allowances to be granted free of charge on the basis of Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC irrespective of investments already undertaken (ex-ante issuance of allowances), the Member State should include in the national allocation table the allocation to be granted free of charge in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC for the period 2013 to 2019, when notifying the national allocation table to the Commission pursuant to Article 51(1) of this Regulation.\n(13)\nBased on the reports to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to Article 10c(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, Member States should make changes to the national allocation tables to reflect the advancement of investments undertaken and the status of financial transfers made in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC and corresponding Commission decisions respectively.\n(14)\nArticle 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC provides that competent authorities are to issue by 28 February of each year allowances that are to be allocated that year. Where an operator has submitted information pursuant to Article 24 of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU of 27 April 2011 determining transitional Union-wide rules for harmonised free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) that affects the number of allowances to be allocated to that operator, the allocation of the operator will need to be recalculated and notified pursuant to Article 24(2) of that Decision before a transfer of the allowances to the operator can occur pursuant to Article 53(2) of this Regulation.\n(15)\nNothing in this Regulation should prevent a competent authority from requiring an operator to transfer a number of allowances, received in excess of its adjusted allocation for the relevant year, to the EU Allocation Account in cases where there has been an over allocation of allowances, including as a result of an error in the original allocation or the operator having failed to correctly or completely submit to the competent authority information pursuant to Article 24 of Decision 2011/278/EU by the date set out in that Article, provided that the central administrator has made a change to the national allocation table of the Member State pursuant to Article 52(2) of this Regulation to adjust the allocation accordingly.\n(16)\nArticle 11b of Directive 2003/87/EC forbids the issuance of certified emissions reductions (CERs) and emission reduction units (ERUs) after 31 December 2012 that result in double counting of greenhouse gas emission reductions. However, Article 5(2) of Commission Decision 2006/780/EC of 13 November 2006 on avoiding double counting of greenhouse gas emission reductions under the Community emissions trading scheme for project activities under the Kyoto Protocol pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) allows allowances in the set-asides established pursuant to Article 3 of that Decision to be converted into assigned amount units (AAUs) or to be sold as 2008-2012 period allowances. Moreover, Member States should be able to issue until 30 April 2013 ERUs from projects involving activities only included in the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC from 1 January 2013 in respect of emission reductions which took place until 31 December 2012.\n(17)\nThe Union, the Member States and a number of third countries have taken economy-wide reduction commitments for emissions during the period 2008-2012. Member States have legally binding economy-wide emission reduction targets from 2013 to 2020, as established in Directive 2003/87/EC and Decision No 406/2009/EC. An amendment of the Kyoto Protocol should put in place internationally legally binding quantified emission targets from 2013 to 2020 for parties listed in its Annex B once it has entered into force for those parties. Decision 13/CMP.1 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (Decision 13/CMP.1) requires that ERUs only be issued by converting AAUs or removal units (RMUs), which have a serial number comprising the commitment period for which they are issued. ERUs cannot be issued if the commitment period marked in the relevant serial number does not match the period during which the emissions reductions took place. Emission trading scheme (ETS) accounts in the Union Registry should not hold ERUs inconsistent with these rules. To this end, ERUs issued by third countries which do not have legally binding quantified emission targets from 2013 to 2020 as set out within an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol pursuant to its Article 3, paragraph 9, or that have not deposited an instrument of ratification relating to such an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, should only be held in the Union Registry if they have been certified to relate to emission reductions verified as having taken place before 2013. Such ERUs transferred to the Union Registry after 1st May 2013 are expected to be issued pursuant to the verification procedure under the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee set out in Decision 9/CMP.1 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (Decision 9/CMP.1) (pursuant to the so-called ‘track 2 procedure’).\n(18)\nArticle 11a of Directive 2003/87/EC provides for the use of CERs and ERUs from project activities before the entry into force of an international agreement on climate change, by setting up the possibility for operators to exchange such units against allowances.\n(19)\nThird countries or their sub-federal or regional entities should be able to open accounts in the Union Registry once modalities to link the ETS to another mandatory greenhouse gas emissions trading system with an absolute emission cap have been agreed with a third country.\n(20)\nArticle 11 of Decision No 406/2009/EC provides that the accurate accounting of transactions under that Decision be ensured in the registries system.\n(21)\nAnnual emission allocation units should be issued in the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) Compliance Accounts in the Union Registry in the quantities determined pursuant to Article 3(2) and 10 of Decision No 406/2009/EC. Annual emission allocation units (AEAs) may only be held in in the ESD Compliance Accounts in the Union Registry.\n(22)\nThe Union Registry should enable the implementation of the annual compliance cycle under Decision No 406/2009/EC by providing the processes for the introduction in the ESD Compliance Accounts of the annual reviewed greenhouse gas emissions, for the determination of the compliance status figure for each Member State's ESD Compliance Account for each year and for the application of corrective action pursuant to Article 7 of Decision No 406/2009/EC if necessary.\n(23)\nThe Union Registry should ensure the accurate accounting of transactions provided by Article 3(3), (4), and (5) and Article 5 of Decision No 406/2009/EC.\n(24)\nThe EUTL should perform automated checks on all processes in the registries system concerning allowances, verified emissions, accounts, annual emission allocation units, the credit entitlement and Kyoto units, and the ITL should perform automated checks on processes concerning Kyoto units to ensure that there are no irregularities. Processes that fail these checks should be terminated in order to ensure that transactions in the Union registries system comply with the requirements of Directive 2003/87/EC, Decision No 406/2009/EC and the requirements elaborated pursuant to the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.\n(25)\nAdequate and harmonised requirements on opening of accounts, authentication and access rights should be applied to protect the security of information held in the integrated registries system and to avoid fraud. The review of these requirements should be considered in the future with a view to ensuring their effectiveness while taking into account proportionality. Records concerning all processes, operators and persons in the registries system should be kept.\n(26)\nThe central administrator should ensure that interruptions to the operation of the registries system are kept to a minimum by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the availability of the Union Registry and the EUTL and by providing for robust systems and procedures to safeguard relevant information.\n(27)\nSince it may be desirable to provide for additional account types or other means that would facilitate the holding of allowances or Kyoto units on behalf of third parties, or the taking of a security interest in them, these issues should be examined in the context of a future review of this Regulation.\n(28)\nIn accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC (10) and Decision 13/CMP.1, specific reports should be made public on a regular basis to ensure that the public has access to information held within the integrated system of registries, subject to certain confidentiality requirements.\n(29)\nNational administrators, the central administrator and the Commission should comply with Union and national legislation concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (11) and the national law implementing it, and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (12), where these are applicable to information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation for which they are the controllers.\n(30)\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 of 7 October 2010 for a standardised and secured system of registries pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should apply until all operations required in relation to the trading period between 2008 and 2012 are completed. It should be amended to provide for the replacement of aviation allowances held by users at the end of the trading period between 2008 and 2012 by aviation allowances valid for the trading period starting in 2013, with immediate effect. Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 should therefore be repealed with effect from 1 October 2013.\n(31)\nRegulation (EU) No 1193/2011 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a Regulation including the provisions required by Directive 2003/87/EC, Decision No 280/2004/EC and Decision No 406/2009/EC with immediate effect.\n(32)\nRegulation (EU) 1193/2011 provided deadlines for the terms of cooperation between the central administrator and national administrators to be agreed and for the notification of national allocation tables and national aviation allocation tables. While Regulation (EU) 1193/2011 is repealed, those obligations should be maintained.\n(33)\nIt is appropriate that this Regulation enters into force as a matter of urgency.\n(34)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nCOMMON GENERAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nSubject matter, scope and definitions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down general, operational and maintenance requirements concerning the Union Registry for the trading period commencing on 1 January 2013 and subsequent periods, concerning the independent transaction log provided for in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, and concerning registries provided for in Article 6 of Decision No 280/2004/EC.\nThis Regulation also provides for a communication system between the Union Registry and the ITL.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation applies to allowances created for the trading period of the Union emissions trading scheme commencing on 1 January 2013 and subsequent periods, annual emission allocation units and Kyoto units.\nThis Regulation also applies to aviation allowances to be auctioned that were created for the trading period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nUnless otherwise indicated, terms used in Title II of this Regulation have the same meaning as under Directive 2003/87/EC.

A Union Registry for the trading period of the Union emissions trading scheme commencing on 1 January 2013 and subsequent periods is established.\n2.   The central administrator shall operate and maintain the Union Registry, including its technical infrastructure.\n3.   Member States shall use the Union Registry for the purposes of meeting their obligations under Article 19 of Directive 2003/87/EC and Article 11 of Decision No 406/2009/EC and to ensure accurate accounting of allowances, AEAs and to the credit entitlement within the scope of this Regulation. The Union Registry shall provide national administrators and account holders with the processes set out in this Regulation.\n4.   The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry conforms to the functional and technical specifications for data exchange standards for registry systems under the Kyoto Protocol elaborated pursuant to Decision 12/CMP.1 and have regard to the hardware, network, software and security requirements set out in the data exchange and technical specifications provided for in Article 105 of this Regulation.\nArticle 5\nNational and Union KP registries\n1.   For the purposes of meeting their obligations as Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and under Article 6 of Decision No 280/2004/EC to ensure the accurate accounting of Kyoto units, each Member State and the Union shall operate a Kyoto Protocol registry (KP registry) in the form of a standardised electronic database that have regard to the UNFCCC's requirements concerning registries, and in particular the functional and technical specifications for data exchange standards for registry systems under the Kyoto Protocol elaborated pursuant to Decision 12/CMP.1, and to the hardware, network, software and security requirements set out in the data exchange and technical specifications provided for in Article 105 of this Regulation.\n2.   The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry also function as a KP registry for the Union as a Party to the Kyoto Protocol. The central administrator shall also act as the administrator of the Union's KP registry, which is part of the Union registry.\nArticle 6\nEuropean Union transaction log\n1.   A European Union Transaction Log (EUTL), to take the form of a standardised electronic database, is established, pursuant to Article 20 of Directive 2003/87/EC, for transactions within the scope of this Regulation. The EUTL shall also serve to record all information relating to the holdings and transfers of Kyoto units made available in accordance with Article 6(2) of Decision No 280/2004/EC.\n2.   The central administrator shall operate and maintain the EUTL in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.\n3.   The central administrator shall ensure that the EUTL is capable of checking and recording all processes referred to under this Regulation, and has regard to the functional and technical specifications for data exchange standards for registry systems under the Kyoto Protocol elaborated pursuant to Decision 12/CMP.1 and complies with the hardware, network and software requirements set out in the data exchange and technical specifications provided for in Article 105 of this Regulation.\n4.   The central administrator shall ensure that the EUTL is capable of recording all processes described in Chapters 3 of Title I and Titles II, III and IV.\nArticle 7\nCommunication links between registries, the ITL and the EUTL\n1.   The central administrator and Member States shall ensure that the Union Registry and KP registries maintain a communication link with the ITL for the purposes of communicating transactions with Kyoto units.\n2.   The central administrator shall ensure that the EUTL maintains a communication link with the ITL for the purposes of recording and checking transfers referred to in paragraph 1. All proposed transfers involving a KP registry shall be processed and checked by the EUTL before the transfer is recorded.\n3.   The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry maintains a direct communication link with the EUTL for the purposes of checking and recording transactions with allowances, AEAs or portions of the credit entitlements and the account management processes set out in Chapter 3 of Title I. All transactions involving allowances, AEAs or portions of the credit entitlement shall take place within the Union Registry, and shall be recorded and checked by the EUTL. The central administrator may establish a restricted communication link between the EUTL and the registry of a third country which signed a treaty concerning its accession to the Union for the purposes of enabling such registries to communicate with the ITL through the EUTL and to record verified emissions data of operators in the EUTL. Those registries must successfully complete all testing and initialisation procedures required of registries before the establishment of this communication link.\nArticle 8\nNational administrators and KP registry administrators\n1.   Each Member State shall designate a national administrator. Notwithstanding Article 13(2), the Member State shall access and administer pursuant to Article 11 its own accounts and the accounts in the Union Registry under its jurisdiction through its national administrator as defined in Annex I. Each Member State's national administrator shall also act as the administrator of its KP registry in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.\n2.   The Member States and the Commission shall ensure that there is no conflict of interest amongst national administrators, the central administrator and account holders.\n3.   Each Member State shall notify the Commission of the identity and contact details of its national administrator, including an emergency telephone number to be used in the case of a security incident.\n4.   The Commission shall coordinate the implementation of this Regulation with the national administrators of each Member State and the central administrator. In particular, the Commission shall consult the Administrators' Working Group of the Climate Change Committee on issues and procedures related to the operation of registries regulated under this Regulation and the implementation of this Regulation. By 31 March 2012, the Administrators' Working Group shall agree on the terms of cooperation between the central administrator and the national administrators that shall include common operational procedures for the implementation of this Regulation and change and incident management procedures for the Union registry and technical specifications for the functioning and reliability of the Union registry and the EUTL.

However, it continues to apply until 31 December 2025 to, among other things, all operations required in relation to the trading period between 2013 and 2020, and notably for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) until the period for fulfilling commitments (true-up period) in 2023.\nKEY POINTS\nEU emissions trading system\nThe EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU’s policy to combat climate change and its key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. It is the world’s first major carbon market and remains the biggest. The EU ETS works on the ‘cap and trade’ principle. A cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by installations covered by the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall.\nWithin the cap, companies receive or buy emission allowances which they can trade with one another as needed. In the third phase of the ETS (2013–2020) the companies could also buy limited amounts of international credits from emission-saving projects around the world. The limit on the total number of allowances available ensures that they have a value.\nBy the end of April each year, installations and aircraft operators covered by the EU ETS must surrender enough allowances to cover all their emissions in the previous year, or risk heavy fines. If a company reduces its emissions, it can keep its spare allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another company that is short of allowances.\nUnion Registry\nThe regulation sets up, from 1 January 2013, an EU-wide Union Registry, an online database that holds accounts for stationary installations, aircraft operators (included in the EU ETS since January 2012) and for any person interested in trading emission allowances.\nAuctioning is the default method for allocating allowances, rather than free allocation. Harmonised allocation rules apply to those allowances that are still freely allocated.\nThe registry records:\nlists of installations and aircraft operators covered by the ETS directive (Directive 2003/87/EC) in each EU Member State and any free allocation to each of them;\naccounts of companies or individuals holding emission allowances;\ntransfers of allowances (‘transactions’) carried out by account holders;\nannual verified CO2 emissions from installations and aircraft operators;\nthe annual reconciliation of allowances and verified emissions, where each company must have surrendered enough allowances to cover all its verified emissions.\nOpening an account\nTo participate in the EU ETS, companies or individuals have to open an account in the Union Registry, sending a request to the national administrator, who collects and checks all supporting documentation.\nEU Transaction Log\nThe EU Transaction Log (EUTL) automatically checks, records and authorises all transactions between accounts in the Union Registry, ensuring that all transfers comply with EU ETS rules.\nThe EUTL is the successor of the Community Independent Transaction Log, which had a similar role before the Union Registry was introduced.\nKyoto registries\nThe Union Registry also acts as a KP registry to assist the EU and its Member States in meeting their obligations as parties to the KP.\nAmendments\nAmending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/1844 outlines the implications and new procedures for the Union Registry and the national KP registries following the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, for consistent implementation of internationally agreed accounting requirements.\nRegulations (EU) 2018/208 and 2019/401 introduced the possibility to protect the integrity of the EU ETS in the case of Brexit.\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1122, which will replace this Regulation from 1 January 2021, sets out the possibility of linking with the registries of other greenhouse gas emissions trading systems.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) No 389/2013 has been repealed by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122 fromf 1 January 2021, although it continues to apply until 31 December 2025 to, among other things, all operations required in relation to the trading period between 2013 and 2020 and notably for the second commitment period of the KP.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 4 May 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nKyoto 2nd commitment period (2013–2020) (European Commission)\nParis Agreement (European Commission)\nEU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) (European Commission)\nUnion Registry (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 of 2 May 2013 establishing a Union Registry pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Decisions No 280/2004/EC and No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Regulations (EU) No 920/2010 and No 1193/2011 (OJ L 122, 3.5.2013, pp. 1–59).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 have been incorporated into the original document.
