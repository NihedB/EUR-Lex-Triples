{"celex_id": "32014R0598", "reference": "12.6.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 173/65\nREGULATION (EU) No 598/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 April 2014\non the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a Balanced Approach and repealing Directive 2002/30/EC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA key objective of the common transport policy is sustainable development. This requires an integrated approach aimed at ensuring both the effective functioning of Union transport systems and protection of the environment.\n(2)\nSustainable development of air transport requires the introduction of measures aimed at reducing the noise impact from aircraft at Union airports. Those measures should improve the noise environment around Union airports in order to maintain or increase the quality of life of neighbouring citizens and foster compatibility between aviation activities and residential areas, in particular where night flights are concerned.\n(3)\nResolution A33/7 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) introduces the concept of a ‘Balanced Approach’ to noise management (Balanced Approach) and establishes a coherent method to address aircraft noise. The Balanced Approach should remain the foundation of noise regulation for aviation as a global industry. The Balanced Approach recognises the value of, and does not prejudge, relevant legal obligations, existing agreements, current laws and established policies. Incorporating the international rules of the Balanced Approach in this Regulation should substantially lessen the risk of international disputes in the event of third-country carriers being affected by noise-related operating restrictions.\n(4)\nFollowing the removal of the noisiest aircraft pursuant to Directive 2002/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Directive 2006/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), an update of how to use operating restriction measures is required to enable authorities to deal with the current noisiest aircraft so as to improve the noise environment around Union airports within the international framework of the Balanced Approach.\n(5)\nThe report from the Commission of 15 February 2008 entitled ‘Noise Operation Restrictions at EU Airports’ pointed to the need to clarify in the text of Directive 2002/30/EC the allocation of responsibilities and the precise rights and obligations of interested parties during the noise assessment process so as to guarantee that cost-effective measures are taken to achieve the noise abatement objectives for each airport.\n(6)\nThe introduction of operating restrictions by Member States at Union airports on a case-by-case basis, whilst limiting capacity, can contribute to improving the noise climate around airports. However, there is a possibility of distorting competition or hampering the overall efficiency of the Union aviation network through the inefficient use of existing capacity. Since the achievement of the specific noise abatement objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of harmonised rules on the process for introducing operating restrictions as part of the noise management process, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. Such a harmonised method does not impose noise quality objectives, which continue to derive from Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), other relevant Union rules or legislation within each Member State, and does not prejudge the concrete selection of measures.\n(7)\nThis Regulation should only apply to Member States in which an airport with more than 50 000 civil aircraft movements per calendar year is located and when the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions is being considered at such an airport.\n(8)\nThis Regulation should apply to aircraft engaged in civil aviation. It should not apply to aircraft such as military aircraft and aircraft undertaking customs, police and fire-fighting operations. Furthermore, various operations of an exceptional nature, such as flights for urgent humanitarian reasons, search and rescue in emergency situations, medical assistance, and disaster relief, should be exempted from this Regulation.\n(9)\nWhile noise assessments should be carried out on a regular basis in accordance with Directive 2002/49/EC, such assessments should only lead to additional noise abatement measures if the current combination of noise mitigating measures does not achieve the noise abatement objectives, taking into account expected airport development. For airports where a noise problem has been identified, additional noise abatement measures should be identified in accordance with the Balanced Approach methodology. In order to ensure a wide application of the Balanced Approach within the Union, its use is recommended whenever it is considered adequate by the individual Member State concerned, even beyond the scope of this Regulation. Noise-related operating restrictions should be introduced only when other Balanced Approach measures are not sufficient to attain the specific noise abatement objectives.\n(10)\nWhile a cost-benefit analysis provides an indication of the total economic welfare effects by comparing all costs and benefits, a cost-effectiveness assessment focuses on achieving a given objective in the most cost-effective way, requiring a comparison of only the costs. This Regulation should not prevent Member States from using cost-benefit analyses where appropriate.\n(11)\nThe importance of health aspects needs to be recognised in relation to noise problems, and it is therefore important that those aspects be taken into consideration in a consistent manner at all airports when a decision is taken on noise abatement objectives, taking into account the existence of common Union rules in this area. Therefore, health aspects should be assessed in accordance with Union legislation on the evaluation of noise effects.\n(12)\nNoise assessments should be based on objective and measurable criteria common to all Member States and should build on existing information available, such as information arising from the implementation of Directive 2002/49/EC. Member States should ensure that such information is reliable, that it is obtained in a transparent manner and that it is accessible to competent authorities and stakeholders. Competent authorities should put in place the necessary monitoring tools.\n(13)\nThe competent authority responsible for adopting noise-related operating restrictions should be independent of any organisation involved in the airport’s operation, air transport or air navigation service provision, or representing the interests thereof and of the residents living in the vicinity of the airport. This should not be understood as requiring Member States to modify their administrative structures or decision-making procedures.\n(14)\nIt is recognised that Member States have decided on noise-related operating restrictions in accordance with national legislation based on nationally acknowledged noise methods, which, as yet, might not be fully consistent with the method described in the authoritative European Civil Aviation Conference Report Doc 29 entitled ‘Standard Method of Computing Noise Contours around Civil Airports’ (ECAC Doc 29) nor use the internationally recognised aircraft noise performance information. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of a noise-related operating restriction should be assessed in accordance with the methods prescribed in ECAC Doc 29 and the Balanced Approach. Accordingly, Member States should adapt their assessments of operating restrictions in national legislation towards full compliance with ECAC Doc 29.\n(15)\nA new and wider definition of operating restrictions as compared to Directive 2002/30/EC should be introduced in order to facilitate the implementation of new technologies and new operational capabilities of aircraft and ground equipment. Its application should not lead to delay in the implementation of operational measures which could immediately alleviate the noise impact without substantially affecting the operational capacity of an airport. Such measures should therefore not be considered to constitute new operating restrictions.\n(16)\nThe centralisation of information on noise would substantially reduce the administrative burden for both aircraft operators and airport operators. Such information is currently provided and managed at the level of individual airports. Those data need to be placed at the disposal of aircraft operators and airports for operational purposes. It is important to use the databank of the European Aviation Safety Agency (‘the Agency’) concerning noise performance certification as a validation tool with the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) data on individual flights. Such data are currently already systematically requested for central flow management purposes, but are not at present available to the Commission or to the Agency, and need to be specified for the purpose of this Regulation and for performance regulation of air traffic management. Good access to validated modelling data, determined in accordance with internationally recognised processes and best practices, should improve the quality of mapping of noise contours of individual airports to support policy decisions.\n(17)\nTo avoid unwanted consequences for aviation safety, airport capacity and competition, the Commission should notify the relevant competent authority if it finds that the process followed for the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions does not meet the requirements of this Regulation. The relevant competent authority should examine the Commission notification and should inform the Commission of its intentions before introducing the operating restrictions.\n(18)\nIn order to take account of the Balanced Approach, provision should be made for the possibility of exemptions in special circumstances for operators from developing third countries, without which such operators would suffer undue hardship. Reference to ‘developing countries’ is to be understood in the light of this specific aviation context and does not include all countries that would otherwise be referred to as such, within the international community. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that any such exemptions are compatible with the principle of non-discrimination.\n(19)\nIn order to reflect the continuous technological progress in engine and airframe technologies and the methods used to map noise contours, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission with respect to regularly updating the noise standards for aircraft referred to in this Regulation and the reference to the associated certification methods, taking into account, when appropriate, changes in relevant ICAO documents and updating the reference to the method for computing noise contours, taking into account, when appropriate, changes in relevant ICAO documents. In addition, changes to ECAC Doc 29 should also be taken into consideration for technical updates through delegated acts, as appropriate. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of all relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(20)\nWhile this Regulation requires a regular assessment of the noise situation at airports, such an assessment does not necessarily entail the adoption of new noise-related operating restrictions or the review of existing ones. Therefore, this Regulation does not require the review of noise-related operating restrictions already in place at the date of its entry into force, including those resulting from court decisions or local mediation processes. Minor technical amendments to measures without substantive implications for capacity or operations should not be considered as new noise-related operating restrictions.\n(21)\nWhere the consultation process preceding the adoption of a noise-related operating restriction was launched under Directive 2002/30/EC and is still ongoing at the date of entry into force of this Regulation, it is appropriate to allow the final decision to be taken in accordance with Directive 2002/30/EC in order to preserve the progress already achieved in that process.\n(22)\nConsidering the need for the consistent application of the noise assessment method within the Union aviation market, this Regulation sets out common rules in the field of noise operating restrictions.\n(23)\nDirective 2002/30/EC should therefore be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter, objectives and scope\n1.   This Regulation lays down, where a noise problem has been identified, rules on the process to be followed for the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions in a consistent manner on an airport-by-airport basis, so as to help improve the noise climate and to limit or reduce the number of people significantly affected by potentially harmful effects of aircraft noise, in accordance with the Balanced Approach.\n2.   The objectives of this Regulation are:\n(a)\nto facilitate the achievement of specific noise abatement objectives, including health aspects, at the level of individual airports, while respecting relevant Union rules, in particular those laid down in Directive 2002/49/EC, and the legislation within each Member State;\n(b)\nto enable the use of operating restrictions in accordance with the Balanced Approach so as to achieve the sustainable development of the airport and air traffic management network capacity from a gate-to-gate perspective.\n3.   This Regulation shall apply to aircraft engaged in civil aviation. It shall not apply to aircraft engaged in military, customs, police or similar operations.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘aircraft’ means fixed-wing aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass of 34 000 kg or more, or with a certificated maximum internal accommodation for the aircraft type in question consisting of 19 passenger seats or more, excluding any seats for crew only;\n(2)\n‘airport’ means an airport which has more than 50 000 civil aircraft movements per calendar year (a movement being a take-off or landing), on the basis of the average number of movements in the last three calendar years before the noise assessment;\n(3)\n‘Balanced Approach’ means the process developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization under which the range of available measures, namely the reduction of aircraft noise at source, land-use planning and management, noise abatement operational procedures and operating restrictions, is considered in a consistent way with a view to addressing the noise problem in the most cost-effective way on an airport-by-airport basis;\n(4)\n‘marginally compliant aircraft’ means aircraft which are certified in accordance with limits laid down in Volume 1, Part II, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed on 7 December 1944 (the Chicago Convention) by a cumulative margin of less than 8 EPNdB (Effective Perceived Noise in Decibels) during a transitional period ending on 14 June 2020, and by a cumulative margin of less than 10 EPNdB following the end of that transitional period, whereby the cumulative margin is the figure expressed in EPNdB obtained by adding the individual margins (i.e. the differences between the certificated noise level and the maximum permitted noise level) at each of the three reference noise measurement points defined in Volume 1, Part II, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention;\n(5)\n‘noise-related action’ means any measure that affects the noise climate around airports, for which the principles of the Balanced Approach apply, including other non-operational actions that can affect the number of people exposed to aircraft noise;\n(6)\n‘operating restriction’ means a noise-related action that limits access to or reduces the operational capacity of an airport, including operating restrictions aimed at the withdrawal from operations of marginally compliant aircraft at specific airports as well as operating restrictions of a partial nature, which for example apply for an identified period of time during the day or only for certain runways at the airport.\nArticle 3\nCompetent authorities\n1.   A Member State in which an airport as referred to in point (2) of Article 2 is located shall designate one or more competent authorities responsible for the process to be followed when adopting operating restrictions.\n2.   The competent authorities shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action. That independence may be achieved through a functional separation.\n3.   The Member States shall notify the Commission, in a timely manner, of the names and addresses of the designated competent authorities referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission shall publish that information.\nArticle 4\nRight of appeal\n1.   Member States shall ensure the right to appeal against operating restrictions adopted pursuant to this Regulation before an appeal body other than the authority that adopted the contested restriction, in accordance with national legislation and procedures.\n2.   The Member State in which an airport as referred to in point (2) of Article 2 is located shall notify the Commission, in a timely manner, of the name and address of the designated appeal body referred to in paragraph 1 or, where appropriate, of the arrangements for ensuring that an appeal body is appointed.\nArticle 5\nGeneral rules on aircraft noise management\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the noise situation at an individual airport as referred to in point (2) of Article 2 is assessed in accordance with Directive 2002/49/EC.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the Balanced Approach is adopted in respect of aircraft noise management at those airports where a noise problem has been identified. To that end, they shall ensure that:\n(a)\nthe noise abatement objective for that airport, taking into account, as appropriate, Article 8 of, and Annex V to, Directive 2002/49/EC, is defined;\n(b)\nmeasures available to reduce the noise impact are identified;\n(c)\nthe likely cost-effectiveness of the noise mitigation measures is thoroughly evaluated;\n(d)\nthe measures, taking into account public interest in the field of air transport as regards the development prospects of their airports, are selected without detriment to safety;\n(e)\nthe stakeholders are consulted in a transparent way on the intended actions;\n(f)\nthe measures are adopted and sufficient notification is provided for;\n(g)\nthe measures are implemented; and\n(h)\ndispute resolution is provided for.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that, when noise-related action is taken, the following combination of available measures is considered, with a view to determining the most cost-effective measure or combination of measures:\n(a)\nthe foreseeable effect of a reduction of aircraft noise at source;\n(b)\nland-use planning and management;\n(c)\nnoise abatement operational procedures;\n(d)\nnot applying operating restrictions as a first resort, but only after consideration of the other measures of the Balanced Approach.\nThe available measures may if necessary include the withdrawal of marginally compliant aircraft. Member States, or airport managing bodies, as appropriate, may offer economic incentives to encourage aircraft operators to use less noisy aircraft during the transitional period referred to in point (4) of Article 2. Those economic incentives shall comply with the applicable rules on State aid.\n4.   The measures may, within the Balanced Approach, be differentiated according to aircraft type, aircraft noise performance, use of airport and air navigation facilities, flight path and/or the timeframe covered.\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4, operating restrictions which take the form of the withdrawal of marginally compliant aircraft from airport operations shall not affect civil subsonic aircraft that comply, through either original certification or re-certification, with the noise standard laid down in Volume 1, Part II, Chapter 4 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention.\n6.   Measures or a combination of measures taken in accordance with this Regulation for a given airport shall not be more restrictive than is necessary in order to achieve the environmental noise abatement objectives set for that airport. Operating restrictions shall be non-discriminatory, in particular on grounds of nationality or identity, and shall not be arbitrary.\nArticle 6\nRules on noise assessment\n1.   The competent authorities shall ensure that the noise situation at airports for which they are responsible is assessed on a regular basis, in accordance with Directive 2002/49/EC and the legislation applicable within each Member State. The competent authorities may call on the support of the Performance Review Body referred to in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 691/2010 (7).\n2.   If the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 indicates that new operating restriction measures may be required to address a noise problem at an airport, the competent authorities shall ensure that:\n(a)\nthe method, indicators and information in Annex I are applied in such a way as to take due account of the contribution of each type of measure under the Balanced Approach, before operating restrictions are introduced;\n(b)\nat the appropriate level, technical cooperation is established between the airport operators, aircraft operators and air navigation service providers to examine measures to mitigate noise. The competent authorities shall also ensure that local residents, or their representatives, and relevant local authorities are consulted, and that technical information on noise mitigation measures is provided to them;\n(c)\nthe cost-effectiveness of any new operating restriction is assessed, in accordance with Annex II. Minor technical amendments to measures without substantive implications on capacity or operations shall not be considered new operating restrictions;\n(d)\nthe process of consultation with interested parties, which may take the form of a mediation process, is organised in a timely and substantive manner, ensuring openness and transparency as regards data and computation methodologies. Interested parties shall have at least three months prior to the adoption of the new operating restrictions to submit comments. The interested parties shall include at least:\n(i)\nlocal residents living in the vicinity of the airport and affected by air traffic noise, or their representatives, and the relevant local authorities;\n(ii)\nrepresentatives of local businesses based in the vicinity of the airport, whose activities are affected by air traffic and the operation of the airport;\n(iii)\nrelevant airport operators;\n(iv)\nrepresentatives of those aircraft operators which may be affected by noise-related actions;\n(v)\nthe relevant air navigation service providers;\n(vi)\nthe Network Manager, as defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 677/2011 (8);\n(vii)\nwhere applicable, the designated slots coordinator.\n3.   The competent authorities shall follow up and monitor the implementation of the operating restrictions and take action as appropriate. They shall ensure that relevant information is made available free of charge and that it is readily and promptly accessible to local residents living in the vicinity of the airports and to the relevant local authorities.\n4.   The relevant information may include:\n(a)\nwhile respecting national law, information on alleged infringements due to changes in flight procedures, in terms of their impact and the reasons why such changes were made;\n(b)\nthe general criteria applied when distributing and managing traffic in each airport, to the extent that those criteria may have an environmental or noise impact; and\n(c)\ndata collected by noise measuring systems, if available.\nArticle 7\nNoise performance information\n1.   Decisions on noise-related operating restrictions shall be based on the noise performance of the aircraft as determined by the certification procedure conducted in accordance with Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention, sixth edition of March 2011.\n2.   At the request of the Commission, aircraft operators shall communicate the following noise information in respect of the aircraft that they operate at Union airports:\n(a)\nthe aircraft nationality and registration mark;\n(b)\nthe noise documentation of the aircraft used, together with the associated maximum take-off weight;\n(c)\nany modification of the aircraft which affects its noise performance and is stated on the noise documentation.\n3.   Upon request of the Agency, holders of an aircraft type certificate or a supplemental type certificate issued in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), and legal or natural persons operating aircraft for which no type certificate has been issued under that Regulation, shall provide aircraft noise and performance information for noise modelling purposes. The Agency shall specify the data required and the timeframe for, and the form and manner of, its provision. The Agency shall verify the received aircraft noise and performance information for modelling purposes and shall make the information available to other parties for noise modelling purposes.\n4.   The data referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall be limited to what is strictly necessary and shall be provided free of charge, in electronic form and using the format specified, where applicable.\n5.   The Agency shall verify the aircraft noise and performance data for modelling purposes in relation to its tasks performed in accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n6.   Data shall be stored in a central database and made available to competent authorities, aircraft operators, air navigation service providers and airport operators for operational purposes.\nArticle 8\nRules on the introduction of operating restrictions\n1.   Before introducing an operating restriction, the competent authorities shall give to the Member States, the Commission and the relevant interested parties six months’ notice, ending at least two months prior to the determination of the slot coordination parameters as defined in point (m) of Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 (10) for the airport concerned for the relevant scheduling period.\n2.   Following the assessment carried out in accordance with Article 6, the notification shall be accompanied by a written report in accordance with the requirements specified in Article 5 explaining the reasons for introducing the operating restriction, the noise abatement objective established for the airport, the measures that were considered to meet that objective, and the evaluation of the likely cost-effectiveness of the various measures considered, including, where relevant, their cross-border impact.\n3.   At the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, the Commission may, within a period of three months after the day on which it receives notice under paragraph 1, review the process for the introduction of an operating restriction. Where the Commission finds that the introduction of a noise-related operating restriction does not follow the process set out in this Regulation, it may notify the relevant competent authority accordingly. The relevant competent authority shall examine the Commission notification and inform the Commission of its intentions before introducing the operating restriction.\n4.   Where the operating restriction concerns the withdrawal of marginally compliant aircraft from an airport, no additional services above the number of movements with marginally compliant aircraft in the corresponding period of the previous year shall be allowed at that airport six months after the notification referred to in paragraph 1. The Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities decide on the annual rate for reducing the number of movements of marginally compliant aircraft of affected operators at that airport, taking due account of the age of the aircraft and the composition of the total fleet. Without prejudice to Article 5(4), that rate shall not be more than 25 % of the number of movements of marginally compliant aircraft for each operator serving that airport.\nArticle 9\nDeveloping countries\n1.   In order to avoid undue economic hardship, the competent authorities may exempt marginally compliant aircraft registered in developing countries from noise operating restrictions, while fully respecting the principle of non-discrimination, provided that such aircraft:\n(a)\nare granted a noise certification to the standards specified in Chapter 3, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention;\n(b)\nwere operated in the Union during the five-year period preceding the entry into force of this Regulation;\n(c)\nwere on the register of the developing country concerned in that five-year period; and\n(d)\ncontinue to be operated by a natural or legal person established in that country.\n2.   Where a Member State grants an exemption provided for in paragraph 1, it shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission thereof.\nArticle 10\nExemption for aircraft operations of an exceptional nature\nThe competent authorities may, on a case-by-case basis, authorise individual operations at airports for which they are responsible in respect of marginally compliant aircraft which could not otherwise take place on the basis of this Regulation.\nThe exemption shall be limited to:\n(a)\noperations which are of such an exceptional nature that it would be unreasonable to withhold a temporary exemption, including humanitarian aid flights; or\n(b)\nnon-revenue flights for the purpose of alterations, repair or maintenance.\nArticle 11\nDelegated acts\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 12 concerning:\n(a)\ntechnical updates to the noise certification standards provided for in Article 5(5) and point (a) of Article 9(1), and to the certification procedure provided for in Article 7(1);\n(b)\ntechnical updates to the methodology and indicators set out in Annex I.\nThe purpose of those updates shall be to take into account changes to relevant international rules, as appropriate.\nArticle 12\nExercise of the delegation\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.   The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 11 shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 13 June 2016. The Commission shall draw up a report in respect of the delegation of power not later than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than three months before the end of each period.\n3.   The delegation of power referred to in Article 11 may be revoked by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the powers specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\n4.   As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n5.   A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 11 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\nArticle 13\nInformation and revision\nMember States shall upon request submit information on the application of this Regulation to the Commission.\nNo later than 14 June 2021, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of this Regulation.\nThat report shall be accompanied, where necessary, by proposals for revision of this Regulation.\nArticle 14\nExisting operating restrictions\nNoise-related operating restrictions which were already introduced before 13 June 2016 shall remain in force until the competent authorities decide to revise them in accordance with this Regulation.\nArticle 15\nRepeal\nDirective 2002/30/EC is repealed with effect from 13 June 2016.\nArticle 16\nTransitional provisions\nNotwithstanding Article 15 of this Regulation, noise-related operating restrictions adopted after 13 June 2016 may be adopted in accordance with Directive 2002/30/EC where the consultation process prior to their adoption was ongoing at that date and provided that those restrictions are adopted at the latest one year after that date.\nArticle 17\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 13 June 2016.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 16 April 2014.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.

The rules are based on the principles of the Balanced approach to noise management agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United Nations' body dealing with international civil aviation.\nAn operating restriction can take various forms, like setting a noise or a movement limit, introducing a non-addition rule (no additional movements or operations in general, or from a specific type of aircraft) or adopting a curfew for a period of night.\nScope\nThe rules apply only to larger airports with more than 50 000 civil aircraft movements per year. They cover civilian aircraft but exclude military, customs and police movements. The setting of specific noise thresholds, however, remains the preserve of national and local authorities.\nCompetent authorities\nEU countries each appoint competent authorities which take charge of the procedures to be followed for the adoption of operating restrictions. These must be independent of any party that might have a conflict of interest.\nRight of review\nBefore introducing operating restrictions, competent authorities have to give 6 months' notice to the other Member States, the European Commission and interested parties. The Commission may, within 3 months of receiving the notice, examine the case. If it considers the procedures do not respect the rules, it notifies the competent authority which must, in turn, inform it of the action it intends to take.\nHealth aspects\nEU legislation regarding the impacts of noise on human health (Directive 2002/49/EC) must be taken into account when any decision is taken on noise reduction objectives.\nNoise performance information\nDecisions on operating restrictions must be taken based on individual aircraft noise performance data provided by the operators. This information will be centralised in a database and made available to competent authorities, airlines, air navigation service providers, airports and airport users.\nAssessment of noise and information for residents\nCompetent authorities must ensure the regular monitoring of noise levels at airports for which they are responsible. If from their evaluation it emerges that operation restrictions could be a cost-effective measure to mitigate noise, a consultation process needs to be organised rapidly and interested parties have 3 months to submit their views before the adoption of restrictions.\nAuthorities must also ensure that information on operating restrictions is promptly and freely available to local residents and local authorities.\nPhasing-out of noisy aircraft\nNoise mitigation measures may include the withdrawal of, or extra restrictions upon, the noisier aircraft among those permitted by ICAO rules. Authorities will decide on the annual rate for reducing the number of movements by such aircraft for each operator at a given airport, up to a maximum of 25 %.\nRegulation (EU) No 598/2014 repeals Directive 2002/30/EC with effect from 13 June 2016.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU) No 598/2014\n13.6.2016\n-\nOJ L 173 of 12.6.2014\nRELATED ACTS\nDirective 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (Official Journal L 189 of 18 July 2002).\nLast updated: 01.08.2014", "tags": ["airport", "noise level", "noise protection", "aircraft"], "subjects": ["Transport", "Environment"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {"32014R0598_p1": {"text": "regulation 598/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 16 April 2014---on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a Balanced Approach and repealing directive 2002/30/ec", "triples": [" regulation 598/2014,  repealing,  directive 2002/30/ec"]}, "32014R0598_p2": {"text": "(7)  Commission regulation 691/2010 of 29 July 2010 laying down a performance scheme for air navigation services and network functions and amending regulation 2096/2005 laying down common requirements for the provision of air navigation services (OJ L 201, 3.8.2010, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 691/2010,  amending,  regulation 2096/2005"]}, "32014R0598_p3": {"text": "(8)  Commission regulation 677/2011 of 7 July 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of air traffic management (ATM) network functions and amending regulation 691/2010 (OJ L 185, 15.7.2011, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 677/2011,  amending,  regulation 691/2010"]}, "32014R0598_p4": {"text": "(9)  regulation 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council directive 91/670/eec, regulation 1592/2002 and directive 2004/36/ec (OJ L 79, 19.3.2008, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 216/2008,  repealing,  directive 91/670/eec", " regulation 216/2008,  repealing,  regulation 1592/2002", " regulation 216/2008,  repealing,  directive 2004/36/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32014R0598_p1": {"text": "regulation 598/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a balanced approach and repealing directive 2002/30/ec.", "triples": [" regulation 598/2014,  repealing,  directive 2002/30/ec"]}, "32014R0598_p2": {"text": "regulation 598/2014 repeals directive 2002/30/ec with effect from 13 June 2016.", "triples": [" regulation 598/2014,  repeals,  directive 2002/30/ec"]}}}
