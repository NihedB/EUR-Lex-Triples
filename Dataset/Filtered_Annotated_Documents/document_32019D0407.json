Both the Convention and the Fish Stocks Agreement require all States to cooperate in conserving and managing the living resources of the sea. The Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean (‘the Agreement’) fulfils this obligation.\n(3)\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) provides that the Union is to conduct its external fisheries relations in accordance with its international obligations and policy objectives, as well as the objectives and principles set out in Articles 2 and 3 of that Regulation, in order to ensure sustainable exploitation, management and conservation of marine biological resources and the marine environment. The Agreement is consistent with those objectives.\n(4)\nOn 31 March 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an international agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. Those negotiations were successfully concluded on 30 November 2017. In accordance with Council Decision (EU) 2018/1257 (5), the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean was signed on 3 October 2018, subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n(5)\nBecoming a party to the Agreement will promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine biological resources globally, and is therefore in the Union's interest.\n(6)\nThe Agreement should be approved,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean (‘the Agreement’) is hereby approved on behalf of the Union.\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the Union, the instruments of approval provided for in Article 15 of the Agreement.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nDone at Brussels, 4 March 2019.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.

It includes the Arctic Ocean and the territories of 8 Arctic countries: Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.\nThe Agreement was signed by Canada, China, Denmark (in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland), the European Union, Iceland, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Russia and the United States.\nThe agreement is precautionary — until recently, ice has covered the high seas portion of the Central Arctic Ocean all year round, making fishing in those waters impossible. However, global warming has significantly reduced ice coverage, which may open up this area to fishing in the future.\nThe agreement is based on the principles set out in United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Agreement for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.\nScope\nThe agreement covers fish, molluscs and crustaceans — except those belonging to sedentary species as defined in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nThe parties agree not to engage in commercial fishing activities in the high seas portion of the Central Arctic Ocean for an initial period of 16 years after the agreement enters into force. This period can be extended automatically every 5 years, unless one party objects.\nJoint programme of scientific research and monitoring\nThe agreement will establish a joint programme of scientific research and monitoring to improve the understanding of the ecosystems of the Central Arctic Ocean and, in particular, to determine whether there might be fish stocks in this area that could be harvested sustainably.\nConservation and management measures\nThe parties can only authorise vessels registered in their country to carry out commercial fishing if they follow:\ninternationally recognised conservation and management measures for the sustainable management of fish stocks adopted by one or more regional or subregional fisheries management organisation(s) or arrangement(s); or\ninterim conservation and management measures that may be established by the parties.\nReview and further implementation\nA review of the agreement and of the scientific information obtained through the joint programme will take place at least every 2 years.\nConservation and management measures for exploratory fishing in the area will be established within 3 years of the Agreement coming into force.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement will enter into force when all 10 signatories have ratified it.\nThe decision entered into force on 18 March 2019.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean (OJ L 73, 15.3.2019, pp. 3-8)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2019/407 of 4 March 2019 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean (OJ L 73, 15.3.2019, pp. 1-2)\nlast update 14.08.2019", "tags": ["conservation of fish stocks", "agreement (EU)", "Arctic Ocean", "deep-sea fishing", "fishing agreement", "ratification of an agreement", "fishing area", "fishing controls", "fishing rights", "international waters"], "subjects": ["External relations", "Fisheries policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32019D0407_p1": {"text": "(4)  regulation 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council regulation 1954/2003 regulation 1224/2009 and repealing Council regulation 2371/2002 regulation 639/2004 and Council decision 2004/585/ec (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 22).", "triples": [" regulation 1380/2013,  amending,  regulation 1954/2003", " regulation 1380/2013,  amending,  regulation 1224/2009", " regulation 1380/2013,  repealing,  regulation 2371/2002", " regulation 1380/2013,  repealing,  regulation 639/2004", " regulation 1380/2013,  repealing,  decision 2004/585/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
