{"celex_id": "32013R0603", "reference": "29.6.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 180/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 603/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 June 2013\non the establishment of ‧Eurodac‧ for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person and on requests for the comparison with Eurodac data by Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes, and amending Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 78 (2)(e), 87(2)(a) and 88(2)(a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA number of substantive changes are to be made to Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 of 11 December 2000 concerning the establishment of ‧Eurodac‧ for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (3) and to Council Regulation (EC) No 407/2002 of 28 February 2002 laying down certain rules to implement Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 concerning the establishment of \"Eurodac\" for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (4). In the interest of clarity, those Regulations should be recast.\n(2)\nA common policy on asylum, including a Common European Asylum System, is a constituent part of the European Union's objective of progressively establishing an area of freedom, security and justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, seek international protection in the Union.\n(3)\nThe European Council of 4 November 2004 adopted The Hague Programme which set the objectives to be implemented in the area of freedom, security and justice in the period 2005-2010. The European Pact on Immigration and Asylum endorsed by the European Council of 15-16 October 2008 called for the completion of the establishment of a Common European Asylum System by creating a single procedure comprising common guarantees and a uniform status for refugees and for persons eligible for subsidiary protection.\n(4)\nFor the purposes of applying Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person (5), it is necessary to establish the identity of applicants for international protection and of persons apprehended in connection with the unlawful crossing of the external borders of the Union. It is also desirable, in order effectively to apply Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, and in particular Article 18(1)(b) and (d) thereof, to allow each Member State to check whether a third-country national or stateless person found illegally staying on its territory has applied for international protection in another Member State.\n(5)\nFingerprints constitute an important element in establishing the exact identity of such persons. It is necessary to set up a system for the comparison of their fingerprint data.\n(6)\nTo that end, it is necessary to set up a system known as ‧Eurodac‧, consisting of a Central System, which will operate a computerised central database of fingerprint data, as well as of the electronic means of transmission between the Member States and the Central System, hereinafter the \"Communication Infrastructure\".\n(7)\nThe Hague Programme called for the improvement of access to existing data filing systems in the Union. In addition, The Stockholm Programme called for well targeted data collection and a development of information exchange and its tools that is driven by law enforcement needs.\n(8)\nIt is essential in the fight against terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences for the law enforcement authorities to have the fullest and most up-to-date information if they are to perform their tasks. The information contained in Eurodac is necessary for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences as referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism (6) or of other serious criminal offences as referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (7). Therefore, the data in Eurodac should be available, subject to the conditions set out in this Regulation, for comparison by the designated authorities of Member States and the European Police Office (Europol).\n(9)\nThe powers granted to law enforcement authorities to access Eurodac should be without prejudice to the right of an applicant for international protection to have his or her application processed in due course in accordance with the relevant law. Furthermore, any subsequent follow-up after obtaining a ‧hit‧ from Eurodac should also be without prejudice to that right.\n(10)\nThe Commission outlines in its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 24 November 2005 on improved effectiveness, enhanced interoperability and synergies among European databases in the area of Justice and Home Affairs that authorities responsible for internal security could have access to Eurodac in well defined cases, when there is a substantiated suspicion that the perpetrator of a terrorist or other serious criminal offence has applied for international protection. In that Communication the Commission also found that the proportionality principle requires that Eurodac be queried for such purposes only if there is an overriding public security concern, that is, if the act committed by the criminal or terrorist to be identified is so reprehensible that it justifies querying a database that registers persons with a clean criminal record, and it concluded that the threshold for authorities responsible for internal security to query Eurodac must therefore always be significantly higher than the threshold for querying criminal databases.\n(11)\nMoreover, Europol plays a key role with respect to cooperation between Member States' authorities in the field of cross-border crime investigation in supporting Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigation. Consequently, Europol should also have access to Eurodac within the framework of its tasks and in accordance with Council Decision 2009/371/JHA of 6 April 2009 establishing the European Police Office (Europol) (8).\n(12)\nRequests for comparison of Eurodac data by Europol should be allowed only in specific cases, under specific circumstances and under strict conditions.\n(13)\nSince Eurodac was originally established to facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention, access to Eurodac for the purposes of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences constitutes a change of the original purpose of Eurodac, which interferes with the fundamental right to respect for the private life of individuals whose personal data are processed in Eurodac. Any such interference must be in accordance with the law, which must be formulated with sufficient precision to allow individuals to adjust their conduct and it must protect individuals against arbitrariness and indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise. Any interference must be necessary in a democratic society to protect a legitimate and proportionate interest and proportionate to the legitimate objective it aims to achieve.\n(14)\nEven though the original purpose of the establishment of Eurodac did not require the facility of requesting comparisons of data with the database on the basis of a latent fingerprint, which is the dactyloscopic trace which may be found at a crime scene, such a facility is fundamental in the field of police cooperation. The possibility to compare a latent fingerprint with the fingerprint data which is stored in Eurodac in cases where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the perpetrator or victim may fall under one of the categories covered by this Regulation will provide the designated authorities of the Member States with a very valuable tool in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, when for example the only evidence available at a crime scene are latent fingerprints.\n(15)\nThis Regulation also lays down the conditions under which requests for comparison of fingerprint data with Eurodac data for the purposes of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences should be allowed and the necessary safeguards to ensure the protection of the fundamental right to respect for the private life of individuals whose personal data are processed in Eurodac. The strictness of those conditions reflects the fact that the Eurodac database registers fingerprint data of persons who are not presumed to have committed a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence.\n(16)\nWith a view to ensuring equal treatment for all applicants and beneficiaries of international protection, as well as in order to ensure consistency with the current Union asylum acquis, in particular with Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted (9) and Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, it is appropriate to extend the scope of this Regulation in order to include applicants for subsidiary protection and persons eligible for subsidiary protection.\n(17)\nIt is also necessary to require the Member States promptly to take and transmit the fingerprint data of every applicant for international protection and of every third-country national or stateless person who is apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border of a Member State, if they are at least 14 years of age.\n(18)\nIt is necessary to lay down precise rules for the transmission of such fingerprint data to the Central System, the recording of such fingerprint data and of other relevant data in the Central System, their storage, their comparison with other fingerprint data, the transmission of the results of such comparison and the marking and erasure of the recorded data. Such rules may be different for, and should be specifically adapted to, the situation of different categories of third-country nationals or stateless persons.\n(19)\nMember States should ensure the transmission of fingerprint data of an appropriate quality for the purpose of comparison by means of the computerised fingerprint recognition system. All authorities with a right of access to Eurodac should invest in adequate training and in the necessary technological equipment. The authorities with a right of access to Eurodac should inform the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice established by Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) (the \"Agency\") of specific difficulties encountered with regard to the quality of data, in order to resolve them.\n(20)\nThe fact that it is temporarily or permanently impossible to take and/or to transmit fingerprint data, due to reasons such as insufficient quality of the data for appropriate comparison, technical problems, reasons linked to the protection of health or due to the data subject being unfit or unable to have his or her fingerprints taken owing to circumstances beyond his or her control, should not adversely affect the examination of or the decision on the application for international protection lodged by that person.\n(21)\nHits obtained from Eurodac should be verified by a trained fingerprint expert in order to ensure the accurate determination of responsibility under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 and the exact identification of the criminal suspect or victim of crime whose data might be stored in Eurodac.\n(22)\nThird-country nationals or stateless persons who have requested international protection in one Member State may have the option of requesting international protection in another Member State for many years to come. Therefore, the maximum period during which fingerprint data should be kept by the Central System should be of considerable length. Given that most third-country nationals or stateless persons who have stayed in the Union for several years will have obtained a settled status or even citizenship of a Member State after that period, a period of ten years should be considered a reasonable period for the storage of fingerprint data.\n(23)\nThe storage period should be shorter in certain special situations where there is no need to keep fingerprint data for that length of time. Fingerprint data should be erased immediately once third-country nationals or stateless persons obtain citizenship of a Member State.\n(24)\nIt is appropriate to store data relating to those data subjects whose fingerprints were initially recorded in Eurodac upon lodging their applications for international protection and who have been granted international protection in a Member State in order to allow data recorded upon lodging an application for international protection to be compared against them.\n(25)\nThe Agency has been entrusted with the Commission's tasks relating to the operational management of Eurodac in accordance with this Regulation and with certain tasks relating to the Communication Infrastructure as from the date on which the Agency took up its responsibilities on 1 December 2012. The Agency should take up the tasks entrusted to it under this Regulation, and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 should be amended accordingly. In addition, Europol should have observer status at the meetings of the Management Board of the Agency when a question in relation to the application of this Regulation concerning access for consultation of Eurodac by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences is on the agenda. Europol should be able to appoint a representative to the Eurodac Advisory Group of the Agency.\n(26)\nThe Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union (Staff Regulations of Officials) and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union (‧Conditions of Employment‧), laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 of the Council (11) (together referred to as the ‧Staff Regulations‧) should apply to all staff working in the Agency on matters pertaining to this Regulation.\n(27)\nIt is necessary to lay down clearly the respective responsibilities of the Commission and the Agency, in respect of the Central System and the Communication Infrastructure, and of the Member States, as regards data processing, data security, access to, and correction of, recorded data.\n(28)\nIt is necessary to designate the competent authorities of the Member States as well as the National Access Point through which the requests for comparison with Eurodac data are made and to keep a list of the operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request such comparison for the specific purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences.\n(29)\nRequests for comparison with data stored in the Central System should be made by the operating units within the designated authorities to the National Access Point, through the verifying authority and should be reasoned. The operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request comparisons with Eurodac data should not act as a verifying authority. The verifying authorities should act independently of the designated authorities and should be responsible for ensuring, in an independent manner, strict compliance with the conditions for access as established in this Regulation. The verifying authorities should then forward the request, without forwarding the reasons for it, for comparison through the National Access Point to the Central System following verification that all conditions for access are fulfilled. In exceptional cases of urgency where early access is necessary to respond to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, the verifying authority should process the request immediately and only carry out the verification afterwards.\n(30)\nThe designated authority and the verifying authority may be part of the same organisation, if permitted under national law, but the verifying authority should act independently when performing its tasks under this Regulation.\n(31)\nFor the purposes of protection of personal data, and to exclude systematic comparisons which should be forbidden, the processing of Eurodac data should only take place in specific cases and when it is necessary for the purposes of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences. A specific case exists in particular when the request for comparison is connected to a specific and concrete situation or to a specific and concrete danger associated with a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence, or to specific persons in respect of whom there are serious grounds for believing that they will commit or have committed any such offence. A specific case also exists when the request for comparison is connected to a person who is the victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence. The designated authorities and Europol should thus only request a comparison with Eurodac when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such a comparison will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence.\n(32)\nIn addition, access should be allowed only on condition that comparisons with the national fingerprint databases of the Member State and with the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Council Decision 2008/615/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime (12) did not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject. That condition requires the requesting Member State to conduct comparisons with the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Decision 2008/615/JHA which are technically available, unless that Member State can justify that there are reasonable grounds to believe that it would not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject. Such reasonable grounds exist in particular where the specific case does not present any operational or investigative link to a given Member State. That condition requires prior legal and technical implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA by the requesting Member State in the area of fingerprint data, as it should not be permitted to conduct a Eurodac check for law enforcement purposes where those above steps have not been first taken.\n(33)\nPrior to searching Eurodac, designated authorities should also, provided that the conditions for a comparison are met, consult the Visa Information System under Council Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences (13).\n(34)\nFor the purpose of efficient comparison and exchange of personal data, Member States should fully implement and make use of the existing international agreements as well as of Union law concerning the exchange of personal data already in force, in particular of Decision 2008/615/JHA.\n(35)\nThe best interests of the child should be a primary consideration for Member States when applying this Regulation. Where the requesting Member State establishes that Eurodac data pertain to a minor, these data may only be used for law enforcement purposes by the requesting Member State in accordance with that State's laws applicable to minors and in accordance with the obligation to give primary consideration to the best interests of the child.\n(36)\nWhile the non-contractual liability of the Union in connection with the operation of the Eurodac system will be governed by the relevant provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), it is necessary to lay down specific rules for the non-contractual liability of the Member States in connection with the operation of the system.\n(37)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of a system for the comparison of fingerprint data to assist the implementation of Union asylum policy, cannot, by its very nature, be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(38)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (14) applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States carried out in application of this Regulation unless such processing is carried out by the designated or verifying authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences.\n(39)\nThe processing of personal data by the authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences pursuant to this Regulation should be subject to a standard of protection of personal data under their national law which complies with Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters (15).\n(40)\nThe principles set out in Directive 95/46/EC regarding the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably their right to privacy, with regard to the processing of personal data should be supplemented or clarified, in particular as far as certain sectors are concerned.\n(41)\nTransfers of personal data obtained by a Member State or Europol pursuant to this Regulation from the Central System to any third country or international organisation or private entity established in or outside the Union should be prohibited, in order to ensure the right to asylum and to safeguard applicants for international protection from having their data disclosed to a third country. This implies that Member States should not transfer information obtained from the Central System concerning: the Member State(s) of origin; the place and date of application for international protection; the reference number used by the Member State of origin; the date on which the fingerprints were taken as well as the date on which the Member State(s) transmitted the data to Eurodac; the operator user ID; and any information relating to any transfer of the data subject under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013. That prohibition should be without prejudice to the right of Member States to transfer such data to third countries to which Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 applies, in order to ensure that Member States have the possibility of cooperating with such third countries for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(42)\nNational supervisory authorities should monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, and the supervisory authority set up by Decision 2009/371/JHA should monitor the lawfulness of data processing activities performed by Europol.\n(43)\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (16), and in particular Articles 21 and 22 thereof concerning confidentiality and security of processing, applies to the processing of personal data by Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies carried out in application of this Regulation. However, certain points should be clarified in respect of the responsibility for the processing of data and of the supervision of data protection, bearing in mind that data protection is a key factor in the successful operation of Eurodac and that data security, high technical quality and lawfulness of consultations are essential to ensure the smooth and proper functioning of Eurodac as well as to facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013.\n(44)\nThe data subject should be informed of the purpose for which his or her data will be processed within Eurodac, including a description of the aims of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, and of the use to which law enforcement authorities may put his or her data.\n(45)\nIt is appropriate that national supervisory authorities monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, whilst the European Data Protection Supervisor, as referred to in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, should monitor the activities of the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in relation to the processing of personal data carried out in application of this Regulation.\n(46)\nMember States, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should ensure that the national and European supervisory authorities are able to supervise the use of and access to Eurodac data adequately.\n(47)\nIt is appropriate to monitor and evaluate the performance of Eurodac at regular intervals, including in terms of whether law enforcement access has led to indirect discrimination against applicants for international protection, as raised in the Commission's evaluation of the compliance of this Regulation with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‧the Charter‧). The Agency should submit an annual report on the activities of the Central System to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(48)\nMember States should provide for a system of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to sanction the processing of data entered in the Central System contrary to the purpose of Eurodac.\n(49)\nIt is necessary that Member States be informed of the status of particular asylum procedures, with a view to facilitating the adequate application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013.\n(50)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter. In particular, this Regulation seeks to ensure full respect for the protection of personal data and for the right to seek international protection, and to promote the application of Articles 8 and 18 of the Charter. This Regulation should therefore be applied accordingly.\n(51)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(52)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, the United Kingdom has notified its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(53)\nIn accordance with Article 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(54)\nIt is appropriate to restrict the territorial scope of this Regulation so as to align it on the territorial scope of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nPurpose of \"Eurodac\"\n1.   A system known as \"Eurodac\" is hereby established, the purpose of which shall be to assist in determining which Member State is to be responsible pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 for examining an application for international protection lodged in a Member State by a third-country national or a stateless person, and otherwise to facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 under the conditions set out in this Regulation.\n2.   This Regulation also lays down the conditions under which Member States' designated authorities and the European Police Office (Europol) may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes.\n3.   Without prejudice to the processing of data intended for Eurodac by the Member State of origin in databases set up under the latter's national law, fingerprint data and other personal data may be processed in Eurodac only for the purposes set out in this Regulation and Article 34(1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.

Non-compliance with the 72-hour time-limit referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not relieve Member States of the obligation to take and transmit the fingerprints to the Central System. Where the condition of the fingertips does not allow the taking of fingerprints of a quality ensuring appropriate comparison under Article 25, the Member State of origin shall retake the fingerprints of persons apprehended as described in paragraph 1 of this Article, and resend them as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours after they have been successfully retaken.\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where it is not possible to take the fingerprints of the apprehended person on account of measures taken to ensure his or her health or the protection of public health, the Member State concerned shall take and send such fingerprints as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours after those health grounds no longer prevail.\nIn the event of serious technical problems, Member States may extend the 72-hour time-limit in paragraph 2 by a maximum of a further 48 hours in order to carry out their national continuity plans.\nArticle 15\nRecording of data\n1.   The data referred to in Article 14(2) shall be recorded in the Central System.\nWithout prejudice to Article 8, data transmitted to the Central System pursuant to Article 14(2) shall be recorded solely for the purposes of comparison with data on applicants for international protection subsequently transmitted to the Central System and for the purposes laid down in Article 1(2).\nThe Central System shall not compare data transmitted to it pursuant to Article 14(2) with any data previously recorded in the Central System, or with data subsequently transmitted to the Central System pursuant to Article 14(2).\n2.   As regards the comparison of data on applicants for international protection subsequently transmitted to the Central System with the data referred to in paragraph 1, the procedures provided for in Article 9(3) and (5) and in Article 25(4) shall apply.\nArticle 16\nStorage of data\n1.   Each set of data relating to a third-country national or stateless person as referred to in Article 14(1) shall be stored in the Central System for 18 months from the date on which his or her fingerprints were taken. Upon expiry of that period, the Central System shall automatically erase such data.\n2.   The data relating to a third-country national or stateless person as referred to in Article 14(1) shall be erased from the Central System in accordance with Article 28(3) as soon as the Member State of origin becomes aware of one of the following circumstances before the 18 month period referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article has expired:\n(a)\nthe third-country national or stateless person has been issued with a residence document;\n(b)\nthe third-country national or stateless person has left the territory of the Member States;\n(c)\nthe third-country national or stateless person has acquired the citizenship of any Member State.\n3.   The Central System shall, as soon as possible and no later than after 72 hours, inform all Member States of origin of the erasure of data for the reason specified in paragraph 2(a) or (b) of this Article by another Member State of origin having produced a hit with data which they transmitted relating to persons referred to in Article 14(1).\n4.   The Central System shall, as soon as possible and no later than after 72 hours, inform all Member States of origin of the erasure of data for the reason specified in paragraph 2(c) of this Article by another Member State of origin having produced a hit with data which they transmitted relating to persons referred to in Article 9(1) or 14(1).\nCHAPTER IV\nTHIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS OR STATELESS PERSONS FOUND ILLEGALLY STAYING IN A MEMBER STATE\nArticle 17\nComparison of fingerprint data\n1.   With a view to checking whether a third-country national or a stateless person found illegally staying within its territory has previously lodged an application for international protection in another Member State, a Member State may transmit to the Central System any fingerprint data relating to fingerprints which it may have taken of any such third-country national or stateless person of at least 14 years of age together with the reference number used by that Member State.\nAs a general rule there are grounds for checking whether the third-country national or stateless person has previously lodged an application for international protection in another Member State where:\n(a)\nthe third-country national or stateless person declares that he or she has lodged an application for international protection but without indicating the Member State in which he or she lodged the application;\n(b)\nthe third-country national or stateless person does not request international protection but objects to being returned to his or her country of origin by claiming that he or she would be in danger, or\n(c)\nthe third-country national or stateless person otherwise seeks to prevent his or her removal by refusing to cooperate in establishing his or her identity, in particular by showing no, or false, identity papers.\n2.   Where Member States take part in the procedure referred to in paragraph 1, they shall transmit to the Central System the fingerprint data relating to all or at least the index fingers and, if those are missing, the prints of all the other fingers, of third-country nationals or stateless persons referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   The fingerprint data of a third-country national or a stateless person as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be transmitted to the Central System solely for the purpose of comparison with the fingerprint data of applicants for international protection transmitted by other Member States and already recorded in the Central System.\nThe fingerprint data of such a third-country national or a stateless person shall not be recorded in the Central System, nor shall they be compared with the data transmitted to the Central System pursuant to Article 14(2).\n4.   Once the results of the comparison of fingerprint data have been transmitted to the Member State of origin, the record of the search shall be kept by the Central System only for the purposes of Article 28. Other than for those purposes, no other record of the search may be stored either by Member States or by the Central System.\n5.   As regards the comparison of fingerprint data transmitted under this Article with the fingerprint data of applicants for international protection transmitted by other Member States which have already been stored in the Central System, the procedures provided for in Article 9(3) and (5) and in Article 25(4) shall apply.\nCHAPTER V\nBENEFICIARIES OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\nArticle 18\nMarking of data\n1.   For the purposes laid down in Article 1(1), the Member State of origin which granted international protection to an applicant for international protection whose data were previously recorded in the Central System pursuant to Article 11 shall mark the relevant data in conformity with the requirements for electronic communication with the Central System established by the Agency. That mark shall be stored in the Central System in accordance with Article 12 for the purpose of transmission under Article 9(5). The Central System shall inform all Member States of origin of the marking of data by another Member State of origin having produced a hit with data which they transmitted relating to persons referred to in Article 9(1) or 14(1). Those Member States of origin shall also mark the corresponding data sets.\n2.   The data of beneficiaries of international protection stored in the Central System and marked pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made available for comparison for the purposes laid down in Article 1(2) for a period of three years after the date on which the data subject was granted international protection.\nWhere there is a hit, the Central System shall transmit the data referred to in Article 11(a) to (k) for all the data sets corresponding to the hit. The Central System shall not transmit the mark referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. Upon the expiry of the period of three years, the Central System shall automatically block such data from being transmitted in the event of a request for comparison for the purposes laid down in Article 1(2), whilst leaving those data available for comparison for the purposes laid down in Article 1(1) until the point of their erasure. Blocked data shall not be transmitted, and the Central System shall return a negative result to the requesting Member State in the event of a hit.\n3.   The Member State of origin shall unmark or unblock data concerning a third-country national or stateless person whose data were previously marked or blocked in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2 of this Article if his or her status is revoked or ended or the renewal of his or her status is refused under Articles 14 or 19 of Directive 2011/95/EU.\nCHAPTER VI\nPROCEDURE FOR COMPARISON AND DATA TRANSMISSION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES\nArticle 19\nProcedure for comparison of fingerprint data with Eurodac data\n1.   For the purposes laid down in Article 1(2), the designated authorities referred to in Articles 5(1) and 7(2) may submit a reasoned electronic request as provided for in Article 20(1) together with the reference number used by them, to the verifying authority for the transmission for comparison of fingerprint data to the Central System via the National Access Point. Upon receipt of such a request, the verifying authority shall verify whether all the conditions for requesting a comparison referred to in Articles 20 or 21, as appropriate, are fulfilled.\n2.   Where all the conditions for requesting a comparison referred to in Articles 20 or 21 are fulfilled, the verifying authority shall transmit the request for comparison to the National Access Point which will process it to the Central System in accordance with Article 9(3) and (5) for the purpose of comparison with the data transmitted to the Central System pursuant to Articles 9(1) and 14(2).\n3.   In exceptional cases of urgency where there is a need to prevent an imminent danger associated with a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence, the verifying authority may transmit the fingerprint data to the National Access Point for comparison immediately upon receipt of a request by a designated authority and only verify ex-post whether all the conditions for requesting a comparison referred to in Article 20 or Article 21 are fulfilled, including whether an exceptional case of urgency actually existed. The ex-post verification shall take place without undue delay after the processing of the request.\n4.   Where an ex-post verification determines that the access to Eurodac data was not justified, all the authorities that have accessed such data shall erase the information communicated from Eurodac and shall inform the verifying authority of such erasure.\nArticle 20\nConditions for access to Eurodac by designated authorities\n1.   For the purposes laid down in Article 1(2), designated authorities may submit a reasoned electronic request for the comparison of fingerprint data with the data stored in the Central System within the scope of their powers only if comparisons with the following databases did not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject:\n—\nnational fingerprint databases;\n—\nthe automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Decision 2008/615/JHA where comparisons are technically available, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that a comparison with such systems would not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject. Such reasonable grounds shall be included in the reasoned electronic request for comparison with Eurodac data sent by the designated authority to the verifying authority; and\n—\nthe Visa Information System provided that the conditions for such a comparison laid down in Decision 2008/633/JHA are met;\nand where the following cumulative conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe comparison is necessary for the purpose of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences, which means that there is an overriding public security concern which makes the searching of the database proportionate;\n(b)\nthe comparison is necessary in a specific case (i.e. systematic comparisons shall not be carried out); and\n(c)\nthere are reasonable grounds to consider that the comparison will substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of any of the criminal offences in question. Such reasonable grounds exist in particular where there is a substantiated suspicion that the suspect, perpetrator or victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence falls in a category covered by this Regulation.\n2.   Requests for comparison with Eurodac data shall be limited to searching with fingerprint data.\nArticle 21\nConditions for access to Eurodac by Europol\n1.   For the purposes laid down in Article 1(2), Europol's designated authority may submit a reasoned electronic request for the comparison of fingerprint data with the data stored in the Central System within the limits of Europol's mandate and where necessary for the performance of Europol's tasks only if comparisons with fingerprint data stored in any information processing systems that are technically and legally accessible by Europol did not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject and where the following cumulative conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe comparison is necessary to support and strengthen action by Member States in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences falling under Europol's mandate, which means that there is an overriding public security concern which makes the searching of the database proportionate;\n(b)\nthe comparison is necessary in a specific case (i.e. systematic comparisons shall not be carried out); and\n(c)\nthere are reasonable grounds to consider that the comparison will substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of any of the criminal offences in question. Such reasonable grounds exist in particular where there is a substantiated suspicion that the suspect, perpetrator or victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence falls in a category covered by this Regulation.\n2.   Requests for comparison with Eurodac data shall be limited to comparisons of fingerprint data.\n3.   Processing of information obtained by Europol from comparison with Eurodac data shall be subject to the authorisation of the Member State of origin. Such authorisation shall be obtained via the Europol national unit of that Member State.\nArticle 22\nCommunication between the designated authorities, the verifying authorities and the National Access Points\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 26, all communication between the designated authorities, the verifying authorities and the National Access Points shall be secure and take place electronically.\n2.   For the purposes laid down in Article 1(2), fingerprints shall be digitally processed by the Member States and transmitted in the data format referred to in Annex I, in order to ensure that the comparison can be carried out by means of the computerised fingerprint recognition system.\nCHAPTER VII\nDATA PROCESSING, DATA PROTECTION AND LIABILITY\nArticle 23\nResponsibility for data processing\n1.   The Member State of origin shall be responsible for ensuring that:\n(a)\nfingerprints are taken lawfully;\n(b)\nfingerprint data and the other data referred to in Article 11, Article 14(2) and Article 17(2) are lawfully transmitted to the Central System;\n(c)\ndata are accurate and up-to-date when they are transmitted to the Central System;\n(d)\nwithout prejudice to the responsibilities of the Agency, data in the Central System are lawfully recorded, stored, corrected and erased;\n(e)\nthe results of fingerprint data comparisons transmitted by the Central System are lawfully processed.\n2.   In accordance with Article 34, the Member State of origin shall ensure the security of the data referred to in paragraph 1 before and during transmission to the Central System as well as the security of the data it receives from the Central System.\n3.   The Member State of origin shall be responsible for the final identification of the data pursuant to Article 25(4).\n4.   The Agency shall ensure that the Central System is operated in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation. In particular, the Agency shall:\n(a)\nadopt measures ensuring that persons working with the Central System process the data recorded therein only in accordance with the purposes of Eurodac as laid down in Article 1;\n(b)\ntake the necessary measures to ensure the security of the Central System in accordance with Article 34;\n(c)\nensure that only persons authorised to work with the Central System have access thereto, without prejudice to the competences of the European Data Protection Supervisor.\nThe Agency shall inform the European Parliament and the Council as well as the European Data Protection Supervisor of the measures it takes pursuant to the first subparagraph.\nArticle 24\nTransmission\n1.   Fingerprints shall be digitally processed and transmitted in the data format referred to in Annex I.

As far as necessary for the efficient operation of the Central System, the Agency shall establish the technical requirements to ensure that data can be properly electronically transmitted from the Member States to the Central System and vice versa.\n3.   The reference number referred to in Articles 11(d), 14(2)(d), 17(1) and 19(1) shall make it possible to relate data unambiguously to one particular person and to the Member State which is transmitting the data. In addition, it shall make it possible to tell whether such data relate to a person referred to in Article 9(1), 14(1) or 17(1).\n4.   The reference number shall begin with the identification letter or letters by which, in accordance with the norm referred to in Annex I, the Member State transmitting the data is identified. The identification letter or letters shall be followed by the identification of the category of person or request. \"1\" refers to data relating to persons referred to in Article 9(1), \"2\" to persons referred to in Article 14(1), \"3\" to persons referred to in Article 17(1), \"4\" to requests referred to in Article 20, \"5\" to requests referred to in Article 21 and \"9\" to requests referred to in Article 29.\n5.   The Agency shall establish the technical procedures necessary for Member States to ensure receipt of unambiguous data by the Central System.\n6   The Central System shall confirm receipt of the transmitted data as soon as possible. To that end, the Agency shall establish the necessary technical requirements to ensure that Member States receive the confirmation receipt if requested.\nArticle 25\nCarrying out comparisons and transmitting results\n1.   Member States shall ensure the transmission of fingerprint data of an appropriate quality for the purpose of comparison by means of the computerised fingerprint recognition system. As far as necessary to ensure that the results of the comparison by the Central System reach a very high level of accuracy, the Agency shall define the appropriate quality of transmitted fingerprint data. The Central System shall, as soon as possible, check the quality of the fingerprint data transmitted. If fingerprint data do not lend themselves to comparison using the computerised fingerprint recognition system, the Central System shall inform the Member State concerned. That Member State shall then transmit fingerprint data of the appropriate quality using the same reference number as the previous set of fingerprint data.\n2.   The Central System shall carry out comparisons in the order of arrival of requests. Each request shall be dealt with within 24 hours. A Member State may for reasons connected with national law require particularly urgent comparisons to be carried out within one hour. Where such time-limits cannot be respected owing to circumstances which are outside the Agency's responsibility, the Central System shall process the request as a matter of priority as soon as those circumstances no longer prevail. In such cases, as far as is necessary for the efficient operation of the Central System, the Agency shall establish criteria to ensure the priority handling of requests.\n3.   As far as necessary for the efficient operation of the Central System, the Agency shall establish the operational procedures for the processing of the data received and for transmitting the result of the comparison.\n4.   The result of the comparison shall be immediately checked in the receiving Member State by a fingerprint expert as defined in accordance with its national rules, specifically trained in the types of fingerprint comparisons provided for in this Regulation. For the purposes laid down in Article 1(1) of this Regulation, final identification shall be made by the Member State of origin in cooperation with the other Member States concerned, pursuant to Article 34 of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013.\nInformation received from the Central System relating to other data found to be unreliable shall be erased as soon as the unreliability of the data is established.\n5.   Where final identification in accordance with paragraph 4 reveals that the result of the comparison received from the Central System does not correspond to the fingerprint data sent for comparison, Member States shall immediately erase the result of the comparison and communicate this fact as soon as possible and no later than after three working days to the Commission and to the Agency.\nArticle 26\nCommunication between Member States and the Central System\nData transmitted from the Member States to the Central System and vice versa shall use the Communication Infrastructure. As far as is necessary for the efficient operation of the Central System, the Agency shall establish the technical procedures necessary for the use of the Communication Infrastructure.\nArticle 27\nAccess to, and correction or erasure of, data recorded in Eurodac\n1.   The Member State of origin shall have access to data which it has transmitted and which are recorded in the Central System in accordance with this Regulation.\nNo Member State may conduct searches of the data transmitted by another Member State, nor may it receive such data apart from data resulting from the comparison referred to in Article 9(5).\n2.   The authorities of Member States which, pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, have access to data recorded in the Central System shall be those designated by each Member State for the purposes laid down in Article 1(1). That designation shall specify the exact unit responsible for carrying out tasks related to the application of this Regulation. Each Member State shall without delay communicate to the Commission and the Agency a list of those units and any amendments thereto. The Agency shall publish the consolidated list in the Official Journal of the European Union. Where there are amendments thereto, the Agency shall publish once a year an updated consolidated list online.\n3.   Only the Member State of origin shall have the right to amend the data which it has transmitted to the Central System by correcting or supplementing such data, or to erase them, without prejudice to erasure carried out in pursuance of Article 12(2) or 16(1).\n4.   If a Member State or the Agency has evidence to suggest that data recorded in the Central System are factually inaccurate, it shall advise the Member State of origin as soon as possible.\nIf a Member State has evidence to suggest that data were recorded in the Central System in breach of this Regulation, it shall advise the Agency, the Commission and the Member State of origin as soon as possible. The Member State of origin shall check the data concerned and, if necessary, amend or erase them without delay.\n5.   The Agency shall not transfer or make available to the authorities of any third country data recorded in the Central System.

andenable law-enforcement authorities, subject to strict conditions, to consult Eurodac for the investigation, detection and prevention of terrorist or serious criminal offences.\nKEY POINTS\nEach EU country must take the fingerprints of all asylum applicants and those apprehended while trying to cross a border irregularly (e.g. non-EU/EEA nationals or stateless persons entering without valid documents) over the age of 14 and, within 72 hours, transmit the data to Eurodac.\nWhen an asylum applicant or non-EU/EEA national has been found to be present illegally in an EU country, then that EU country can consult Eurodac to determine whether the individual has previously applied for asylum in an EU country or has previously been apprehended when trying to unlawfully enter the EU.\nFingerprint data should be erased once asylum applicants, non-EU/EEA nationals or stateless persons obtain citizenship of an EU country.\nThis regulation helps apply the Dublin III Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 604/2013), which lays down rules for determining which EU country is responsible for examining an asylum application.\nThe original Eurodac legislation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) did not offer a means for law enforcement authorities to request data comparisons. This regulation, however, allows police forces and Europol to compare fingerprints linked to criminal investigations with those contained in Eurodac. However, due to the fundamental right to privacy, law-enforcement agencies are only allowed to use Eurodac for comparisons: where there are reasonable grounds that doing so will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence; andonly as a last resort after several other checks have been carried out first.\nNo Eurodac data may be shared with non-EU countries (other than Iceland and Norway).\nSome asylum applicants and non-EU/EEA nationals or stateless persons have refused to cooperate with EU countries’ attempts to fingerprint them for the Eurodac database. This led the European Commission to issue a document on possible best practice relating to fingerprinting.\nThe Protocol between the EU, Iceland and Norway, signed in 2020, extends the application of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 to Norway and Iceland.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 20 July 2015.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nEurodac was originally created in 2000 (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) and it has been operating since 2003. The Commission considers it to be a very successful information technology (IT) tool.\nIdentification of applicants (Eurodac) (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 603/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the establishment of ‘Eurodac’ for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person and on requests for the comparison with Eurodac data by Member States’ law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes, and amending Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a European Agency for the Operational Management of large-scale IT Systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, pp. 1-30)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nProtocol between the European Union, Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway to the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway regarding access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes (OJ L 64, 3.3.2020, pp. 3-7)\nCommission staff working document on implementation of the Eurodac regulation as regards the obligation to take fingerprints (SWD(2015) 150 final of 27.5.2015)\nRegulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person (OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, pp. 31-59)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 have been incorporated into the original text.
