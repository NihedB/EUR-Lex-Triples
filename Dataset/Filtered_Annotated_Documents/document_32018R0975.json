{"celex_id": "32018R0975", "reference": "16.7.2018\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 179/30\nREGULATION (EU) 2018/975 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 4 July 2018\nlaying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), is to ensure that the exploitation of marine biological resources contributes to long-term environmental, economic and social sustainability.\n(2)\nThe Union has, by means of Council Decision 98/392/EC (4), approved the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which contains principles and rules with regard to the conservation and management of the living resources of the sea. In the framework of its wider international obligations, the Union participates in efforts made in international waters to conserve fish stocks.\n(3)\nPursuant to Council Decision 2012/130/EU (5), the Union has been a Contracting Party to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean (‘the SPRFMO Convention’), which established the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (the SPRFMO), since 26 July 2010.\n(4)\nWithin the SPRFMO, the Commission of the SPRFMO (‘the SPRFMO Commission’) is responsible for the adoption of measures designed to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources through the application of the precautionary approach to fisheries management and an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, and, in so doing, to safeguard the marine ecosystems in which those resources occur. Such measures may become binding upon the Union.\n(5)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the conservation and management measures adopted by the SPRFMO (‘SPRFMO conservation and management measures’) are fully transposed into Union law and are, therefore, uniformly and effectively implemented within the Union.\n(6)\nThe SPRFMO has the authority to adopt conservation and management measures for the fisheries under its purview, which are binding on the Contracting Parties to the SPRFMO Convention (‘Contracting Parties’). Those measures are primarily addressed to the Contracting Parties and provide for obligations for operators such as vessel masters.\n(7)\nThis Regulation should not cover the fishing opportunities decided by the SPRFMO, as those fishing opportunities are allocated in the framework of the annual Regulation on fishing opportunities adopted pursuant to Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(8)\nWhen implementing the SPRFMO conservation and management measures, the Union and Member States should endeavour to promote the use of fishing gear and techniques which are selective and which have a reduced environmental impact.\n(9)\nIn order to swiftly incorporate into Union law future binding amendments to the SPRFMO conservation and management measures, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the Annexes to and the relevant Articles of this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (6). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(10)\nTo ensure compliance with the CFP, Union legislation has been adopted to establish a system of control, inspection and enforcement, which includes the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) activities.\n(11)\nIn particular, Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (7) establishes a Union system for control, inspection and enforcement with a global and integrated approach to ensure compliance with all the rules of the CFP, and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 (8) lays down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 (9) establishes a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. Furthermore, Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) lays down rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for Union fishing vessels conducting fishing operations in waters under the auspices of a regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) to which the Union is a contracting party. Those Regulations already implement a number of the provisions laid down in the SPRFMO conservation and management measures. It is therefore not necessary to include those provisions in this Regulation.\n(12)\nArticle 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 introduced a landing obligation which applies from 1 January 2015 to fisheries for small and large pelagic species, fisheries for industrial purposes and fisheries for salmon in the Baltic Sea. However, under Article 15(2) of that Regulation, the landing obligation is without prejudice to the Union's international obligations, such as those resulting from the SPRFMO conservation and management measures,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down management, conservation and control provisions relating to fishing for straddling fish stocks in the SPRFMO Convention Area.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation shall apply to:\n(a)\nUnion fishing vessels operating in the SPRFMO Convention Area;\n(b)\nUnion fishing vessels transhipping fishery products harvested in the SPRFMO Convention Area;\n(c)\nthird country fishing vessels upon requesting access to, or being the object of an inspection in, Union ports and carrying fishery products harvested in the SPRFMO Convention Area.\nArticle 3\nRelationship to other Union acts\nExcept where expressly provided otherwise in this Regulation, this Regulation shall apply without prejudice to Regulations (EC) No 1005/2008, (EC) No 1224/2009 and (EU) 2017/2403.\nArticle 4\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘SPRFMO Convention Area’ means the geographical area marked out in Article 5 of the SPRFMO Convention;\n(2)\n‘fishing vessel’ means any vessel of any size used or intended for use for the purposes of commercial exploitation of fishery resources, including support ships, fish processing vessels, vessels engaged in transhipment and carrier vessels equipped for the transportation of fishery products, except container vessels;\n(3)\n‘Union fishing vessel’ means a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State and registered in the Union;\n(4)\n‘SPRFMO fishery resources’ means all marine biological resources within the SPRFMO Convention Area excluding:\n(a)\nsedentary species in so far as they are subject to the national jurisdiction of coastal States pursuant to Article 77, paragraph 4 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (‘UNCLOS’);\n(b)\nhighly migratory species listed in Annex I to UNCLOS;\n(c)\nanadromous and catadromous species;\n(d)\nmarine mammals, marine reptiles and sea birds;\n(5)\n‘SPRFMO fishery products’ means aquatic organisms, or products derived therefrom, resulting from any fishing activity within the SPRFMO Convention Area;\n(6)\n‘fishing activity’ means searching for fish, shooting, setting, towing, hauling of a fishing gear, taking catch on board, transhipping, retaining on board, processing on board, transferring and landing of fish and fishery products;\n(7)\n‘bottom fishing’ means the fishing by any fishing vessel using any gear which is likely to come in contact with the seafloor or benthic organisms during the normal course of operations;\n(8)\n‘bottom fishing footprint’ means the spatial extent of bottom fishing in the SPRFMO Convention Area during the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006;\n(9)\n‘IUU fishing’ means any illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing activities as defined in points 1 to 4 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008;\n(10)\n‘draft SPRFMO IUU vessel list’ means the initial list of fishing vessels presumed to have undertaken IUU fishing, as drafted by the SPRFMO Secretariat and submitted to the SPRFMO Compliance and Technical Committee forconsideration;\n(11)\n‘exploratory fishery’ means a fishery that has not been subject to fishing or has not been subject to fishing with a particular gear type or technique in the previous 10 years;\n(12)\n‘large-scale pelagic driftnet’ means a gillnet or other net, or a combination of nets, which is more than 2,5 kilometres in length the purpose of which is to enmesh, entrap or entangle fish by drifting on the surface or in the water;\n(13)\n‘deepwater gillnets’ e.g. trammel nets, set nets, anchored nets, sink nets, means strings of single, double or triple netting walls, held vertically, on or near the bottom, in which fish will gill, entangle or enmesh. Deepwater gillnets consist of single or, less commonly, double or triple netting mounted together on the same frame ropes. Several types of nets may be combined in one gear.

(Yes/No)\nIf yes, describe.\nE.   Length-frequency data to be collected\nRepresentative and randomly sampled length-frequency data are to be collected for the target species and, time permitting, for other main by-catch species. Length data are to be collected and recorded at the most precise level appropriate for the species (cm or mm and whether to the nearest unit or unit below) and the type of measurement used (total length, fork length, or standard length) is also to be recorded. If possible, the total weight of length-frequency samples is to be recorded, or estimated and the method of estimation recorded, and observers may be required to also determine sex of measured fish to generate length-frequency data stratified by sex.\n1.   Commercial sampling protocol\n(a)\nFish species other than skates, rays and sharks:\n(i)\nfork length is to be measured to the nearest cm for fish which attain a maximum length greater than 40 cm fork length\n(ii)\nfork length is to be measured to the nearest mm for fish which attain a maximum length less than 40 cm fork length;\n(b)\nSkates and rays:\nMaximum disk width is to be measured;\n(c)\nSharks:\nAppropriate length measurement to be used is to be selected for each species (see FAO technical report 474 on measuring sharks). As a default, total length is to be measured.\n2.   Scientific sampling protocol\nFor scientific sampling of species, length measurements may need to be made at a finer resolution than specified in point 1.\nF.   Biological sampling to be conducted\n1.   The following biological data are to be collected for representative samples of the main target species and, time permitting, for other main by-catch species contributing to the catch:\n(a)\nSpecies\n(b)\nLength (mm or cm), with a record of the type of length measurement used. Measurement precision and type are to be determined on a species by species basis consistent with that defined in Section E\n(c)\nSex (male, female, immature, unsexed)\n(d)\nMaturity stage\n2.   Observers are to collect tissue, otolith and/or stomach samples according to pre- determined specific research programmes implemented by the SPRFMO Scientific Committee or other national scientific research.\n3.   Observers are to be briefed and provided with written length-frequency and biological sampling protocols, where appropriate, and priorities for the above sampling specific to each observer trip.\nG.   Data to be collected on incidental captures of seabirds, mammals, turtles and other species of concern\n1.   The following data are to be collected for all seabirds, mammals, reptiles (turtles) and other species of concern caught in fishing operations:\n(a)\nSpecies (identified taxonomically as far as possible, or accompanied by photographs if identification is difficult) and size\n(b)\nCount of the number of each species caught per tow or set\n(c)\nFate of by-caught animal(s) (retained or released/discarded)\n(d)\nIf released, life status (vigorous, alive, lethargic, dead) upon release\n(e)\nIf dead, then collect adequate information or samples for onshore identification in accordance with pre-determined sampling protocols. Where this is not possible, observers may be required to collect sub-samples of identifying parts, as specified in biological sampling protocols.\n(f)\nRecord the type of interaction (hook/line entanglement/warp strike/net capture/other)\nIf other, provide a description.\n2.   Record sex of each individual for taxa where this is feasible from external observation, such as pinnipeds, small cetaceans or Elasmobranchii and other species of concern.\n3.   Were there any circumstances or actions that may have contributed to the by-catch event? (for example tori line tangle, high levels of bait loss).\nH.   Detection of fishing in association with VMEs\nFor each observed trawl, the following data are to be collected for all sensitive benthic species caught, particularly vulnerable or habitat-forming species such as sponges, sea fans, or corals:\n(a)\nSpecies (identified taxonomically as far as possible, or accompanied by a photograph where identification is difficult);\n(b)\nAn estimate of the quantity (weight (kg) or volume (m3)) of each listed benthic species caught in the tow;\n(c)\nAn overall estimate of the total quantity (weight (kg) or volume (m3)) of all invertebrate benthic species caught in the tow;\n(d)\nWhere possible, and particularly for new or scarce benthic species which do not appear in guides for the identification of species, whole samples are to be collected and suitably preserved for identification on shore.\nI.   Data to be collected for all tag recoveries\nThe following data are to be collected for all recovered fish, seabird, mammal or reptile tags if the organism is dead, to be retained, or alive:\n(a)\nObserver name\n(b)\nVessel name\n(c)\nVessel call sign\n(d)\nVessel flag\n(e)\nCollect, label (with all details below) and store the actual tags for later return to the tagging agency\n(f)\nSpecies from which tag recovered\n(g)\nTag colour and type (spaghetti, archival)\n(h)\nTag numbers (The tag number is to be provided for all tags when multiple tags were attached to one fish. If only one tag was recorded, a statement is required that specifies whether or not the other tag was missing.) If the organism is alive and to be released, tag information is to be collected in accordance with predetermined sampling protocols.\n(i)\nDate and time of capture (UTC)\n(j)\nLocation of capture (Lat/Lon, to the nearest 1 minute)\n(k)\nAnimal length/size (cm or mm) with description of what measurement was taken (such as total length, fork length, etc.). Length measurements are to be collected according to the criteria defined in Section E.\n(l)\nSex (F = female, M = male, I = indeterminate, D = not examined)\n(m)\nWhether the tags were found during a period of fishing that was being observed (Yes/No)\n(n)\nReward information (e.g. name and address where to send reward)\n(It is recognised that some of the data recorded here duplicates data that already exists in the previous categories of information. This is necessary because tag recovery information may be sent separately to other observer data.)\nJ.   Hierarchies for observer data collection\n1.   Recognising that observers may not be able to collect all of the data described in these standards on each trip, a hierarchy of priorities is to be implemented for collection of observer data. Trip-specific or programme-specific observer task priorities may be developed in response to specific research programme requirements, in which case such priorities are to be followed by observers.\n2.   In the absence of trip- or programme-specific priorities, the following generalised priorities are to be followed by observers:\n(a)\nFishing Operation Information\nAll vessel and tow/set/effort information\n(b)\nReporting of Catches\n(i)\nRecord time, weight of catch sampled versus total catch or effort (e.g. number of hooks), and total numbers of each species caught\n(ii)\nIdentification and counts of seabirds, mammals, reptiles (turtles), sensitive benthic species and vulnerable species\n(iii)\nRecord numbers or weights of each species retained or discarded\n(iv)\nRecord instances of depredation, where appropriate\n(c)\nBiological Sampling\n(i)\nCheck for presence of tags\n(ii)\nLength-frequency data for target species\n(iii)\nBasic biological data (sex, maturity) for target species\n(iv)\nLength-frequency data for main by-catch species\n(v)\nOtoliths (and stomach samples, if being collected) for target species\n(vi)\nBasic biological data for by-catch species\n(vii)\nBiological samples of by-catch species (if being collected)\n(viii)\nTake photos\n(d)\nThe reporting of catches and biological sampling procedures are to be prioritised among species groups as follows:\nSpecies\nPriority (1 highest)\nPrimary target species (such as jack mackerel, for pelagic fisheries, and orange roughy for demersal fisheries)\n1\nSeabirds, mammals, reptiles (turtles) or other species of concern\n2\nOther species typically within top 5 in the fishery (such as blue mackerel for pelagic fisheries, and oreos and alfonsino for demersal fisheries)\n3\nAll other species\n4\nThe allocation of observer effort among these activities will depend on the type of operation and setting. The size of sub-samples relative to unobserved quantities (such as the number of hooks examined for species composition relative to the number of hooks set) is to be explicitly recorded under the guidance of Member State observer programmes.\nK.   Coding specifications to be used for recording observer data\n1.   Unless otherwise specified for specific data types, observer data are to be provided in accordance with the same coding specifications as specified in this section.\n2.   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is to be used to describe times.\n3.   Decimal degrees are to be used to describe locations.\n4.   The following coding schemes are to be used:\n(a)\nspecies are to be described using the FAO 3 letter species codes;\n(b)\nfishing methods are to be described using the International Standard Classification of Fishing Gear (ISSCFG – 29 July 1980) codes;\n(c)\ntypes of fishing vessel are to be described using the International Standard Classification of Fishery Vessels (ISSCFV) codes.\n5.   Metric units of measure are to be used, specifically:\n(a)\nkilograms are to be used to describe catch weight;\n(b)\nmetres are to be used to describe height, width, depth, beam or length;\n(c)\ncubic metres are to be used to describe volume;\n(d)\nkilowatts are to be used to describe engine power.\nL.

South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO)\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2018/975 — management, conservation and control measures applicable in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?\nIt aims to ensure that management, conservation and control rules of the convention area of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) are fully incorporated into EU law.\nThe regulation works alongside the EU fisheries control system for the checking, inspection and enforcement by national authorities of the rules of the common fisheries policy.\nKEY POINTS\nSPRFMO\nSPRFMO is an inter-governmental organisation committed to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources of the South Pacific Ocean.\nThe EU is a contracting party.\nScope and application\nThe regulation applies to: EU fishing vessels operating in the SPRFMO convention area;EU fishing vessels transshipping* fishery products caught in the SPRFMO convention area;non-EU country fishing vessels upon requesting access to, or being the object of an inspection in, EU ports and carrying fishery products harvested in the SPRFMO convention area.\nIt applies without prejudice to: Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 (see summary);Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (see summary);Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 (see summary).\nRules\nrequires EU countries to ensure a minimum 10% scientific observer coverage in the jack mackerel fishery and stop fishing when they have reached 100% of its catch limit;\nrequires EU vessels to observe rules to protect seabirds including the use of bird scaring lines;\nto protect vulnerable marine ecosystems*, prohibits EU vessels from engaging in bottom fishing* or exploratory fishing* without authorisation from SPRFMO and on the basis of a bottom fishing assessment evaluated by the SPRFMO Scientific Committee;\nrequires at least 10% of observer coverage for long-liners fishing for bottom fishing species and to cease from bottom fishing activities within 5 nautical miles of the area where any encounter with vulnerable marine ecosystems exceeds the threshold levels;\nbans the use of large scale pelagic drifting nets (gillnets or combinations of nets exceeding 2.5 kilometres in length), and all deepwater gillnets* throughout the SPRFMO convention area;\nrequires the notification of transshipment of jack mackerel and demersal species and its monitoring when an observer is on board;\nrequires EU vessels intending to transit the convention area while carrying gillnets to notify the SPRFMO Secretariat at least 36 hours before entering the area and to ensure that the vessels flying their flag operate a vessel monitoring system reporting once every 2 hours while in the SPRFMO convention area;\nrequires EU countries to submit to the Commission, by 15 November each year, a list of fishing vessels flying their flag authorised to fish in the SPRFMO convention area for the following year, including the information contained in Annex V. The Commission forwards that list to the SPRFMO Secretariat;\nEU countries whose vessels fish in the SPRFMO must set up observer programmes to collect data on fish caught to be submitted to the Commission.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 19 July 2018.\nBACKGROUND\nThe South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (European Commission)\nKEY TERMS\n              \nTransshipping: the transfer of a catch from a smaller fishing boat to a larger one, which then incorporates it into a larger batch for shipment.\nVulnerable marine ecosystems: any marine ecosystem the integrity (i.e. ecosystem structure or function) of which is, according to the best scientific information available and to the precautionary principle, threatened by significant adverse impacts resulting from physical contact with bottom gears in the normal course of fishing operations, including reefs, seamounts, cold water corals or cold water sponge beds.\nBottom fishing: fishing by any fishing vessel using any gear which is likely to come in contact with the seafloor or benthic organisms (i.e. those found in the ecological region at the lowest level of the ocean) during the normal course of operations.\nExploratory fishing: fishing in an area that has not been subject to fishing or has not been subject to fishing with a particular gear type or technique in the previous 10 years.\nDeepwater gillnets: single or, less commonly, double- or triple-netting mounted together on the same frame ropes. Several types of nets may be combined in one gear. Those nets can be used either alone or, as is more usual, in large numbers placed in line (‘fleets’ of nets). The gear can be set, anchored to the bottom or left drifting, free or connected with the vessel.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2018/975 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 laying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area (OJ L 179, 16.7.2018, pp. 30-75)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 (OJ L 347, 28.12.2017, pp. 81-104)\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 2004/585/EC (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, pp. 22-61)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 have been incorporated into the original text.
