The Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, as regards contract award procedures falling withing the scope of Directives 71/305/EEC and 77/62/EEC, decisions taken by the contracting authorities may be reviewed  effectively and, in particular, as rapidly as possible in accordance with the conditions set out in the following Articles, and, in particular, Article 2 (7) on the grounds that such decisions have infringed Community law in the field of public  procurement or national rules implementing that law.  2.  Member States shall ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming injury in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing  Community law and other national rules.  3.  The Member States shall ensure that the review procedures are available, under detailed rules which the Member States may establish, at least to any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular public supply or public works  contract and who has been or risks being harmed by an alleged infringement. In particular, the Member States may require that the person seeking the review must have previously notified the contracting authority of the alleged infringement and of his  intention to seek review.  Article 2 1.  The Member States shall ensure that the measures taken concerning the review procedures specified in Article 1 include provision for the powers to:  (a)  take, at the earliest opportunity and by way of interlocutory procedures, interim measures with the aim of correcting the alleged infringement or preventing further damage to the interests concerned, including measures to suspend or to ensure the  suspension of the procedure for the award of a public contract or the implementation of any decision taken by the contracting authority;  (b)  either set aside or ensure the setting aside of decisions taken unlawfully, including the removal of discriminatory technical, economic or financial specifications in the invitation to tender, the contract documents or in any other document  relating to the contract award procedure;  (c)  award damages to persons harmed by an infringement.  2. The powers specified in paragraph 1 may be conferred on separate bodies responsible for different aspects of the review procedure.  3. Review procedures need not in themselves have an automatic suspensive effect on the contract award procedures to which they relate.  4.  The Member States may provide that when considering whether to order interim measures the body responsible may take into account the probable consequences of the measures for all interests likely to be harmed, as well as the public interest, and may  decide not to grant such measures where their negative consequences could exceed their benefits. A decision not to grant interim measures shall not prejudice any other claim of the person seeking these measures.  5.  The Member States may provide that where damages are claimed on the grounds that a decision was taken unlawfully, the contested decision must first be set aside by a body having the necessary powers.  6.  The effects of the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 1 on a contract concluded subsequent to its award shall be determined by national law.  Furthermore, except where a decision must be set aside prior to the award of damages, a Member State may provide that, after the conclusion of a contract following its award, the powers of the body responsible for the review procedures shall be limited  to awarding damages to any person harmed by an infringement.  7.  The Member States shall ensure that decisions taken by bodies responsible for review procedures can be effectively enforced.  8.  Where bodies responsible for review procedures are not judicial in character, written reasons for their decisions shall always be given. Furthermore, in such a case, provision must be made to guarantee procedures whereby any allegedly illegal  measure taken by the review body or any alleged defect in the exercise of the powers conferred on it can be the subject of judicial review or review by another body which is a court or tribunal within the meaning of Article 177 of the EEC Treaty and  independent of both the contracting authority and the review body.  The members of such an independent body shall be appointed and leave office under the same conditions as members of the judiciary as regards the authority responsible for their appointment, their period of office, and their removal. At least the  President of this independent body shall have the same legal and professional qualifications as members of the judiciary. The independent body shall take its decisions following a procedure in which both sides are heard, and these decisions shall, by  means determined by each Member State, be legally binding.  Article 3 1.  The Commission may invoke the procedure for which this Article provides when, prior to a contract being concluded, it considers that a clear and manifest infringement of Community provisions in the field of public procurement has been  committed during a contract award procedure falling within the scope of Directives 71/305/EEC and 77/62/EEC.  2.  The Commission shall notify the Member State and the contracting authority concerned of the reasons which have led it to conclude that a clear and manifest infringement has been committed and request its correction.  3.  Within 21 days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State concerned shall communicate to the Commission:  (a)  its confirmation that the infringement has been corrected; or (b)  a reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made; or (c)  a notice to the effect that the contract award procedure has been suspended either by the contracting authority on its own initiative or on the basis of the powers specified in Article 2 (1) (a).  4.  A reasoned submission in accordance with paragraph 3 (b) may rely among other matters on the fact that the alleged infringement is already the subject of judicial or other review proceedings or of a review as referred to in Article 2 (8). In such a  case, the Member State shall inform the Commission of the result of those proceedings as soon as it becomes known.  5.  Where notice has been given that a contract award procedure has been suspended in accordance with paragraph 3 (c), the Member State shall notify the Commission when the suspension is lifted or another contract procedure relating in whole or in part  to the same subject matter is begun. That notification shall confirm that the alleged infringement has been corrected or include a reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made.  Article 4 1.  Not later than four years after the implementation of this Directive, the Commission, in consultation with the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts, shall review the manner in which the provisions of this Directive have been implemented and, if necessary, make proposals for amendments.  2.  By 1 March each year the Member States shall communicate to the Commission information on the operation of their national review procedures during the preceding calendar year. The nature of the information shall be determined by the Commission in  consultation with the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts.  Article 5 Member States shall bring into force, before 1 December 1991, the measures necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main national laws, regulations and administrative provisions which  they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.

Directive 2014/23/EU (see summary) and Directive 2014/24/EU (see summary) replace Directive 2004/18/EC from 18 April 2016.\nEU countries must ensure that the review procedures are available at least to any person having, or having had, an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been, or risks being, harmed by an alleged infringement.\nDirective 89/665/EEC allows actions to be brought both before the contract is signed (pre-contractual remedies) and after (post-contractual remedies). Pre-contractual remedies are intended to correct the infringement of the public procurement rules in the course of the tendering procedure and, in any event, before the contract becomes effective. They include the right to interim measures, a compulsory standstill period and the requirement to suspend the award procedure whilst the appeal is being investigated to prevent the award of the contract.Post-contractual remedies aim to declare an existing contract ineffective and/or to provide compensation (mainly damages) to the affected parties after the contract in question has been awarded.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 3 January 1990 and had to become law in the EU countries by 21 December 1991.\nBACKGROUND\nDirective 89/665/EEC was thoroughly amended by Directive 2007/66/EC. Directive 2014/23/EU introduced further amendments, mainly to extend the scope of Directive 89/665/EEC with regard to concessions under Directive 2014/23/EU and to update the references to the substantive rules for public contracts laid down in Directive 2014/24/EU.\nDirective 92/13/EEC (see summary) is the equivalent of Directive 89/665/EEC for public contracts in the utilities sector. It was thoroughly amended by Directive 2007/66/EC. Directive 2014/23/EU introduced further amendments for the needs of Directive 2014/25/EU (see summary).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 89/665/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts (OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, pp. 33-35)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 89/665/EEC have been incorporated in the original text.
