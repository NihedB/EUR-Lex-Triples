In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(9)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (3) provides a reference framework for statistics in the field of fisheries. In particular, it requires conformity with principles of impartiality, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness, statistical confidentiality and transparency.\n(10)\nThe collection and submission of statistical data is an essential tool for the sound management of the Common Fisheries Policy.\n(11)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).\n(12)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt technical changes to the Annexes to this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(13)\nThe Commission should be assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC (5),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObligations of the Member States\nMember States shall submit to the Commission statistics on all the aquaculture activities conducted in freshwater and saltwaters on their territory.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘Community statistics’ as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 322/97;\n(b)\n‘aquaculture’ as defined in Article 3(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (6);\n(c)\n‘capture-based aquaculture’ means the practice of collecting specimens from the wild and their subsequent use in aquaculture;\n(d)\n‘production’ means the output from aquaculture at first sale, including production from hatcheries and nurseries offered for sale.\n2.   All other definitions for the purpose of this Regulation are set out in Annex I.\nArticle 3\nCompilation of statistics\n1.   Member States shall use surveys or other statistically validated methods covering at least 90 % of the total production by volume, or by number for the production of hatcheries and nurseries, without prejudice to paragraph 4. The remaining part of the total production may be estimated. To estimate more than 10 % of the total production, a request for derogation may be submitted under the conditions provided for in Article 8.\n2.   Use of sources other than surveys shall be subject to provision of an ex-post assessment of the statistical quality of those sources.\n3.   A Member State having a total annual production of less than 1 000 tonnes may submit summary data estimating the total production.\n4.   Member States shall identify the production by species. However, the production of those species which individually do not exceed 500 tonnes and do not represent more than 5 % in weight of the production by volume in a Member State may be estimated and aggregated. The production of hatcheries and nurseries in number of those species may be estimated.\nArticle 4\nData\nThe data shall relate to the reference calendar year and shall cover:\n(a)\nthe annual production (volume and unit value) of aquaculture;\n(b)\nthe annual input (volume and unit value) to capture-based aquaculture;\n(c)\nthe annual production of hatcheries and nurseries;\n(d)\nthe structure of the aquaculture sector.\nArticle 5\nSubmission of data\n1.   The Member States shall submit the data referred to in Annexes II, III and IV to the Commission (Eurostat) within 12 months of the end of the reference calendar year. The first reference calendar year shall be 2008.\n2.   Starting with the data for the year 2008 and at intervals of three years thereafter, the data on the structure of the aquaculture sector referred to in Annex V shall be submitted within 12 months of the end of the reference calendar year to the Commission (Eurostat).\nArticle 6\nQuality assessment\n1.   Each Member State shall provide the Commission (Eurostat) with a yearly report on the quality of the data submitted.\n2.   At the submission of the data, each Member State shall submit to the Commission a detailed methodological report. In that report, each Member State shall describe how the data were collected and compiled. This report shall include details of sampling techniques, estimation methods and of sources used other than surveys and an evaluation of the quality of the resultant estimates. A proposed format for the methodological report is indicated in Annex VI.\n3.   The Commission shall examine the reports and present its conclusions to the relevant working group of the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Decision 72/279/EEC.\nArticle 7\nTransitional period\n1.   Full calendar year transitional periods for implementing this Regulation lasting not more than three years from 1 January 2009 may be granted to Member States in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 10(2), in so far as the application of this Regulation to their national statistical systems requires major adaptations and is likely to cause significant practical problems.\n2.   To this end, a Member State shall present a duly motivated request to the Commission by 31 December 2008.\nArticle 8\nDerogations\n1.   In cases where inclusion in the statistics of a particular sector of aquaculture activities would cause difficulties to the national authorities not commensurate with the importance of that sector, a derogation may be granted in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 10(2).\nSuch derogation shall permit a Member State to exclude data covering that sector from the national data submitted or to employ estimation methods used to provide data for more than 10 % of the total production.\n2.   Member States shall support any request for derogations, which must be made prior to the deadline for the first submission of the data, by sending the Commission a report on problems encountered in applying this Regulation.\n3.   Should a change in the situation for collecting the data create unforeseen difficulties for the national authorities, a duly justified request for a derogation may be submitted by the Member States after the deadline for the first submission of the data.\nArticle 9\nTechnical provisions\n1.   The measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, relating to technical changes to the Annexes shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 10(3).\n2.   The format in which statistics shall be submitted shall be adopted in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 10(2).\nArticle 10\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 4(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nArticle 11\nEvaluation report\nBy 31 December 2011 and every three years thereafter, the Commission shall submit an evaluation report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the statistics compiled pursuant to this Regulation and, in particular, on their relevance and quality.\nThis report shall also undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis of the system introduced to collect and draw up the statistics and shall indicate best practices to lessen the workload for Member States and enhance the usefulness and quality of the data.\nArticle 12\nRepeal\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3, Regulation (EC) No 788/96 is hereby repealed.\n2.   References to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation.\n3.   By way of derogation from the second paragraph of Article 13 of this Regulation, a Member State having been granted a transitional period in accordance with Article 7 of this Regulation shall continue to apply the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 788/96 for the duration of the transitional period granted.\nArticle 13\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 9 July 2008.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

For statistical purposes, hatcheries are limited to the production of fertilised eggs. First juvenile stages of aquatic animals are considered as being produced in nurseries.\n7.\n‘Enclosures and pens’ means areas of water confined by nets, mesh and other barriers allowing uncontrolled water interchange and distinguished by the fact that enclosures occupy the full water column between substrate and surface; pens and enclosures generally enclose a relatively large volume of water.\n8.\n‘Cages’ means open or covered enclosed structures constructed with net, mesh or any porous material allowing natural water interchange. These structures may be floating, suspended or fixed to the substrate but still permitting water interchange from below.\n9.\n‘Tanks and raceways’ means artificial units constructed above or below ground level capable of high rates of water interchange or with a high water turnover rate and highly controlled environment but without water recirculation.\n10.\n‘Recirculation systems’ means systems where the water is reused after some form of treatment (e.g. filtering).\n11.\n‘Transferred to a controlled environment’ means the intentional release for further aquaculture practices.\n12.\n‘Released to the wild’ means the intentional release for the restocking of rivers, lakes and other waters other than for aquaculture purposes. These releases may then be available for capture by fishing operations.\n13.\n‘Volume’ means:\n(a)\nfor fish, crustaceans and molluscs and other aquatic animals, the live weight equivalent of the product. For molluscs, the live weight shall include the weight of the shell;\n(b)\nfor aquatic plants, the wet weight of the product.\n14.\n‘Unit value’ means the total value (excluding invoiced value-added tax) of the production (in national currency) divided by the total volume of the production.\nANNEX II\nProduction from aquaculture excluding nurseries and hatcheries (1)\nCountry:\nYear:\nSpecies produced\nFAO major area\nFreshwater\nSaltwater\nTotal\n3-alpha code\nCommon name\nScientific name\nVolume\n(metric tonnes)\nUnit value\n(national currency)\nVolume\n(metric tonnes)\nUnit value\n(national currency)\nVolume\n(metric tonnes)\nUnit value\n(national currency)\nFISH\nPonds\nTanks and raceways\nEnclosures and pens\nCages\nRecirculation systems\nOther methods\nCRUSTACEANS\nPonds\nTanks and raceways\nEnclosures and pens\nOther methods\nMOLLUSCS\nOn bottom\nOff bottom\nOther methods\nSEAWEEDS\nAll methods\nFish eggs (intended for consumption) (2)\nAll methods\nOTHER AQUATIC ORGANISMS\nAll methods\n(1)  With the exclusion of aquarium and ornamental species.\n(2)  The fish eggs intended for consumption considered under this item refer only to extracted eggs destined for consumption at first sale.\nANNEX III\nInput to capture-based aquaculture\n (1)\nCountry:\nYear:\nSpecies\nUnit (specify) (2)\nUnit value (national currency)\n3-alpha code\nCommon name\nScientific name\nFISH\nCRUSTACEANS\nMOLLUSCS\n(1)  With the exclusion of aquarium, ornamental and plant species.\n(2)  Weight or number;
