{"celex_id": "32009L0125", "reference": "31.10.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 285/10\nDIRECTIVE 2009/125/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 October 2009\nestablishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products (3) has been substantially amended. Since further amendments, strictly limited to the extension of the scope of application of that Directive to include all energy-related products, are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nThe disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by the Member States in relation to the ecodesign of energy-related products can create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Community and may thus have a direct impact on the establishment and functioning of the internal market. The harmonisation of national laws is the only means to prevent such barriers to trade and unfair competition. The extension of the scope to all energy-related products ensures that ecodesign requirements for all significant energy-related products can be harmonised at Community level.\n(3)\nEnergy-related products account for a large proportion of the consumption of natural resources and energy in the Community. They also have a number of other important environmental impacts. For the vast majority of product categories available on the Community market, very different degrees of environmental impact can be noted though they provide similar functional performances. In the interest of sustainable development, continuous improvement in the overall environmental impact of those products should be encouraged, notably by identifying the major sources of negative environmental impacts and avoiding transfer of pollution, when this improvement does not entail excessive costs.\n(4)\nMany energy-related products have a significant potential for being improved in order to reduce environmental impacts and to achieve energy savings through better design which also leads to economic savings for businesses and end-users. In addition to products which use, generate, transfer, or measure energy, certain energy-related products, including products used in construction such as windows, insulation materials, or some water-using products such as shower heads or taps could also contribute to significant energy savings during use.\n(5)\nThe ecodesign of products is a crucial factor in the Community strategy on Integrated Product Policy. As a preventive approach, designed to optimise the environmental performance of products, while maintaining their functional qualities, it provides genuine new opportunities for manufacturers, consumers and society as a whole.\n(6)\nEnergy efficiency improvement — with one of the available options being more efficient end use of electricity — is regarded as contributing substantially to the achievement of greenhouse gas emission targets in the Community. Electricity demand is the fastest growing energy end use category and is projected to grow within the next 20 to 30 years in the absence of any policy action to counteract this trend. A significant reduction in energy consumption as suggested by the Commission in its European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) is possible. Climate change is one of the priorities of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, laid down by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). Energy saving is the most cost-effective way to increase security of supply and reduce import dependency. Therefore, substantial demand-side measures and targets should be adopted.\n(7)\nAction should be taken during the design phase of energy-related products, since it appears that the pollution caused during a product’s life cycle is determined at that stage, and most of the costs involved are committed then.\n(8)\nA coherent framework for the application of Community ecodesign requirements for energy-related products should be established with the aim of ensuring the free movement of those products which comply with such requirements and of improving their overall environmental impact. Such Community requirements should respect the principles of fair competition and international trade.\n(9)\nEcodesign requirements should be set taking account of the goals and priorities of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, including, as appropriate, applicable goals of the relevant thematic strategies of that Programme.\n(10)\nThis Directive seeks to achieve a high level of protection for the environment by reducing the potential environmental impact of energy-related products, which will ultimately be beneficial to consumers and other end-users. Sustainable development also requires proper consideration of the health, social and economic impact of the measures envisaged. Improving the energy and resource efficiency of products contributes to the security of the energy supply and to the reduction of the demand on natural resources, which are preconditions of sound economic activity and therefore of sustainable development.\n(11)\nA Member State that deems it necessary to maintain national provisions on grounds of overriding needs relating to the protection of the environment, or to introduce new provisions based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment on grounds of a problem specific to that Member State that arises after the adoption of the applicable implementing measure, may do so under the conditions laid down in Article 95(4), (5) and (6) of the Treaty, which provides for prior notification to, and approval from, the Commission.\n(12)\nIn order to maximise the environmental benefits from improved design, it may be necessary to inform consumers about the environmental characteristics and performance of energy-related products and to advise them on how to use products in a manner which is environmentally friendly.\n(13)\nThe approach set out in the Commission’s Communication of 18 June 2003 entitled ‘Integrated Product Policy — Building on Environmental Life-Cycle Thinking’, which is a major innovative element of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, aims to reduce the environmental impacts of products across the whole of their life cycle, including in the selection and use of raw materials, in manufacturing, packaging, transport and distribution, installation and maintenance, use and end-of-life. Considering at the design stage a product’s environmental impact throughout its whole life cycle has a high potential to facilitate improved environmental performance in a cost-effective way, including in terms of resource and material efficiency, and thereby to contribute to achieving the objectives of the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources. There should be sufficient flexibility to enable this factor to be integrated in product design whilst taking account of technical, functional and economic considerations.\n(14)\nAlthough a comprehensive approach to environmental performance is desirable, greenhouse gas mitigation through increased energy efficiency should be considered a priority environmental goal pending the adoption of a working plan.\n(15)\nIt may be necessary and justified to establish specific quantified ecodesign requirements for some products or environmental aspects thereof in order to ensure that their environmental impact is minimised. Given the urgent need to contribute to the achievement of the commitments in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and without prejudice to the integrated approach promoted in this Directive, some priority should be given to those measures with a high potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at low cost. Such measures can also contribute to a sustainable use of resources and constitute a major contribution to the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable production and consumption agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September 2002.\n(16)\nAs a general principle and where appropriate, the energy consumption of energy-related products in stand-by or off-mode should be reduced to the minimum necessary for their proper functioning.\n(17)\nWhile the best-performing products or technologies available on the market, including on international markets, should be taken as a reference, the level of ecodesign requirements should be established on the basis of technical, economic and environmental analysis. Flexibility in the method for establishing the level of requirements can make swift improvement of environmental performance easier. Interested parties should be consulted and cooperate actively in this analysis. The setting of mandatory measures requires proper consultation of the parties involved. Such consultation may highlight the need for a phased introduction or transitional measures. The introduction of interim targets increases the predictability of the policy, allows for accommodating product development cycles and facilitates long-term planning for interested parties.\n(18)\nPriority should be given to alternative courses of action such as self-regulation by the industry where such action is likely to deliver the policy objectives faster or in a less costly manner than mandatory requirements. Legislative measures may be needed where market forces fail to evolve in the right direction or at an acceptable speed.\n(19)\nSelf-regulation, including voluntary agreements offered as unilateral commitments by industry, can enable quick progress due to rapid and cost-effective implementation, and allows for flexible and appropriate adaptations to technological options and market sensitivities.\n(20)\nFor the assessment of voluntary agreements or other self-regulation measures presented as alternatives to implementing measures, information on at least the following issues should be available: openness of participation, added value, representativeness, quantified and staged objectives, involvement of civil society, monitoring and reporting, cost-effectiveness of administering a self-regulatory initiative and sustainability.\n(21)\nThe Commission’s Communication of 17 February 2002, entitled ‘Environmental Agreements at Community level within the Framework of the Action Plan on the Simplification and Improvement of the Regulatory Environment’, could provide useful guidance when assessing self-regulation by industry in the context of this Directive.\n(22)\nThis Directive should also encourage the integration of ecodesign in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and very small firms. Such integration could be facilitated by wide availability of, and easy access to, information relating to the sustainability of their products.\n(23)\nEnergy-related products that comply with the ecodesign requirements laid down in implementing measures to this Directive should bear the ‘CE’ marking and associated information, in order to enable them to be placed on the internal market and move freely. The rigorous enforcement of implementing measures is necessary to reduce the environmental impact of regulated energy-related products and to ensure fair competition.\n(24)\nWhen preparing implementing measures and the working plan, the Commission should consult Member States’ representatives as well as interested parties concerned with the product group, such as industry, including SMEs and craft industry, trade unions, traders, retailers, importers, environmental protection groups and consumer organisations.\n(25)\nWhen preparing implementing measures, the Commission should also take due account of existing national environmental legislation, in particular that concerning toxic substances, which Member States have indicated should be preserved, without reducing the existing and justified levels of protection in the Member States.\n(26)\nRegard should be given to the modules and rules intended for use in technical harmonisation Directives set out in Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products (5).\n(27)\nSurveillance authorities should exchange information on the measures envisaged within the scope of this Directive with a view to improving surveillance of the market, having regard to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (6). Such cooperation should make the utmost use of electronic means of communication and relevant Community programmes. The exchange of information on environmental life cycle performance and on the achievements of design solutions should be facilitated. The accumulation and dissemination of the body of knowledge generated by the ecodesign efforts of manufacturers is one of the crucial benefits of this Directive.\n(28)\nA competent body is usually a public or private body, designated by the public authorities, that presents the necessary guarantees for impartiality and availability of technical expertise for carrying out a verification of the product with regard to its compliance with the applicable implementing measures.\n(29)\nNoting the importance of avoiding non-compliance, Member States should ensure that the necessary means are available for effective market surveillance.\n(30)\nIn respect of training and information on ecodesign for SMEs, it may be appropriate to consider accompanying activities.\n(31)\nIt is in the interest of the functioning of the internal market to have standards which have been harmonised at Community level. Once the reference to such a standard has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, compliance with it should raise a presumption of conformity with the corresponding requirements set out in the implementing measure adopted on the basis of this Directive, although other means of demonstrating such conformity should be permitted.\n(32)\nOne of the main roles of harmonised standards should be to help manufacturers in applying the implementing measures adopted under this Directive. Such standards could be essential in establishing measuring and testing methods. In the case of generic ecodesign requirements, harmonised standards could contribute considerably to guiding manufacturers in establishing the ecological profile of their products in accordance with the requirements of the applicable implementing measure. These standards should clearly indicate the relationship between their clauses and the requirements dealt with. The purpose of harmonised standards should not be to fix limits for environmental aspects.\n(33)\nFor the purpose of the definitions used in this Directive it is useful to refer to relevant international standards such as ISO 14040.\n(34)\nThis Directive is in accordance with certain principles for the implementation of the new approach as set out in the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards (7) and of making reference to harmonised European standards. The Council Resolution of 28 October 1999 on the role of standardisation in Europe (8) recommends that the Commission examine whether the New Approach principle could be extended to sectors not yet covered as a means of improving and simplifying legislation wherever possible.\n(35)\nThis Directive is complementary to existing Community instruments such as Council Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances (9), Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme (10), Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (11), Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (12), Directive 2006/121/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 amending Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and establishing a European Chemicals Agency (13) and Regulation (EC) No 106/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (14). Synergies between this Directive and the existing Community instruments should contribute to increasing their respective impacts and building coherent requirements for manufacturers to apply.\n(36)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (15).\n(37)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend or repeal Council Directive 92/42/EEC (16), and Directives 96/57/EC (17) and 2000/55/EC (18) of the European Parliament and of the Council. Such amendment or repeal must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(38)\nIn addition, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing measures laying down ecodesign requirements for defined energy-related products, including the introduction of implementing measures during the transitional period, and including where appropriate provisions on the balancing of the various environmental aspects. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(39)\nThe Commission should, on the basis of the experience gained from applying this Directive, Directive 2005/32/EC and implementing measures, review the operation, methods and effectiveness of this Directive and assess the appropriateness of extending its scope beyond energy-related products. Within that review, the Commission should consult Member States’ representatives as well as concerned interested parties.\n(40)\nMember States should determine the penalties to be applied in the event of infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(41)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure the functioning of the internal market by requiring products to reach an adequate level of environmental performance, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(42)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with Directive 2005/32/EC. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(43)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex IX, Part B.\n(44)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (19), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Directive establishes a framework for the setting of Community ecodesign requirements for energy-related products with the aim of ensuring the free movement of such products within the internal market.\n2.   This Directive provides for the setting of requirements which the energy-related products covered by implementing measures must fulfil in order to be placed on the market and/or put into service. It contributes to sustainable development by increasing energy efficiency and the level of protection of the environment, while at the same time increasing the security of the energy supply.\n3.   This Directive shall not apply to means of transport for persons or goods.\n4.   This Directive and the implementing measures adopted pursuant thereto shall be without prejudice to Community waste management legislation and Community chemicals legislation, including Community legislation on fluorinated greenhouse gases.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘Energy-related product’, (a ‘product’), means any good that has an impact on energy consumption during use which is placed on the market and/or put into service, and includes parts intended to be incorporated into energy-related products covered by this Directive which are placed on the market and/or put into service as individual parts for end-users and of which the environmental performance can be assessed independently;\n2.\n‘Components and sub-assemblies’ means parts intended to be incorporated into products which are not placed on the market and/or put into service as individual parts for end-users or the environmental performance of which cannot be assessed independently;\n3.\n‘Implementing measures’ means measures adopted pursuant to this Directive laying down ecodesign requirements for defined products or for environmental aspects thereof;\n4.\n‘Placing on the market’ means making a product available for the first time on the Community market with a view to its distribution or use within the Community, whether for reward or free of charge and irrespective of the selling technique;\n5.\n‘Putting into service’ means the first use of a product for its intended purpose by an end-user in the Community;\n6.\n‘Manufacturer’ means the natural or legal person who manufactures products covered by this Directive and is responsible for their conformity with this Directive in view of their being placed on the market and/or put into service under the manufacturer’s own name or trademark or for the manufacturer’s own use.

The CE marking consists of the initials ‘CE’ as shown in Annex III.\n3.   The EC declaration of conformity shall contain the elements specified in Annex VI and shall refer to the appropriate implementing measure.\n4.   The affixing of markings on a product which are likely to mislead users as to the meaning or form of the CE marking shall be prohibited.\n5.   Member States may require the information to be supplied pursuant to Annex I, Part 2 to be in their official language(s) when the product reaches the end-user.\nMember States shall also authorise the provision of this information in one or more other official languages of the institutions of the European Union.\nWhen applying the first subparagraph, Member States shall take into account in particular:\n(a)\nwhether the information can be supplied by harmonised symbols or recognised codes or other measures; and\n(b)\nthe type of user anticipated for the product and the nature of the information which is to be provided.\nArticle 6\nFree movement\n1.   Member States shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market and/or putting into service, within their territories, of a product that complies with all the relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure and bears the CE marking in accordance with Article 5 on grounds of ecodesign requirements relating to those ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1 which are covered by the applicable implementing measure.\n2.   Member States shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market and/or putting into service, within their territories, of a product bearing the CE marking in accordance with Article 5 on grounds of ecodesign requirements relating to those ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1 for which the applicable implementing measure provides that no ecodesign requirement is necessary.\n3.   Member States shall not prevent the display, for example at trade fairs, exhibitions and demonstrations, of products which are not in conformity with the provisions of the applicable implementing measure, provided that there is a visible indication that they may not be placed on the market and/or put into service until brought into conformity.\nArticle 7\nSafeguard clause\n1.   Where a Member State ascertains that a product bearing the CE marking referred to in Article 5 and used in accordance with its intended use does not comply with all the relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure, the manufacturer or its authorised representative shall be obliged to make the product comply with the provisions of the applicable implementing measure and/or with the CE marking and to end the infringement under conditions imposed by the Member State.\nWhere there is sufficient evidence that a product might be non-compliant, the Member State shall take the necessary measures which, depending on the gravity of the non-compliance, can go as far as the prohibition of the placing on the market of the product until compliance is established.\nWhere non-compliance continues, the Member State shall take a decision restricting or prohibiting the placing on the market and/or putting into service of the product in question or ensure that it is withdrawn from the market.\nIn cases of prohibition or withdrawal from the market, the Commission and the other Member States shall be immediately informed thereof.\n2.   Any decision by a Member State pursuant to this Directive which restricts or prohibits the placing on the market and/or the putting into service of a product shall state the grounds on which it is based.\nSuch decision shall be notified forthwith to the party concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the legal remedies available under the laws in force in the Member State concerned and of the time limits to which such remedies are subject.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of any decision taken pursuant to paragraph 1, indicating the reasons therefor, and, in particular, whether non-compliance is due to:\n(a)\nfailure to satisfy the requirements of the applicable implementing measure;\n(b)\nthe incorrect application of harmonised standards as referred to in Article 10(2);\n(c)\nshortcomings in harmonised standards as referred to in Article 10(2).\n4.

Where the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is based on a shortcoming in a harmonised standard, the Commission shall immediately initiate the procedure set out in Article 10(2), (3) and (4). The Commission shall at the same time inform the Committee referred to in Article 19(1).\n6.   The Member States and the Commission shall take the necessary measures to guarantee confidentiality with regard to information provided during that procedure, where justified.\n7.   The decisions taken by Member States pursuant to this Article shall be made public in a transparent way.\n8.   The Commission’s opinion on those decisions shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 8\nConformity assessment\n1.   Before placing a product covered by implementing measures on the market and/or putting such a product into service, the manufacturer or its authorised representative shall ensure that an assessment of the product’s conformity with all the relevant requirements of the applicable implementing measure is carried out.\n2.   The conformity assessment procedures shall be specified by the implementing measures and shall leave to manufacturers the choice between the internal design control set out in Annex IV to this Directive and the management system set out in Annex V to this Directive. Where duly justified and proportionate to the risk, the conformity assessment procedure shall be specified among relevant modules as described in Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC.\nWhere a Member State has strong indications of probable non-compliance of a product, that Member State shall as soon as possible publish a substantiated assessment of the product’s compliance which may be conducted by a competent body in order to allow, if appropriate, for timely corrective action.\nWhere a product covered by implementing measures is designed by an organisation registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) (23) and the design function is included within the scope of that registration, the management system of that organisation shall be presumed to comply with the requirements of Annex V to this Directive.\nIf a product covered by implementing measures is designed by an organisation having a management system which includes the product design function and which is implemented in accordance with harmonised standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, that management system shall be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements of Annex V.\n3.   After placing a product covered by implementing measures on the market and/or putting it into service, the manufacturer or its authorised representative shall keep relevant documents relating to the conformity assessment performed and declarations of conformity issued available for inspection by Member States for a period of 10 years after the last of that product has been manufactured.\nThe relevant documents shall be made available within 10 days of receipt of a request by the competent authority of a Member State.\n4.   Documents relating to the conformity assessment and the EC declaration of conformity referred to in Article 5 shall be drawn up in one of the official languages of the institutions of the European Union.\nArticle 9\nPresumption of conformity\n1.   Member States shall regard a product bearing the CE marking referred to in Article 5 as conforming to the relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure.\n2.   Member States shall regard a product for which harmonised standards have been applied, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, as conforming to all the relevant requirements of the applicable implementing measure to which such standards relate.\n3.   Products which have been awarded the Community Ecolabel pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 shall be presumed to comply with the ecodesign requirements of the applicable implementing measure in so far as those requirements are met by the ecolabel.\n4.   For the purposes of the presumption of conformity in the context of this Directive, the Commission, acting in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 19(2), may decide that other ecolabels fulfil equivalent conditions to the Community Ecolabel pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000. Products which have been awarded such other ecolabels shall be presumed to comply with the ecodesign requirements of the applicable implementing measure, in so far as those requirements are met by that ecolabel.\nArticle 10\nHarmonised standards\n1.   Member States shall, as far as possible, ensure that appropriate measures are taken to enable interested parties to be consulted at national level on the process of preparing and monitoring harmonised standards.\n2.   Where a Member State or the Commission considers that harmonised standards the application of which is presumed to satisfy specific provisions of an applicable implementing measure do not entirely satisfy those provisions, the Member State concerned or the Commission shall inform the Standing Committee set up under Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC to that effect, indicating the reasons therefor. The Committee shall issue an opinion as a matter of urgency.\n3.   In the light of that Committee’s opinion, the Commission shall decide whether to publish, not to publish, to publish with restriction, to maintain or to withdraw the references to the harmonised standards concerned in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n4.   The Commission shall inform the European standardisation body concerned and, if necessary, issue a new mandate with a view to revising the harmonised standards concerned.\nArticle 11\nRequirements for components and sub-assemblies\nImplementing measures may require a manufacturer or its authorised representative placing components and sub-assemblies on the market and/or putting them into service to provide the manufacturer of a product covered by implementing measures with relevant information on the material composition and the consumption of energy, materials and/or resources of the components or sub-assemblies.\nArticle 12\nAdministrative cooperation and exchange of information\n1.

The method referred to in this Annex must be applied when it is not appropriate to set limit values for the product group under examination. The Commission must, when preparing a draft implementing measure to be submitted to the Committee referred to in Article 19(1), identify significant environmental aspects which must be specified in the implementing measure.\nIn preparing implementing measures laying down generic ecodesign requirements pursuant to Article 15, the Commission must identify, as appropriate to the product covered by the implementing measure, the relevant ecodesign parameters from among those listed in Part 1, the information supply requirements from among those listed in Part 2 and the requirements for the manufacturer listed in Part 3.\nPart 1.   Ecodesign parameters for products\n1.1.\nIn so far as they relate to product design, significant environmental aspects must be identified with reference to the following phases of the life cycle of the product:\n(a)\nraw material selection and use;\n(b)\nmanufacturing;\n(c)\npackaging, transport, and distribution;\n(d)\ninstallation and maintenance;\n(e)\nuse; and\n(f)\nend-of-life, meaning the state of a product having reached the end of its first use until its final disposal.\n1.2.\nFor each phase, the following environmental aspects must be assessed where relevant:\n(a)\npredicted consumption of materials, of energy and of other resources such as fresh water;\n(b)\nanticipated emissions to air, water or soil;\n(c)\nanticipated pollution through physical effects such as noise, vibration, radiation, electromagnetic fields;\n(d)\nexpected generation of waste material; and\n(e)\npossibilities for reuse, recycling and recovery of materials and/or of energy, taking into account Directive 2002/96/EC.\n1.3.\nIn particular, the following parameters must be used, as appropriate, and supplemented by others, where necessary, for evaluating the potential for improving the environmental aspects referred to in point 1.2:\n(a)\nweight and volume of the product;\n(b)\nuse of materials issued from recycling activities;\n(c)\nconsumption of energy, water and other resources throughout the life cycle;\n(d)\nuse of substances classified as hazardous to health and/or the environment according to Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (1) and taking into account legislation on the marketing and use of specific substances, such as Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (2) or Directive 2002/95/EC;\n(e)\nquantity and nature of consumables needed for proper use and maintenance;\n(f)\nease for reuse and recycling as expressed through: number of materials and components used, use of standard components, time necessary for disassembly, complexity of tools necessary for disassembly, use of component and material coding standards for the identification of components and materials suitable for reuse and recycling (including marking of plastic parts in accordance with ISO standards), use of easily recyclable materials, easy access to valuable and other recyclable components and materials; easy access to components and materials containing hazardous substances;\n(g)\nincorporation of used components;\n(h)\navoidance of technical solutions detrimental to reuse and recycling of components and whole appliances;\n(i)\nextension of lifetime as expressed through: minimum guaranteed lifetime, minimum time for availability of spare parts, modularity, upgradeability, reparability;\n(j)\namounts of waste generated and amounts of hazardous waste generated;\n(k)\nemissions to air (greenhouse gases, acidifying agents, volatile organic compounds, ozone depleting substances, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, fine particulate and suspended particulate matter) without prejudice to Directive 97/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery (3);\n(l)\nemissions to water (heavy metals, substances with an adverse effect on the oxygen balance, persistent organic pollutants); and\n(m)\nemissions to soil (especially leakage and spills of dangerous substances during the use phase of the product, and the potential for leaching upon its disposal as waste).\nPart 2.   Requirements relating to the supply of information\nImplementing measures may require information to be supplied by the manufacturer that may influence the way the product is handled, used or recycled by parties other than the manufacturer. This information may include, as applicable:\n(a)\ninformation from the designer relating to the manufacturing process;\n(b)\ninformation for consumers on the significant environmental characteristics and performance of a product, accompanying the product when it is placed on the market to allow consumers to compare these aspects of the products;\n(c)\ninformation for consumers on how to install, use and maintain the product in order to minimise its impact on the environment and to ensure optimal life expectancy, as well as on how to return the product at end-of-life, and, where appropriate, information on the period of availability of spare parts and the possibilities of upgrading products; and\n(d)\ninformation for treatment facilities concerning disassembly, recycling, or disposal at end-of-life.\nInformation should be given on the product itself wherever possible.\nThis information must take into account obligations under other Community legislation, such as Directive 2002/96/EC.\nPart 3.   Requirements for the manufacturer\n1.\nAddressing the environmental aspects identified in the implementing measure as capable of being influenced in a substantial manner through product design, manufacturers of products must perform an assessment of the product model throughout its lifecycle, based upon realistic assumptions about normal conditions and purposes of use. Other environmental aspects may be examined on a voluntary basis.\nOn the basis of this assessment, manufacturers must establish the product's ecological profile. It must be based on environmentally relevant product characteristics and inputs/outputs throughout the product life cycle expressed in physical quantities that can be measured.\n2.\nManufacturers must make use of this assessment to evaluate alternative design solutions and the achieved environmental performance of the product against benchmarks.\nThe benchmarks must be identified by the Commission in the implementing measure on the basis of information gathered during the preparation of the measure.\nThe choice of a specific design solution must achieve a reasonable balance between the various environmental aspects and between environmental aspects and other relevant considerations, such as safety and health, technical requirements for functionality, quality, and performance, and economic aspects, including manufacturing costs and marketability, while complying with all relevant legislation.\n(1)  OJ 196, 16.8.1967, p. 1.\n(2)  OJ L 262, 27.9.1976, p. 201.\n(3)  OJ L 59, 27.2.1998, p. 1.\nANNEX II\nMethod for setting specific ecodesign requirements\n(referred to in Article 15(6))\nSpecific ecodesign requirements aim at improving a selected environmental aspect of the product. They may take the form of requirements for reduced consumption of a given resource, such as a limit on the use of a resource in the various stages of an product’s life cycle, as appropriate (such as a limit on water consumption in the use phase or on the quantities of a given material incorporated in the product or a requirement for minimum quantities of recycled material).\nIn preparing implementing measures laying down specific ecodesign requirements pursuant to Article 15, the Commission must identify, as appropriate to the product covered by the implementing measure, the relevant ecodesign parameters from among those referred to in Annex I, Part 1, and set the levels of these requirements, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 19(2), as follows:\n1.\nA technical, environmental and economic analysis must select a number of representative models of the product in question on the market and identify the technical options for improving the environmental performance of the product, keeping sight of the economic viability of the options and avoiding any significant loss of performance or of usefulness for consumers.\nThe technical, environmental and economic analysis must also identify, for the environmental aspects under consideration, the best-performing products and technology available on the market.\nThe performance of products available on international markets and benchmarks set in other countries’ legislation should be taken into consideration during the analysis as well as when setting requirements.\nOn the basis of this analysis, and taking into account economic and technical feasibility as well as the potential for improvement, concrete measures must be taken with a view to minimising the product’s environmental impact.\nConcerning energy consumption in use, the level of energy efficiency or consumption must be set aiming at the life cycle cost minimum to end-users for representative product models, taking into account the consequences on other environmental aspects. The life cycle cost analysis method uses a real discount rate on the basis of data provided from the European Central Bank and a realistic lifetime for the product; it is based on the sum of the variations in purchase price (resulting from the variations in industrial costs) and in operating expenses, which result from the different levels of technical improvement options, discounted over the lifetime of the representative product models considered. The operating expenses cover primarily energy consumption and additional expenses in other resources, such as water or detergents.\nA sensitivity analysis covering the relevant factors, such as the price of energy or other resource, the cost of raw materials or production costs, discount rates, and, where appropriate, external environmental costs, including avoided greenhouse gas emissions, must be carried out to check if there are significant changes and if the overall conclusions are reliable. The requirement will be adapted accordingly.\nA similar methodology may be applied to other resources such as water.\n2.\nFor the development of the technical, environmental and economic analyses, information available in the framework of other Community activities may be used.\nThe same applies for information available from existing programmes applied in other parts of the world for setting the specific ecodesign requirement of products traded with the European Union’s economic partners.\n3.\nThe date of entry into force of the requirement must take the redesign cycle for the product into account.\nANNEX III\nCE marking\n(referred to in Article 5(2))\nThe CE marking must have a height of at least 5 mm. If the CE marking is reduced or enlarged the proportions given in the above graduated drawing must be respected.\nThe CE marking must be affixed to the product. Where this is not possible, it must be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents.\nANNEX IV\nInternal design control\n(referred to in Article 8(2))\n1.\nThis Annex describes the procedure whereby the manufacturer or its authorised representative who carries out the obligations laid down in point 2 ensures and declares that the product satisfies the relevant requirements of the applicable implementing measure. The EC declaration of conformity may cover one or more products and must be kept by the manufacturer.\n2.\nA technical documentation file making possible an assessment of the conformity of the product with the requirements of the applicable implementing measure must be compiled by the manufacturer.\nThe documentation must contain, in particular:\n(a)\na general description of the product and of its intended use;\n(b)\nthe results of relevant environmental assessment studies carried out by the manufacturer, and/or references to environmental assessment literature or case studies, which are used by the manufacturer in evaluating, documenting and determining product design solutions;\n(c)\nthe ecological profile, where required by the implementing measure;\n(d)\nelements of the product design specification relating to environmental design aspects of the product;\n(e)\na list of the appropriate standards referred to in Article 10, applied in full or in part, and a description of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements of the applicable implementing measure where the standards referred to in Article 10 have not been applied or where those standards do not cover entirely the requirements of the applicable implementing measure;\n(f)\na copy of the information concerning the environmental design aspects of the product provided in accordance with the requirements specified in Annex I, Part 2; and\n(g)\nthe results of measurements on the ecodesign requirements carried out, including details of the conformity of these measurements as compared with the ecodesign requirements set out in the applicable implementing measure.\n3.\nThe manufacturer must take all measures necessary to ensure that the product is manufactured in compliance with the design specifications referred to in point 2 and with the requirements of the measure which apply to it.\nANNEX V\nManagement system for assessing conformity\n(referred to in Article 8(2))\n1.   This Annex describes the procedure whereby the manufacturer who satisfies the obligations of point 2 ensures and declares that the product satisfies the requirements of the applicable implementing measure. The EC declaration of conformity may cover one or more products and must be kept by the manufacturer.\n2.   A management system may be used for the conformity assessment of a product provided that the manufacturer implements the environmental elements specified in point 3.\n3.   Environmental elements of the management system\nThis point specifies the elements of a management system and the procedures by which the manufacturer can demonstrate that the product complies with the requirements of the applicable implementing measure.\n3.1.   The environmental product performance policy\nThe manufacturer must be able to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of the applicable implementing measure. The manufacturer must also be able to provide a framework for setting and reviewing environmental product performance objectives and indicators with a view to improving the overall environmental product performance.\nAll the measures adopted by the manufacturer to improve the overall environmental performance of, and to establish the ecological profile of, a product, if required by the implementing measure, through design and manufacturing, must be documented in a systematic and orderly manner in the form of written procedures and instructions.\nThese procedures and instructions must contain, in particular, an adequate description of:\n(a)\nthe list of documents that must be prepared to demonstrate the product’s conformity, and, if relevant, that have to be made available;\n(b)\nthe environmental product performance objectives and indicators and the organisational structure, responsibilities, powers of the management and the allocation of resources with regard to their implementation and maintenance;\n(c)\nthe checks and tests to be carried out after manufacture to verify product performance against environmental performance indicators;\n(d)\nthe procedures for controlling the required documentation and ensuring that it is kept up-to-date; and\n(e)\nthe method of verifying the implementation and effectiveness of the environmental elements of the management system.\n3.2.

Checking and corrective action\n3.4.1.\nThe manufacturer must:\n(a)\ntake all measures necessary to ensure that the product is manufactured in compliance with its design specification and with the requirements of the implementing measure which applies to it;\n(b)\nestablish and maintain procedures to investigate and respond to non-conformity, and implement changes in the documented procedures resulting from corrective action; and\n(c)\ncarry out at least every three years a full internal audit of the management system with regard to its environmental elements.\nANNEX VI\nEC declaration of conformity\n(referred to in Article 5(3))\nThe EC declaration of conformity must contain the following elements:\n1.\nthe name and address of the manufacturer or of its authorised representative;\n2.\na description of the model sufficient for its unambiguous identification;\n3.\nwhere appropriate, the references of the harmonised standards applied;\n4.\nwhere appropriate, the other technical standards and specifications used;\n5.\nwhere appropriate, the reference to other Community legislation providing for the affixing of the CE mark that is applied; and\n6.\nthe identification and signature of the person empowered to bind the manufacturer or its authorised representative.\nANNEX VII\nContents of the implementing measures\n(referred to in Article 15(8))\nThe implementing measure must specify, in particular:\n1.\nthe exact definition of the type(s) of product(s) covered;\n2.\nthe ecodesign requirement(s) for the product(s) covered, implementing date(s), staged or transitional measures or periods:\n(a)\nin the case of generic ecodesign requirement(s), the relevant phases and aspects selected from those mentioned in Annex I, points 1.1 and 1.2, accompanied by examples of parameters selected from those mentioned in Annex I, point 1.3 as guidance when evaluating improvements regarding identified environmental aspects;\n(b)\nin the case of specific ecodesign requirement(s), its (their) level(s);\n3.\nthe ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1 relating to which no ecodesign requirement is necessary;\n4.\nthe requirements on installation of the product where it has a direct relevance to the product’s environmental performance considered;\n5.\nthe measurement standards and/or measurement methods to be used; where available, harmonised standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, must be used;\n6.\nthe details for conformity assessment under Decision 93/465/EEC:\n(a)\nwhere the module(s) to be applied is (are) different from Module A, the factors leading to the selection of that specific procedure;\n(b)\nwhere relevant, the criteria for approval and/or certification of the third parties;\nWhere different modules are laid down in other CE requirements for the same product, the module defined in the implementing measure must prevail for the requirement concerned;\n7.\nrequirements on information to be provided by manufacturers notably on the elements of the technical documentation which are needed to facilitate the checking of the compliance of the product with the implementing measure;\n8.\nthe duration of the transitional period during which Member States must permit the placing on the market and/or putting into service of products which comply with the regulations in force in their territory on the date of adoption of the implementing measure;\n9.\nthe date for the evaluation and possible revision of the implementing measure, taking into account the speed of technological progress.\nANNEX VIII\nSelf-regulation\n(referred to in Article 17)\nIn addition to the basic legal requirement that self-regulatory initiatives must comply with all provisions of the Treaty (in particular internal market and competition rules), as well as with the international engagements of the Community, including multilateral trade rules, the following non-exhaustive list of indicative criteria may be used to evaluate the admissibility of self-regulatory initiatives as an alternative to an implementing measure in the context of this Directive:\n1.   Openness of participation\nSelf-regulatory initiatives must be open to the participation of third country operators, both in the preparatory and in the implementation phases.\n2.   Added value\nSelf-regulatory initiatives must deliver added value (more than ‘business as usual’) in terms of the improved overall environmental performance of the product covered.\n3.   Representativeness\nIndustry and their associations taking part in a self-regulatory action must represent a large majority of the relevant economic sector, with as few exceptions as possible. Care must be taken to ensure respect for competition rules.\n4.   Quantified and staged objectives\nThe objectives defined by the stakeholders must be set in clear and unambiguous terms, starting from a well-defined baseline. If the self-regulatory initiative covers a long time-span, interim targets must be included. It must be possible to monitor compliance with objectives and (interim) targets in an affordable and credible way using clear and reliable indicators. Research information and scientific and technological background data must facilitate the development of these indicators.\n5.   Involvement of civil society\nWith a view to ensuring transparency, self-regulatory initiatives must be publicised, including through the use of the Internet and other electronic means of disseminating information.\nThe same must apply to interim and final monitoring reports. Stakeholders including Member States, industry, environmental NGOs and consumers’ associations must be invited to comment on a self-regulatory initiative.\n6.   Monitoring and reporting\nSelf-regulatory initiatives must contain a well-designed monitoring system, with clearly identified responsibilities for industry and independent inspectors. The Commission services, in partnership with the parties to the self-regulatory initiative, must be invited to monitor the achievement of the objectives.\nThe plan for monitoring and reporting must be detailed, transparent and objective. It must remain for the Commission services, assisted by the Committee referred to in Article 19(1), to consider whether the objectives of the voluntary agreement or other self-regulatory measures have been met.\n7.   Cost-effectiveness of administering a self-regulatory initiative\nThe cost of administering self-regulatory initiatives, in particular as regards monitoring, must not lead to a disproportionate administrative burden, as compared to their objectives and to other available policy instruments.\n8.   Sustainability\nSelf-regulatory initiatives must respond to the policy objectives of this Directive, including the integrated approach, and must be consistent with the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development. The protection of the interests of consumers, health, quality of life and economic interests, must be integrated.\n9.   Incentive compatibility\nSelf-regulatory initiatives are unlikely to deliver the expected results if other factors and incentives — market pressure, taxes, and legislation at national level — send contradictory signals to participants in the self-regulatory initiative. Policy consistency is essential in this regard and must be taken into consideration when assessing the effectiveness of the initiative.\nANNEX IX\nPART A\nRepealed Directive with list of its successive amendments\n(referred to in Article 24)\nDirective 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(OJ L 191, 22.7.2005, p. 29)\nDirective 2008/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(OJ L 81, 20.3.2008, p. 48)\nonly Article 1\nPART B\nList of time limits for transposition into national law\n(referred to in Article 24)\nDirective\nDeadline for transposition\n2005/32/EC\n11 August 2007\n2008/28/EC\n—\nANNEX X\nCorrelation table\nDirective 2005/32/EC\nThis Directive\nArticles 1 to 20\nArticles 1 to 20\nArticle 21\n—\nArticle 22\n—\nArticle 23\nArticle 21\nArticle 24\nArticle 22\nArticle 25\n—\n—\nArticle 23\n—\nArticle 24\nArticle 26\nArticle 25\nArticle 27\nArticle 26\nAnnexes I to VIII\nAnnexes I to VIII\n—\nAnnex IX\n—\nAnnex X", "summary": "Eco-design for energy-using appliances\nEco-design for energy-using appliances\nEstablishing an EU-wide legal methodology for the eco-design* of energy-related products is efficient and consistent and prevents duplication or differences with voluntary or regulatory national initiatives.\nACT\n                  \nDirective 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy-related products\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE DO?\n                     \nIt establishes a framework for minimum eco-design requirements which goods that consume energy must meet before they can be used or sold in the EU. It does not apply to transport used to carry people or goods.\nKEY POINTS\nEco-design requirements cover all stages of a product’s life: from raw materials, manufacturing, packaging and distribution to installation, maintenance, use and end-of life.\nFor each phase, various environmental aspects are assessed by bodies designated by EU countries. They verify aspects such as the materials and energy consumed, expected emissions and waste and possibilities for reuse, recycling and recovery.\nManufacturers must construct an ecological profile* of their products and use this to consider alternative design possibilities.\nProducts which satisfy the requirements bear the CE marking and may be sold anywhere in the EU.\nDirective 2012/27/EU amended the 2009 legislation to further promote energy efficiency*. It requires national authorities to do the following.\nEstablish an indicative national energy efficiency target.\nApprove a long-term strategy to renovate residential and commercial buildings.\nRenovate, from 1 January 2014, 3 % of the total floor area of government-owned buildings.\nIntroduce energy efficiency obligation schemes to achieve an annual 1.5 % energy saving* by final customers between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020.\nSubmit large enterprises to an independent energy audit from 2016.\nEnsure customers are billed on their actual consumption at least once a year.\nInform the Commission, by 31 December 2015, of the potential for efficient co-generation* and district heating and cooling*.\nSee also:\nenergy-efficient products on the European Commission’s website;\neco-design and energy labelling on the European Commission’s website.\nKEY TERMS\n*Eco-design: the integration of environmental aspects into product design with the aim of improving the environmental performance of the product throughout its whole life cycle.\n*Ecological profile: a description of the inputs and outputs (such as materials, emissions and waste) associated with a product throughout its life cycle which are significant from the point of view of their environmental impact. These inputs and outputs are expressed in physical quantities that can be measured.\n*Energy efficiency: using less energy to provide the same service. Examples in terms of products are: energy-efficient fridges and washing machines.\n*Energy saving: reducing or going without a service to save energy. Example: turning off a light.\n*Co-generation: the simultaneous production of electricity and heat, both of which are used.\n*District heating: a heating network that enables energy, which is often wasted in power generation or industrial processes, to be harnessed and delivered to a point of use.\n*District cooling: the centralised production and distribution of cooling energy. The cold water pumped around the district cooling network is used to cool the air circulating in ventilation systems. The water is then fed back to the production plant to be cooled again.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nTransposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2009/125/EC\n20.11.2009\n20.11.2010\nOJ L 285, 31.10.2009, pp. 10-35\nAmending act\nEntry into force\nTransposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2012/27/EU\n4.12.2012\n5.6.2014\nOJ L 315, 14.11.2012, pp. 1-56\nlast update 25.08.2015", "tags": ["marketing", "energy consumption", "approximation of laws", "environmental impact", "EC conformity marking", "energy saving"], "subjects": ["Environment", "Approximation of laws", "Energy", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32009L0125_p1": {"text": "This Directive is complementary to existing Community instruments such as Council directive 92/75/eec of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances (9), regulation 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme (10), directive 2002/96/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (11), directive 2002/95/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (12), directive 2006/121/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 amending Council directive 67/548/eec on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances in order to adapt it to regulation 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and establishing a European Chemicals Agency (13) and regulation 106/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (14).
