For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\na ‘semiconductor product’ shall mean the final or an intermediate form of any product:\n(i)\nconsisting of a body of material which includes a layer of semiconducting material; and\n(ii)\nhaving one or more other layers composed of conducting, insulating or semiconducting material, the layers being arranged in accordance with a predetermined three-dimensional pattern; and\n(iii)\nintended to perform, exclusively or together with other functions, an electronic function;\n(b)\nthe ‘topography’ of a semiconductor product shall mean a series of related images, however fixed or encoded;\n(i)\nrepresenting the three-dimensional pattern of the layers of which a semiconductor product is composed; and\n(ii)\nin which series, each image has the pattern or part of the pattern of a surface of the semiconductor product at any stage of its manufacture;\n(c)\n‘commercial exploitation’ means the sale, rental, leasing or any other method of commercial distribution, or an offer for these purposes. However, for the purposes of Articles 3 (4), 4 (1), 7 (1), (3) and (4) ‘commercial exploitation’ shall not include exploitation under conditions of confidentiality to the extent that no further distribution to third parties occurs, except where exploitation of a topography takes place under conditions of confidentiality required by a measure taken in conformity with Article 223 (1) (b) of the Treaty.\n2.   The Council acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may amend paragraph 1 (a) (i) and (ii) in order to adapt these provisions in the light of technical progress.\nCHAPTER 2\nProtection of topographies of semiconductor products\nArticle 2\n1.   Member States shall protect the topographies of semiconductor products by adopting legislative provisions conferring exclusive rights in accordance with the provisions of the Directive.\n2.   The topography of a semiconductor product shall be protected in so far as it satisfies the conditions that it is the result of its creator's own intellectual effort and is not commonplace in the semiconductor industry. Where the topography of a semiconductor product consists of elements that are commonplace in the semiconductor industry, it shall be protected only to the extent that the combination of such elements, taken as a whole, fulfils the abovementioned conditions.\nArticle 3\n1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 to 5, the right to protection shall apply in favour of persons who are the creators of the topographies of semiconductor products.\n2.   Member States may provide that,\n(a)\nwhere a topography is created in the course of the creator's employment, the right to protection shall apply in favour of the creator's employer unless the terms of employment provide to the contrary;\n(b)\nwhere a topography is created under a contract other than a contract of employment, the right to protection shall apply in favour of a party to the contract by whom the topography has been commissioned, unless the contract provides to the contrary.\n3.\n(a)\nAs regards the persons referred to in paragraph 1, the right to protection shall apply in favour of natural persons who are nationals of a Member State or who have their habitual residence on the territory of a Member State.\n(b)\nWhere Member States make provision in accordance with paragraph 2, the right to protection shall apply in favour of:\n(i)\nnatural persons who are nationals of a Member State or who have their habitual residence on the territory of a Member State;\n(ii)\ncompanies or other legal persons which have a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment on the territory of a Member State.\n4.   Where no right to protection exists in accordance with other provisions of this Article, the right to protection shall also apply in favour of the persons referred to in paragraph 3 (b) (i) and (ii) who:\n(a)\nfirst commercially exploit within a Member State a topography which has not yet been exploited commercially anywhere in the world; and\n(b)\nhave been exclusively authorized to exploit commercially the topography throughout the Community by the person entitled to dispose of it.\n5.   The right to protection shall also apply in favour of the successors in title of the persons mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 4.\n6.   Subject to paragraph 7, Member States may negotiate and conclude agreements or understandings with third States and multilateral Conventions concerning the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products whilst respecting Community law and in particular the rules laid down in this Directive.\n7.   Member States may enter into negotiations which third States with a view to extending the right to protection to persons who do not benefit from the right to protection according to the provisions of this Directive. Member States who enter into such negotiations shall inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen a Member State wishes to extend protection to persons who otherwise do not benefit from the right to protection according to the provisions of this Directive or to conclude an agreement or understanding on the extension of protection with a non-Member State it shall notify the Commission. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof.\nThe Member State shall hold the extension of protection or the conclusion of the agreement or understanding in abeyance for one month from the date on which it notifies the Commission. However, if within that period the Commission notifies the Member State concerned of its intention to submit a proposal to the Council for all Member States to extend protection in respect of the persons or non-Member State concerned, the Member State shall hold the extension of protection or the conclusion of the agreement or undestanding in abeyance for a period of two months from the date of the notification by the Member State.\nWhere, before the end of this two-month period, the Commission submits such a proposal to the Council, the Member State shall hold the extension of protection or the conclusion of the agreement or understanding in abeyance for a further period of four months from the date on which the proposal was submitted.\nIn the absence of a Commission notification or proposal or a Council decision within the time limits prescribed above, the Member State may extend protection or conclude the agreement or understanding.\nA proposal by the Commission to extend protection, whether or not it is made following a notification by a Member State in accordance with the preceding paragraphs shall be adopted by the Council acting by qualified majority.\nA Decision of the Council on the basis of a Commission proposal shall not prevent a Member State from extending protection to persons, in addition to those to benefit from protection in all Member States, who were included in the envisaged extension, agreement or understanding as notified, unless the Council acting by qualified majority has decided otherwise.\n8.   Commission proposals and Council decisions pursuant to paragraph 7 shall be published for information in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nArticle 4\n1.   Member States may provide that the exclusive rights conferred in conformity with Article 2 shall not come into existence or shall no longer apply to the topography of a semiconductor product unless an application for registration in due form has been filed with a public authority within two years of its first commercial exploitation. Member States may require in addition to such registration that material identifying or exemplifying the topography or any combination thereof has been deposited with a public authority, as well as a statement as to the date of first commercial exploitation of the topography where it precedes the date of the applciation for registration.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that material deposited in conformity with paragraph 1 is not made available to the public where it is a trade secret. This provision shall be without prejudice to the disclosure of such material pursuant to an order of a court or other competent authority to persons involved in litigation concerning the validity or infringement of the excusive rights referred to in Article 2.\n3.   Member States may require that transfers of rights in protected topographies be registered.\n4.   Member States may subject registration and deposit in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3 to the payment of fees not exceeding their administrative costs.\n5.   Conditions prescribing the fulfilment of additional formalities for obtaining or maintaining protection shall not be admitted.\n6.   Member States which require registration shall provide for legal remedies in favour of a person having the right to protection in accordance with the provisions of this Directive who can prove that another person has applied for or obtained the registration of a topography without his authorization.\nArticle 5\n1.   The exclusive rights referred to in Article 2 shall include the rights to authorize or prohibit any of the following acts:\n(a)\nreproduction of a topography in so far as it is protected under Article 2 (2);\n(b)\ncommercial exploitation or the importation for that purpose of a topography or of a semiconductor product manufactured by using the topography.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Member State pay permit the reproduction of a topography privately for non commercial aims.\n3.   The exclusive rights referred to in paragraph 1 (a) shall not apply to reproduction for the purpose of analyzing, evaluating or teaching the concepts, processes, systems or techniques embodied in the topography or the topography itself.\n4.   The exclusive rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall not extend to any such act in relation to a topography meeting the requirements of Article 2 (2) and created on the basis of an analysis and evaluation of another topography, carried out in conformity with paragraph 3.\n5.   The exclusive rights to authorize or prohibit the acts specified in paragraph 1 (b) shall not apply to any such act committed after the topography or the semiconductor product has been put on the market in a Member State by the person entitled to authorize its marketing or with his consent.\n6.   A person who, when he acquires a semiconductor product, does not know, or has no reasonable grounds to believe, that the product is protected by an exclusive right conferred by a Member State in conformity with this Directive shall not be prevented from commercially exploiting that product.\nHowever, for acts committed after that person knows, or has reasonable grounds to believe, that the semiconductor product is so protected, Member States shall ensure that on the demand of the rightholder a tribunal may require, in accordance with the provisions of the national law applicable, the payment of adequate remuneration.\n7.   The provisions of paragraph 6 shall apply to the successors in title of the person referred to in the first sentence of that paragraph.\nArticle 6\nMember States shall not subject the exclusive rights referred to in Article 2 to licences granted, for the sole reason that a certain period of time has elapsed, automatically, and by operation of law.\nArticle 7\n1.   Member States shall provide that the exclusive rights referred to in Article 2 shall come into existence:\n(a)\nwhere registration is the condition for the coming into existence of the exclusive rights in accordance with Article 4, on the earlier of the following dates:\n(i)\nthe date when the topography is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world;\n(ii)\nthe date when an application or registration has been filed in due form; or\n(b)\nwhen the topography is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world; or\n(c)\nwhen the topography is first fixed or encoded.\n2.   Where the exclusive rights come into existence in accordance with paragraph 1 (a) or (b), the Member States shall provide, for the period prior to those rights coming into existence, legal remedies in favour of a person having the right to protection in accordance with the provisions of this Directive who can prove that another person has fraudulently reproduced or commercially exploited or imported for that purpose a topography. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to legal remedies made available to enforce the exclusive rights conferred in conformity with Article 2.\n3.   The exclusive rights shall come to an end 10 years from the end of the calendar year in which the topography is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world or, where registration is a condition for the coming into existence or continuing application of the exclusive rights, 10 years from the earlier of the following dates:\n(a)\nthe end of the calendar year in which the topography is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world;\n(b)\nthe end of the calendar year in which the application for registration has been filed in due form.\n4.   Where a topography has not been commercially exploited anywhere in the world within a period of 15 years from its first fixation or encoding, any exclusive rights in existence pursuant to paragraph 1 shall come to an end and no new exclusive rights shall come into existence unless an application for registration in due form has been filed within that period in those Member States where registration is a condition for the coming into existence or continuing application of the exclusive rights.\nArticle 8\nThe protection granted to the topographies of semiconductor products in accordance with Article 2 shall not extend to any concept, process, system, technique or encoded information embodied in the topography other than the topography itself.\nArticle 9\nWhere the legislation of Member States provides that semiconductor products manufactured using protected topographies may carry an indication, the indication to be used shall be a capital T as follows: T, ‘T’ [T],   , T* or   .\nCHAPTER 3\nContinued application of other legal provisions\nArticle 10\n1.   The provisions of this Directive shall be without prejudice to legal provisions concerning patent and utility model rights.\n2.

Where the elements of the topography of a semiconductor product are commonplace within the industry, it can be protected only to the extent that the combination of such elements, taken as a whole, fulfils the above condition;\nmust grant the right to protection to the person who creates the topography, if that person is an individual who is a national of an EU country or ordinarily resident there. However, they may specify to whom the right is granted where a topography is created in the course of the creator’s employment or under a contract other than a contract of employment;\nmay, under certain conditions, grant protection to individuals, companies or other legal persons who first commercially exploit a topography: which has not previously been exploited commercially,who have been exclusively authorised to commercially exploit the topography throughout the EU by the person entitled to authorise it;\nmay enter negotiations with non-EU countries to extend the right to protection to persons not covered by the directive. Where they do so, they must inform the European Commission;\nmay refuse or remove protection in respect of the topography of a semiconductor product where an application for registration in due form has not been filed with a public authority within 2 years of its being commercially exploited for the first time;\nmay require that material identifying or exemplifying the topography be deposited with public authorities. However, this material must not be made publicly available where it is a trade secret.\nExclusive rights\nThe rights granted are exclusive rights. These include:\nthe right to authorise or prohibit reproduction of a protected topography; and\nthe right to authorise or prohibit commercial exploitation or the import for that purpose of a topography or of a semiconductor product manufactured using the topography.\nThe exclusive right to authorise or prohibit reproduction does not apply to reproduction:\nfor private purposes for non-commercial aims;\nfor the purpose of analysing, evaluating or teaching the concepts, processes, systems or techniques embodied in the topography or the topography itself.\nThe protection granted to the topographies of semiconductor products does not extend to any concept, process, system, technique or encoded information embodied in the topography other than the topography itself.\nRegistration\nWhere registration of the topography is a condition for granting exclusive rights, those rights take effect either: on the date on which the application for registration is filed; oron the date on which the topography is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world, whichever comes first.\nWhere registration is not a condition for granting exclusive rights, the rights take effect when the topography is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world or when it is first fixed or encoded.\nExpiry of rights\nThe exclusive rights expire 10 years from the end of the calendar year in which the topography was first commercially exploited. Where registration is required, the 10-year period is calculated:\nfrom the end of the calendar year in which the application for registration was filed; or\nfrom the end of the calendar year in which the topography was first commercially exploited, whichever comes first.\nExtension of legal protection to non-EU countries\nLegal protection of topographies of semiconductor products has been extended to individuals, companies and other legal persons from:\nthe United States (Decision 93/16/EEC),\nCanada (Decision 94/700/EC),\na Member of the World Trade Organization (Decision 94/824/EC), and\nthe Isle of Man (Decision 96/644/EC).\nEnforcement of IPR\nRegulation (EU) No 608/2013 on customs enforcement of intellectual property rights, which repealed Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003, extended the list of protected rights to also include topographies of semiconductor products from 1 January 2014.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 23 December 1986 and had to become law in the EU countries by 7 November 1987.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nAt international level, within the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Washington Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits was adopted in 1989. It provides protection for the topographies of integrated circuits. Although the treaty has not entered into force, its content was incorporated by reference into the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (generally known as the TRIPS Agreement — see summary) signed under the World Trade Organization.\nFor more information, see:\nThe EU copyright legislation (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nTopography: in the case of a semiconductor product (see next key term), a series of related images, however fixed or encoded:representing the 3-dimensional pattern of the layers which make up a semiconductor product;each image in the series has the pattern, or part of the pattern, of a surface of the semiconductor product at any stage of its manufacture.\nSemi-conductor product: integrated circuits, also known as a microchips (or chips), are the final or intermediate form of any product:consisting of a body of material which includes a layer of semiconducting material; andhaving one or more other layers composed of conducting, insulating or semiconducting material, the layers being arranged in accordance with a predetermined 3-dimensional pattern; andintended to perform, exclusively or together with other functions, an electronic function.Chips are embedded in many consumer goods such as domestic appliances like washing machines or televisions, as well as in cars, mobile phones, computers, medical equipment and machines.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 87/54/EEC of 16 December 1986 on the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products (OJ L 24, 27.1.1987, pp. 36-40)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 608/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 concerning customs enforcement of intellectual property rights and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 (OJ L 181, 29.6.2013, pp. 15-34)\nAgreement on the European Economic Area — Annex XVII — Intellectual property — List provided for in Article 65 (2) (OJ L 1, 3.1.1994, pp. 482-483)\nEXTENSION OF THE PROTECTION TO NON-EU COUNTRIES\nCouncil Decision 96/644/EC of 11 November 1996 on the extension of the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products to persons from the Isle of Man (OJ L 293, 16.11.1996, pp. 18-19)\nCouncil Decision 94/824/EC of 22 December 1994 on the extension of the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products to persons from a Member of the World Trade Organization (OJ L 349, 31.12.1994, pp. 201-202)\nCouncil Decision 94/700/EC of 24 October 1994 on the extension of the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products to persons from Canada (OJ L 284, 1.11.1994, pp. 61-62)\nCouncil Decision 93/16/EEC of 21 December 1992 on the extension of the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products to persons from the United States of America and certain territories (OJ L 11, 19.1.1993, pp. 20-21)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 93/16/EEC have been incorporated into the original text.
