{"celex_id": "32007L0002", "reference": "25.4.2007\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 108/1\nDIRECTIVE 2007/2/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 14 March 2007\nestablishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 17 January 2007 (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCommunity policy on the environment must aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Community. Moreover, information, including spatial information, is needed for the formulation and implementation of this policy and other Community policies, which must integrate environmental protection requirements in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty. In order to bring about such integration, it is necessary to establish a measure of coordination between the users and providers of the information so that information and knowledge from different sectors can be combined.\n(2)\nThe Sixth Environment Action Programme adopted by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 (3) requires full consideration to be given to ensuring that the Community's environmental policy-making is undertaken in an integrated way, taking into account regional and local differences. A number of problems exist regarding the availability, quality, organisation, accessibility and sharing of spatial information needed in order to achieve the objectives set out in that programme.\n(3)\nThe problems regarding the availability, quality, organisation, accessibility and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policy and information themes and are experienced across the various levels of public authority. Solving these problems requires measures that address exchange, sharing, access and use of interoperable spatial data and spatial data services across the various levels of public authority and across different sectors. An infrastructure for spatial information in the Community should therefore be established.\n(4)\nThe Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (Inspire) should assist policy-making in relation to policies and activities that may have a direct or indirect impact on the environment.\n(5)\nInspire should be based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created by the Member States and that are made compatible with common implementing rules and are supplemented with measures at Community level. These measures should ensure that the infrastructures for spatial information created by the Member States are compatible and usable in a Community and transboundary context.\n(6)\nThe infrastructures for spatial information in the Member States should be designed to ensure that spatial data are stored, made available and maintained at the most appropriate level; that it is possible to combine spatial data from different sources across the Community in a consistent way and share them between several users and applications; that it is possible for spatial data collected at one level of public authority to be shared between other public authorities; that spatial data are made available under conditions which do not unduly restrict their extensive use; that it is easy to discover available spatial data, to evaluate their suitability for the purpose and to know the conditions applicable to their use.\n(7)\nThere is a degree of overlap between the spatial information covered by this Directive and the information covered by Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information (4). This Directive should be without prejudice to Directive 2003/4/EC.\n(8)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information (5), the objectives of which are complementary to those of this Directive.\n(9)\nThis directive should not affect the existence or ownership of public authorities' intellectual property rights.\n(10)\nThe establishment of INSPIRE will represent significant added value for — and will also benefit from — other Community initiatives such as Council Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 of 21 May 2002 setting up the Galileo Joint Undertaking (6) and the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council ‘Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES): Establishing a GMES capacity by 2008 — (Action Plan (2004 to 2008))’. Member States should consider using the data and services resulting from Galileo and GMES as they become available, in particular those related to the time and space references from Galileo.\n(11)\nMany initiatives are taken at national and Community level to collect, harmonise or organise the dissemination or use of spatial information. Such initiatives may be established by Community legislation, such as Commission Decision 2000/479/EC of 17 July 2000 on the implementation of a European pollutant emission register (EPER) according to Article 15 of Council Directive 96/61/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) (7) and Regulation (EC) No 2152/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest focus) (8), in the framework of Community funded programmes (for example Corine land cover, European Transport Policy Information System) or may emanate from initiatives taken at national or regional level. This Directive will not only complement such initiatives by providing a framework that will enable them to become interoperable, but it will also build upon existing experience and initiatives rather than duplicate the work that has already been done.\n(12)\nThis Directive should apply to spatial data held by or on behalf of public authorities and to the use of spatial data by public authorities in the performance of their public tasks. Subject to certain conditions, however, it should also apply to spatial data held by natural or legal persons other than public authorities, provided that those natural or legal persons request this.\n(13)\nThis Directive should not set requirements for the collection of new data, or for reporting such information to the Commission, since those matters are regulated by other legislation related to the environment.\n(14)\nThe implementation of the national infrastructures should be progressive and, accordingly, the spatial data themes covered by this Directive should be accorded different levels of priority. The implementation should take account of the extent to which spatial data are needed for a wide range of applications in various policy areas, of the priority of actions provided for under Community policies that need harmonised spatial data and of the progress already made by the harmonisation efforts undertaken in the Member States.\n(15)\nThe loss of time and resources in searching for existing spatial data or establishing whether they may be used for a particular purpose is a key obstacle to the full exploitation of the data available. Member States should therefore provide descriptions of available spatial data sets and services in the form of metadata.\n(16)\nSince the wide diversity of formats and structures in which spatial data are organised and accessed in the Community hampers the efficient formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Community legislation that directly or indirectly affect the environment, implementing measures should be provided for in order to facilitate the use of spatial data from different sources across the Member States. Those measures should be designed to make the spatial data sets interoperable, and Member States should ensure that any data or information needed for the purposes of achieving interoperability are available on conditions that do not restrict their use for that purpose. Implementing rules should be based, where possible, on international standards and should not result in excessive costs for Member States.\n(17)\nNetwork services are necessary for sharing spatial data between the various levels of public authority in the Community. Those network services should make it possible to discover, transform, view and download spatial data and to invoke spatial data and e-commerce services. The services of the network should work in accordance with commonly agreed specifications and minimum performance criteria in order to ensure the interoperability of the infrastructures established by the Member States. The network of services should also include the technical possibility to enable public authorities to make their spatial data sets and services available.\n(18)\nCertain spatial data sets and services relevant to Community policies that directly or indirectly affect the environment are held and operated by third parties. Member States should therefore offer third parties the possibility of contributing to the national infrastructures, provided that the cohesion and ease of use of the spatial data and spatial data services covered by those infrastructures is thereby not impaired.\n(19)\nExperience in the Member States has shown that it is important, for the successful implementation of an infrastructure for spatial information, that a minimum number of services be made available to the public free of charge. Member States should therefore make available, as a minimum and free of charge, the services for discovering and, subject to certain specific conditions, viewing spatial data sets.\n(20)\nIn order to assist the integration of the national infrastructures into Inspire, Member States should provide access to their infrastructures through a Community geo-portal operated by the Commission, as well as through any access points they themselves decide to operate.\n(21)\nIn order to make information from various levels of public authority available, Member States should remove the practical obstacles faced in that regard by public authorities at national, regional and local level when performing their public tasks that may have a direct or indirect impact on the environment.\n(22)\nPublic authorities need to have smooth access to relevant spatial data sets and services during the execution of their public tasks. Such access can be hindered if it depends on individual ad hoc negotiations between public authorities every time access is required. Member States should take the necessary measures to prevent such practical obstacles to the sharing of data, using for example prior agreements between public authorities.\n(23)\nWhere a public authority supplies another public authority in the same Member State with spatial data sets and services required for the fulfilment of reporting obligations under Community legislation relating to the environment, the Member State concerned should be free to decide that those spatial data sets and services shall not be subject to any charging. The mechanisms for sharing spatial data sets and services between government and other public administrations and natural or legal persons performing public administrative functions under national law should take into account the need to protect the financial viability of public authorities, in particular those that have a duty to raise revenue. In any event, any charges applied should not exceed the cost of collection, production, reproduction and dissemination together with a reasonable return on investment.\n(24)\nThe provision of network services should be carried out in full compliance with the principles relating to the protection of personal data in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (9).\n(25)\nFrameworks for the sharing of spatial data between public authorities upon whom the Directive imposes a duty to share should be neutral in respect of such public authorities within a Member State, but also in respect of such public authorities in other Member States and of the Community institutions. Since the Community institutions and bodies frequently need to integrate and assess spatial information from all the Member States, they should be able to gain access to and use spatial data and spatial data services in accordance with harmonised conditions.\n(26)\nWith a view to stimulating the development of added-value services by third parties, for the benefit of both public authorities and the public, it is necessary to facilitate access to spatial data that extend over administrative or national borders.\n(27)\nThe effective implementation of infrastructures for spatial information requires coordination by all those with an interest in the establishment of such infrastructures, whether as contributors or users. Appropriate coordination structures which extend to the various levels of government and take account of the distribution of powers and responsibilities within the Member States should therefore be established.\n(28)\nIn order to benefit from the state of the art and actual experience of information infrastructures, it is appropriate that the measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be supported by international standards and standards adopted by European standardisation bodies in accordance with the procedure laid down in Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (10).\n(29)\nSince the European Environment Agency set up by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 on the establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Information and Observation Network (11) has the task of providing the Community with objective, reliable and comparable environmental information at Community level, and aims inter alia to improve the flow of policy-relevant environmental information between Member States and the Community institutions, it should contribute actively to the implementation of this Directive.\n(30)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (12), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(31)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (13).\n(32)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adapt the description of the existing data themes referred to in Annexes I, II and III. Since such measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(33)\nThe Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing rules laying down technical arrangements for the interoperability and harmonisation of spatial data sets and services, rules governing the conditions concerning access to such sets and services, as well as rules concerning the technical specifications and obligations of network services. Since such measures are of general scope and are designed to supplement this Directive by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(34)\nPreparatory work for decisions concerning the implementation of this Directive and for the future evolution of Inspire requires continuous monitoring of the implementation of the Directive and regular reporting.\n(35)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely the establishment of Inspire, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the transnational aspects and the general need within the Community to coordinate the conditions of access to, exchange and sharing of spatial information, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\n1.   The purpose of this Directive is to lay down general rules aimed at the establishment of the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (hereinafter referred to as Inspire), for the purposes of Community environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment.\n2.   Inspire shall build upon infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the Member States.\nArticle 2\n1.   This Directive is without prejudice to Directives 2003/4/EC and 2003/98/EC.\n2.

This Directive shall cover spatial data sets which fulfil the following conditions:\n(a)\nthey relate to an area where a Member State has and/or exercises jurisdictional rights;\n(b)\nthey are in electronic format;\n(c)\nthey are held by or on behalf of any of the following:\n(i)\na public authority, having been produced or received by a public authority, or being managed or updated by that authority and falling within the scope of its public tasks;\n(ii)\na third party to whom the network has been made available in accordance with Article 12;\n(d)\nthey relate to one or more of the themes listed in Annex I, II or III.\n2.   In cases where multiple identical copies of the same spatial data set are held by or on behalf of various public authorities, this Directive shall apply only to the reference version from which the various copies are derived.\n3.   This Directive shall also cover the spatial data services relating to the data contained in the spatial data sets referred to in paragraph 1.\n4.   This Directive does not require collection of new spatial data.\n5.   In the case of spatial data sets which comply with the condition set out in paragraph 1(c), but in respect of which a third party holds intellectual property rights, the public authority may take action under this Directive only with the consent of that third party.\n6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, this Directive shall cover spatial data sets held by or on behalf of a public authority operating at the lowest level of government within a Member State only if the Member State has laws or regulations requiring their collection or dissemination.\n7.   The description of the existing data themes referred to in Annexes I, II and III may be adapted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 22(3), in order to take into account the evolving needs for spatial data in support of Community policies that affect the environment.\nCHAPTER II\nMETADATA\nArticle 5\n1.   Member States shall ensure that metadata are created for the spatial data sets and services corresponding to the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III, and that those metadata are kept up to date.\n2.   Metadata shall include information on the following:\n(a)\nthe conformity of spatial data sets with the implementing rules provided for in Article 7(1);\n(b)\nconditions applying to access to, and use of, spatial data sets and services and, where applicable, corresponding fees;\n(c)\nthe quality and validity of spatial data sets;\n(d)\nthe public authorities responsible for the establishment, management, maintenance and distribution of spatial data sets and services;\n(e)\nlimitations on public access and the reasons for such limitations, in accordance with Article 13.\n3.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that metadata are complete and of a quality sufficient to fulfil the purpose set out in point (6) of Article 3.\n4.   Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted by 15 May 2008 in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 22(2). These rules shall take account of relevant, existing international standards and user requirements, in particular with relation to validation metadata.\nArticle 6\nMember States shall create the metadata referred to in Article 5 in accordance with the following timetable:\n(a)\nnot later than two years after the date of adoption of implementing rules in accordance with Article 5(4) in the case of the spatial data sets corresponding to the themes listed in Annexes I and II;\n(b)\nnot later than five years after the date of adoption of implementing rules in accordance with Article 5(4) in the case of the spatial data sets corresponding to the themes listed in Annex III.\nCHAPTER III\nINTEROPERABILITY OF SPATIAL DATA SETS AND SERVICES\nArticle 7\n1.   Implementing rules laying down technical arrangements for the interoperability and, where practicable, harmonisation of spatial data sets and services, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 22(3). Relevant user requirements, existing initiatives and international standards for the harmonisation of spatial data sets, as well as feasibility and cost-benefit considerations shall be taken into account in the development of the implementing rules. Where organisations established under international law have adopted relevant standards to ensure interoperability or harmonisation of spatial data sets and services, these standards shall be integrated, and the existing technical means shall be referred to, if appropriate, in the implementing rules mentioned in this paragraph.\n2.   As a basis for developing the implementing rules provided for in paragraph 1, the Commission shall undertake analyses to ensure that the rules are feasible and proportionate in terms of their likely costs and benefits and shall share the results of such analyses with the committee referred to in Article 22(1). Member States shall, on request, provide the Commission with the information necessary to enable it to undertake such analyses.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that all newly collected and extensively restructured spatial data sets and the corresponding spatial data services are available in conformity with the implementing rules referred to in paragraph 1 within two years of their adoption, and that other spatial data sets and services still in use are available in conformity with the implementing rules within seven years of their adoption. Spatial data sets shall be made available in conformity with the implementing rules either through the adaptation of existing spatial data sets or through the transformation services referred to point (d) of Article 11(1).\n4.   Implementing rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover the definition and classification of spatial objects relevant to spatial data sets related to the themes listed in Annex I, II or III and the way in which those spatial data are geo-referenced.\n5.   Representatives of Member States at national, regional and local level as well as other natural or legal persons with an interest in the spatial data concerned by virtue of their role in the infrastructure for spatial information, including users, producers, added value service providers or any coordinating body shall be given the opportunity to participate in preparatory discussions on the content of the implementing rules referred to in paragraph 1, prior to consideration by the Committee referred to in Article 22(1).\nArticle 8\n1.   In the case of spatial data sets corresponding to one or more of the themes listed in Annex I or II, the implementing rules provided for in Article 7(1) shall meet the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article.\n2.   The implementing rules shall address the following aspects of spatial data:\n(a)\na common framework for the unique identification of spatial objects, to which identifiers under national systems can be mapped in order to ensure interoperability between them;\n(b)\nthe relationship between spatial objects;\n(c)\nthe key attributes and the corresponding multilingual thesauri commonly required for policies which may have an impact on the environment;\n(d)\ninformation on the temporal dimension of the data;\n(e)\nupdates of the data.\n3.   The implementing rules shall be designed to ensure consistency between items of information which refer to the same location or between items of information which refer to the same object represented at different scales.\n4.   The implementing rules shall be designed to ensure that information derived from different spatial data sets is comparable as regards the aspects referred to in Article 7(4) and in paragraph 2 of this Article.\nArticle 9\nThe implementing rules provided for in Article 7(1) shall be adopted in accordance with the following timetable:\n(a)\nno later than 15 May 2009 in the case of the spatial data sets corresponding to the themes listed in Annex I;\n(b)\nno later than 15 May 2012 in the case of the spatial data sets corresponding to the themes listed in Annex II or III.\nArticle 10\n1.   Member States shall ensure that any information, including data, codes and technical classifications, needed for compliance with the implementing rules provided for in Article 7(1) is made available to public authorities or third parties in accordance with conditions that do not restrict its use for that purpose.\n2.   In order to ensure that spatial data relating to a geographical feature, the location of which spans the frontier between two or more Member States, are coherent, Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of such common features.\nCHAPTER IV\nNETWORK SERVICES\nArticle 11\n1.   Member States shall establish and operate a network of the following services for the spatial data sets and services for which metadata have been created in accordance with this Directive:\n(a)\ndiscovery services making it possible to search for spatial data sets and services on the basis of the content of the corresponding metadata and to display the content of the metadata;\n(b)\nview services making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;\n(c)\ndownload services, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;\n(d)\ntransformation services, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability;\n(e)\nservices allowing spatial data services to be invoked.\nThose services shall take into account relevant user requirements and shall be easy to use, available to the public and accessible via the Internet or any other appropriate means of telecommunication.\n2.   For the purposes of the services referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1, as a minimum the following combination of search criteria shall be implemented:\n(a)\nkeywords;\n(b)\nclassification of spatial data and services;\n(c)\nthe quality and validity of spatial data sets;\n(d)\ndegree of conformity with the implementing rules provided for in Article 7(1);\n(e)\ngeographical location;\n(f)\nconditions applying to the access to and use of spatial data sets and services;\n(g)\nthe public authorities responsible for the establishment, management, maintenance and distribution of spatial data sets and services.\n3.   The transformation services referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 shall be combined with the other services referred to in that paragraph in such a way as to enable all those services to be operated in conformity with the implementing rules provided for in Article 7(1).\nArticle 12\nMember States shall ensure that public authorities are given the technical possibility to link their spatial data sets and services to the network referred to in Article 11(1). This service shall also be made available upon request to third parties whose spatial data sets and services comply with implementing rules laying down obligations with regard, in particular, to metadata, network services and interoperability.\nArticle 13\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 11(1), Member States may limit public access to spatial data sets and services through the services referred to in point (a) of Article 11(1) where such access would adversely affect international relations, public security or national defence.\nBy way of derogation from Article 11(1), Member States may limit public access to spatial data sets and services through the services referred to in points (b) to (e) of Article 11(1), or to the e-commerce services referred to in Article 14(3), where such access would adversely affect any of the following:\n(a)\nthe confidentiality of the proceedings of public authorities, where such confidentiality is provided for by law;\n(b)\ninternational relations, public security or national defence;\n(c)\nthe course of justice, the ability of any person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an enquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature;\n(d)\nthe confidentiality of commercial or industrial information, where such confidentiality is provided for by national or Community law to protect a legitimate economic interest, including the public interest in maintaining statistical confidentiality and tax secrecy;\n(e)\nintellectual property rights;\n(f)\nthe confidentiality of personal data and/or files relating to a natural person where that person has not consented to the disclosure of the information to the public, where such confidentiality is provided for by national or Community law;\n(g)\nthe interests or protection of any person who supplied the information requested on a voluntary basis without being under, or capable of being put under, a legal obligation to do so, unless that person has consented to the release of the information concerned;\n(h)\nthe protection of the environment to which such information relates, such as the location of rare species.\n2.   The grounds for limiting access, as provided for in paragraph 1, shall be interpreted in a restrictive way, taking into account for the particular case the public interest served by providing this access. In every particular case, the public interest served by disclosure shall be weighed against the interest served by limiting or conditioning the access. Member States may not, by virtue of points (a), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of paragraph 1, limit access to information on emissions into the environment.\n3.   Within this framework, and for the purposes of the application of point (f) of paragraph 1, Member States shall ensure that the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC are complied with.\nArticle 14\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the services referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 11(1) are available to the public free of charge.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may allow a public authority supplying a service referred to in point (b) of Article 11(1) to apply charges where such charges secure the maintenance of spatial data sets and corresponding data services, especially in cases involving very large volumes of frequently updated data.\n3.   Data made available through the view services referred to in point (b) of Article 11(1) may be in a form preventing their re-use for commercial purposes.\n4.   Where public authorities levy charges for the services referred to in points (b), (c) or (e) of Article 11(1), Member States shall ensure that e-commerce services are available. Such services may be covered by disclaimers, click-licences or, where necessary, licences.\nArticle 15\n1.   The Commission shall establish and operate an Inspire geo-portal at Community level.\n2.   Member States shall provide access to the services referred to in Article 11(1) through the Inspire geo-portal referred to in paragraph 1. Member States may also provide access to those services through their own access points.\nArticle 16\nRules for implementation designed to amend non-essential elements of this Chapter by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 22(3), and shall in particular lay down the following:\n(a)\ntechnical specifications for the services referred to in Articles 11 and 12 and minimum performance criteria for those services, taking account of existing reporting requirements and recommendations adopted within the framework of Community environmental legislation, existing e-commerce services and technological progress;\n(b)\nthe obligations referred to in Article 12.\nCHAPTER V\nDATA-SHARING\nArticle 17\n1.   Each Member State shall adopt measures for the sharing of spatial data sets and services between its public authorities referred to in point (9)(a) and (b) of Article 3. Those measures shall enable those public authorities to gain access to spatial data sets and services, and to exchange and use those sets and services, for the purposes of public tasks that may have an impact on the environment.\n2.   The measures provided for in paragraph 1 shall preclude any restrictions likely to create practical obstacles, occurring at the point of use, to the sharing of spatial data sets and services.\n3.   Member States may allow public authorities that supply spatial data sets and services to license them to, and/or require payment from, the public authorities or institutions and bodies of the Community that use these spatial data sets and services. Any such charges and licenses must be fully compatible with the general aim of facilitating the sharing of spatial data sets and services between public authorities. Where charges are made, these shall be kept to the minimum required to ensure the necessary quality and supply of spatial data sets and services together with a reasonable return on investment, while respecting the self-financing requirements of public authorities supplying spatial data sets and services, where applicable. Spatial data sets and services provided by Member States to Community institutions and bodies in order to fulfil their reporting obligations under Community legislation relating to the environment shall not be subject to any charging.\n4.   The arrangements for the sharing of spatial data sets and services provided for in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be open to public authorities referred to in point (9)(a) and (b) of Article 3 of other Member States and to the institutions and bodies of the Community, for the purposes of public tasks that may have an impact on the environment.\n5.   The arrangements for the sharing of spatial data sets and services provided for in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be open, on a reciprocal and equivalent basis, to bodies established by international agreements to which the Community and Member States are parties, for the purposes of tasks that may have an impact on the environment.\n6.   Where the arrangements for the sharing of spatial data sets and services provided for in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are made available in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5, these arrangements may be accompanied by requirements under national law conditioning their use.\n7.   By way of derogation from this Article, Member States may limit sharing when this would compromise the course of justice, public security, national defence or international relations.\n8.

Directive as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 33, 4.2.2006, p. 1).", "summary": "The EU’s infrastructure for spatial information (Inspire)\nThe EU’s infrastructure for spatial information (Inspire)\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2007/2/EC establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the European Community (Inspire)\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt lays down general rules setting up an infrastructure for spatial information* in Europe for the purposes of European Union (EU) environmental policies and for policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment.\nThe European infrastructure builds on that of spatial information that is established and operated by EU countries.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe legislation applies to spatial data that:\ncover areas where EU countries have jurisdictional rights;\nexist in electronic format;\nare held by, or on behalf of, a public authority or another body using the network;\nrelate to environmental information.\nEU countries are responsible for ensuring that metadata* are created for the various environmental spatial data* sets and services listed in the legislation. Depending on the subject, these must be established within 2 or 5 years of the rules coming into force.\nThe European Commission, assisted by a committee, adopts the technical arrangements to ensure spatial data sets and services can work together and harmonises them where this can be put into practice.\nThese implementing rules were to be adopted no later than 15 May 2009 or 15 May 2012, depending on the subject.\nEU countries must establish and operate a network with the following services:\nDiscovery: to search for spatial data sets and services.\nView: to display, navigate, zoom in and out, pan or overlay viewable spatial data sets.\nDownload: where this can be put into practice, to access directly and download copies of spatial data sets.\nTransformation: to transform spatial data sets to achieve interoperability.\nPublic authorities must be able to link their spatial data sets and services to the national network.\nEU countries may limit public access to spatial data sets and services for various reasons, such as legal confidentiality, public security, intellectual property rights or protection of the environment.\nThe Commission operates an EU Inspire geoportal. This gives access to the national networks.\nThe legislation does not require the collection of new spatial data.\nEvaluation\nIn August 2016, the Commission published its report on implementation of the INSPIRE Directive (2007/2/EC). Together with this report, it presented a detailed evaluation which was carried out in the context of its Regulatory Fitness (REFIT) programme.\nThis evaluation has demonstrated that the INSPIRE directive is still largely fit-for purpose, but that further efforts are needed at EU and at EU country level to close the significant implementation gaps and to reap the benefits of the directive. Moreover, specific issues needing attention concern the data policy provisions (Article 17 of the directive) and requirements and use of some of the technical specifications in the implementing rules (including the streamlining of reporting).\nAs a consequence, the Commission has issued a number of recommendations and actions which it will now implement in close collaboration with the EU countries in a Maintenance and Implementation Work Programme 2016-2020.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 15 May 2007. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 15 May 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Inspire Directive’ on the European Commission's website.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nInfrastructure for spatial information: covers metadata, spatial data sets and spatial data services; network services and technologies; agreements on sharing, access and use; and coordination and monitoring mechanisms, processes and procedures.\nMetadata: information describing spatial data sets and spatial data services, making it possible to discover, inventory and use them.\nSpatial data: any data with direct or indirect reference to a specific location or geographical area, such as addresses, transport networks, elevation and land use.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (Inspire) (OJ L 108, 25.4.2007, pp. 1-14)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 of 3 December 2008 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata (OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, pp. 12-30).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 have been incorporated into the basic text.
