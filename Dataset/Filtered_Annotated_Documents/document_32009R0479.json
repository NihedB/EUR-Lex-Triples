{"celex_id": "32009R0479", "reference": "10.6.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 145/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 479/2009\nof 25 May 2009\non the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community\n(Codified version)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 104(14) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nThe definitions of ‘government’, ‘deficit’ and ‘investment’ are laid down in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure by reference to the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts (ESA), replaced by the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (adopted by Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community and hereinafter referred to as ‘ESA 95’) (5). Precise definitions referring to the classification codes of ESA 95 are required. Those definitions may be subject to revision in the context of the necessary harmonisation of national statistics or for other reasons. Any revision of ESA will be decided by the Council in accordance with the rules on competence and procedure laid down in the Treaty.\n(3)\nUnder ESA 95, interest flows under swap contracts and forward rate agreements (FRAs) are to be classified in the financial account and require specific treatment for the data transmitted under the excessive deficit procedure.\n(4)\nThe definition of ‘debt’ laid down in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure needs to be amplified by a reference to the classification codes of ESA 95.\n(5)\nIn the case of financial derivatives, as defined in ESA 95, there is no nominal value identical to that for other debt instruments. Therefore, it is necessary that financial derivatives are not included with the liabilities making up government debt for the purposes of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure. For liabilities which are subject to agreements fixing the exchange rate, this rate should be taken into account in the conversion into national currency.\n(6)\nESA 95 provides a detailed definition of gross domestic product at current market prices, which is appropriate for the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product and of government debt to gross domestic product referred to in Article 104 of the Treaty.\n(7)\nConsolidated government interest expenditure is an important indicator for monitoring the budgetary situation in the Member States. Interest expenditure is intrinsically linked to government debt. Government debt to be reported to the Commission by the Member States has to be consolidated within the government sector. The levels of government debt and of interest expenditure should be made mutually consistent. The methodology of ESA 95 (point 1.58) recognises that, for certain kinds of analysis, consolidated aggregates are more significant than overall gross figures.\n(8)\nPursuant to the terms of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, the Commission is required to provide the statistical data to be used in that procedure.\n(9)\nThe role of the Commission, as statistical authority, in that context is specifically exercised by Eurostat, on behalf of the Commission. As the Commission department responsible for carrying out the tasks devolving on the Commission as regards the production of Community statistics, Eurostat is required to execute its tasks in accordance with the principles of impartiality, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness, statistical confidentiality and transparency, as laid down in Commission Decision 97/281/EC of 21 April 1997 on the role of Eurostat as regards the production of Community statistics (6). The implementation by the national and Community statistical authorities of the Recommendation of the Commission of 25 May 2005 on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community authorities should enhance the principle of professional independence, adequacy of resources and quality of statistical data.\n(10)\nEurostat is responsible, on behalf of the Commission, for assessing the quality of the data and for providing the data to be used within the context of the excessive deficit procedure, in accordance with Commission Decision 97/281/EC.\n(11)\nA permanent dialogue should be established between the Commission and the Member States’ statistical authorities in order to ensure the quality both of the data reported by Member States and of the underlying government sector accounts compiled in accordance with ESA 95.\n(12)\nDetailed rules are required to organise prompt and regular reporting by the Member States to the Commission (Eurostat) of their planned and actual deficits and of the levels of their debt.\n(13)\nPursuant to Article 104c(2) and (3) of the Treaty, the Commission is to monitor the development of the budgetary situation and of the stock of government debt in the Member States and to examine compliance with budgetary discipline on the basis of criteria relating to government deficit and government debt. If a Member State does not fulfil the requirements under one or both criteria, it is necessary for the Commission to take into account all relevant factors. The Commission has to examine whether there is a risk of an excessive deficit in a Member State,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nDEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\n1.   For the purposes of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure and of this Regulation, the terms given in paragraphs 2 to 6 are defined according to the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (hereinafter referred to as ESA 95), adopted by Regulation (EC) No 2223/96. The codes in brackets refer to ESA 95.\n2.   ‘Government’ means the sector of ‘general government’ (S.13), that is ‘central government’ (S.1311), ‘state government’ (S.1312), ‘local government’ (S.1313) and ‘social security funds’ (S.1314), to the exclusion of commercial operations, as defined in ESA 95.\nThe exclusion of commercial operations means that the sector of ‘general government’ (S.13) comprises only institutional units producing non-market services as their main activity.\n3.   ‘Government deficit (surplus)’ means the net borrowing (net lending) (EDP B.9) of the sector of ‘general government’ (S.13), as defined in ESA 95. The interest comprised in the government deficit is the interest (EDP D.41), as defined in ESA 95.\n4.   ‘Government investment’ means the gross fixed capital formation (P.51) of the sector of ‘general government’ (S.13), as defined in ESA 95.\n5.   ‘Government debt’ means the total gross debt at nominal value outstanding at the end of the year of the sector of ‘general government’ (S.13), with the exception of those liabilities the corresponding financial assets of which are held by the sector of ‘general government’ (S.13).\nGovernment debt is constituted by the liabilities of general government in the following categories: currency and deposits (AF.2); securities other than shares, excluding financial derivatives (AF.33) and loans (AF.4), as defined in ESA 95.\nThe nominal value of a liability outstanding at the end of the year is the face value.\nThe nominal value of an index-linked liability corresponds to its face value adjusted by the index-related change in the value of the principal accrued to the end of the year.\nLiabilities denominated in a foreign currency, or exchanged from one foreign currency through contractual agreements to one or more other foreign currencies shall be converted into the other foreign currencies at the rate agreed on in those contracts and shall be converted into the national currency on the basis of the representative market exchange rate prevailing on the last working day of each year.\nLiabilities denominated in the national currency and exchanged through contractual agreements to a foreign currency shall be converted into the foreign currency at the rate agreed on in those contracts and shall be converted into the national currency on the basis of the representative market exchange rate prevailing on the last working day of each year.\nLiabilities denominated in a foreign currency and exchanged through contractual agreements to the national currency shall be converted into the national currency at the rate agreed on in those contracts.\n6.   ‘Gross domestic product’ means gross domestic product at current market prices (GDP mp) (B.1*g), as defined in ESA 95.\nArticle 2\n1.   ‘Planned government deficit and government debt level figures’ means the figures established for the current year by the Member States.

The Commission (Eurostat) shall regularly assess the quality both of actual data reported by Member States and of the underlying government sector accounts compiled according to ESA 95 (hereinafter referred to as government accounts). Quality of actual data means compliance with accounting rules, completeness, reliability, timeliness, and consistency of the statistical data. The assessment will focus on areas specified in the inventories of Member States such as the delimitation of the government sector, the classification of government transactions and liabilities, and the time of recording.\n2.   Member States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat), as promptly as possible, with the relevant statistical information requested for the needs of the data quality assessment, without prejudice to the provisions relating to statistical confidentiality of Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (7).\n‘Statistical information’ referred to in the first subparagraph shall be limited to the information strictly necessary to check the compliance to ESA rules.

Member States shall take all necessary measures to facilitate the methodological visits. Those visits should be confined to the national authorities involved in the excessive deficit procedure reporting. Member States shall, however, ensure that their services which are directly or indirectly involved in the production of government accounts and debt, and where necessary their national authorities which have a functional responsibility for the control of the public accounts, provide the Commission officials or other experts referred to in paragraph 1 with the assistance necessary to carry out their duties, including making documents available to justify the reported actual deficit and debt data and the underlying government accounts. Confidential records of the national statistical system shall only be provided to the Commission (Eurostat).\nWithout prejudice to the general obligation of the Member States to take all measures required to facilitate the methodological visits, the interlocutors of the Commission (Eurostat) for the methodological visits referred to in the first subparagraph are, in each Member State, the services responsible for the excessive deficit procedure reporting.\n3.   The Commission (Eurostat) shall ensure that officials and experts participating in these visits meet every guarantee as regards technical competence, professional independence and observance of confidentiality.\nArticle 13\nThe Commission (Eurostat) shall report to the Economic and Financial Committee on the findings of dialogue and methodological visits, including any comments on these findings made by the Member State concerned. Those reports, along with any comments made by the Member State concerned, after having been transmitted to the Economic and Financial Committee, shall be made public, without prejudice to the provisions concerning statistical confidentiality in Regulation (EC) No 322/97.\nCHAPTER IV\nPROVISION OF DATA BY THE COMMISSION\n(EUROSTAT)\nArticle 14\n1.   The Commission (Eurostat) shall provide the actual government deficit and debt data for the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, within three weeks after the reporting deadlines referred to in Article 3(1) or after revisions as referred to in Article 6(1). That provision of data shall be effected through publication.\n2.   The Commission (Eurostat) shall not delay the provision of the actual government deficit and debt data of Member States where a Member State has not reported its own data.\nArticle 15\n1.
