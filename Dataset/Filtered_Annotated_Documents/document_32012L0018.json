{"celex_id": "32012L0018", "reference": "24.7.2012\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 197/1\nDIRECTIVE 2012/18/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 4 July 2012\non the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, amending and subsequently repealing Council Directive 96/82/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (3) lays down rules for the prevention of major accidents which might result from certain industrial activities and the limitation of their consequences for human health and the environment.\n(2)\nMajor accidents often have serious consequences, as evidenced by accidents like Seveso, Bhopal, Schweizerhalle, Enschede, Toulouse and Buncefield. Moreover the impact can extend beyond national borders. This underlines the need to ensure that appropriate precautionary action is taken to ensure a high level of protection throughout the Union for citizens, communities and the environment. There is therefore a need to ensure that the existing high level of protection remains at least the same or increases.\n(3)\nDirective 96/82/EC has been instrumental in reducing the likelihood and consequences of such accidents thereby leading to a better level of protection throughout the Union. A review of that Directive has confirmed that the rate of major accidents has remained stable. While overall the existing provisions are fit for purpose, some changes are required in order to further strengthen the level of protection, in particular with regard to the prevention of major accidents. At the same time the system established by Directive 96/82/EC should be adapted to changes to the Union system of classification of substances and mixtures to which that Directive refers. In addition, a number of other provisions should be clarified and updated.\n(4)\nIt is therefore appropriate to replace Directive 96/82/EC in order to ensure that the existing level of protection is maintained and further improved, by making the provisions more effective and efficient, and where possible by reducing unnecessary administrative burdens by streamlining or simplification, provided that safety and environmental and human health protection are not compromised. At the same time, the new provisions should be clear, coherent and easy to understand to help improve implementation and enforceability, while the level of protection of human health and the environment remains at least the same or increases. The Commission should cooperate with the Member States on the practical implementation of this Directive. That cooperation should, inter alia, address the issue of self-classification of substances and mixtures. As appropriate, stakeholders such as representatives of industry, workers and non-governmental organisations promoting the protection of human health or the environment should be involved in the implementation of this Directive.\n(5)\nThe Convention of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents, which was approved on behalf of the Union by Council Decision 98/685/EC of 23 March 1998 concerning the conclusion of the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents (4), provides for measures regarding the prevention of, preparedness for, and response to industrial accidents capable of causing transboundary effects as well as for international cooperation in this field. Directive 96/82/EC implements the Convention within Union law.\n(6)\nMajor accidents can have consequences beyond frontiers, and the ecological and economic costs of an accident are borne not only by the establishment affected, but also by the Member States concerned. It is therefore necessary to establish and apply safety and risk-reduction measures to prevent possible accidents, to reduce the risk of accidents occurring and to minimise the effects if they do occur, thereby making it possible to ensure a high level of protection throughout the Union.\n(7)\nThe provisions of this Directive should apply without prejudice to the provisions of Union law relating to health and safety at work and the working environment, and, in particular, without prejudice to Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5).\n(8)\nCertain industrial activities should be excluded from the scope of this Directive provided they are subject to other legislation at Union or national level providing for an equivalent level of safety. The Commission should continue to examine whether there are significant gaps in the existing regulatory framework, in particular as regards new and emerging risks from other activities as well as from specific dangerous substances and, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal to address those gaps.\n(9)\nAnnex I to Directive 96/82/EC lists the dangerous substances falling within its scope, inter alia, by reference to certain provisions of Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (6) as well as Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (7). Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC have been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (8), which implements within the Union the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals that has been adopted at international level, within the structure of the United Nations (UN). That Regulation introduces new hazard classes and categories only partially corresponding to those used under those repealed Directives. Certain substances or mixtures would, however, not be classified under that system due to an absence of criteria within that framework. Annex I to Directive 96/82/EC therefore needs to be amended to align it to that Regulation while maintaining the existing level, or further increasing the level, of protection provided for in that Directive.\n(10)\nFor the purpose of classifying upgraded biogas, any developments on standards under the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) should be taken into account.\n(11)\nUnwanted effects from the alignment to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and subsequent adaptations to that Regulation having an impact on the classification of substances and mixtures may occur. On the basis of criteria included in this Directive, the Commission should assess whether, notwithstanding their hazard classification, there are dangerous substances which do not present a major-accident hazard and, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to exclude the dangerous substance concerned from the scope of this Directive. The assessment should start swiftly, in particular after the change of classification of a substance or mixture, in order to avoid unnecessary burdens for operators and competent authorities in the Member States. Exclusions from the scope of this Directive should not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures.\n(12)\nOperators should have a general obligation to take all necessary measures to prevent major accidents, to mitigate their consequences and to take recovery measures. Where dangerous substances are present in establishments above certain quantities the operator should provide the competent authority with sufficient information to enable it to identify the establishment, the dangerous substances present and the potential dangers. The operator should also draw up and, where required by national law, send to the competent authority a major-accident prevention policy (MAPP) setting out the operator’s overall approach and measures, including appropriate safety management systems, for controlling major-accident hazards. When the operators identify and evaluate the major-accident hazards, consideration should also be given to the dangerous substances which may be generated during a severe accident within the establishment.\n(13)\nDirective 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (9) is normally relevant for environmental damage caused by a major accident.\n(14)\nIn order to reduce the risk of domino effects, where establishments are sited in such a way or so close together as to increase the likelihood of major accidents, or aggravate their consequences, operators should cooperate in the exchange of appropriate information and in informing the public, including neighbouring establishments that could be affected.\n(15)\nIn order to demonstrate that all that is necessary has been done to prevent major accidents, and to prepare emergency plans and response measures, the operator should, in the case of establishments where dangerous substances are present in significant quantities, provide the competent authority with information in the form of a safety report. That safety report should contain details of the establishment, the dangerous substances present, the installation or storage facilities, possible major-accident scenarios and risk analysis, prevention and intervention measures and the management systems available, in order to prevent and reduce the risk of major accidents and to enable the necessary steps to be taken to limit the consequences thereof. The risk of a major accident could be increased by the probability of natural disasters associated with the location of the establishment. This should be considered during the preparation of major-accident scenarios.\n(16)\nTo prepare for emergencies, in the case of establishments where dangerous substances are present in significant quantities, it is necessary to establish internal and external emergency plans and to establish procedures to ensure that those plans are tested and revised as necessary and implemented in the event of a major accident or the likelihood thereof. The staff of an establishment should be consulted on the internal emergency plan and the public concerned should have the opportunity to give its opinion on the external emergency plan. Sub-contracting may have an impact on the safety of an establishment. Member States should require operators to take this into account when drafting a MAPP, a safety report or an internal emergency plan.\n(17)\nWhen considering the choice of appropriate operating methods, including those for monitoring and control, operators should take into account available information on best practices.\n(18)\nIn order to provide greater protection for residential areas, areas of substantial public use and the environment, including areas of particular natural interest or sensitivity, it is necessary for land-use or other relevant policies applied in the Member States to ensure appropriate distances between such areas and establishments presenting such hazards and, where existing establishments are concerned, to implement, if necessary, additional technical measures so that the risk to persons or the environment is maintained at an acceptable level. Sufficient information about the risks and technical advice on these risks should be taken into account when decisions are taken. Where possible, to reduce administrative burdens, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, procedures and measures should be integrated with those under other relevant Union legislation.\n(19)\nIn order to promote access to environmental information under the Convention of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters (the Aarhus Convention), which was approved on behalf of the Union by Council Decision 2005/370/EC of 17 February 2005 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters (10), the level and quality of information to the public should be improved. In particular, persons likely to be affected by a major accident should be given sufficient information on the correct action to be taken in that event. Member States should make information available on where to find information on the rights of persons affected by a major accident. Information disseminated to the public should be worded clearly and intelligibly. In addition to providing information in an active way, without the public having to submit a request, and without precluding other forms of dissemination, it should also be made available permanently and kept up to date electronically. At the same time there should be appropriate confidentiality safeguards, to address security-related concerns, among others.\n(20)\nThe way information is managed should be in line with the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) initiative introduced by the Commission Communication of 1 February 2008 entitled ‘Towards a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS)’. It should also be in line with Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (11) and its implementing rules, aimed at enabling the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations and better facilitating public access to spatial information across the Union. Information should be held on a publicly available database at Union level, which will also facilitate monitoring and reporting on implementation.\n(21)\nIn line with the Aarhus Convention, effective public participation in decision-making is necessary to enable the public concerned to express, and the decision-maker to take account of, opinions and concerns that may be relevant to those decisions, thereby increasing the accountability and transparency of the decision-making process and contributing to public awareness of environmental issues and support for the decisions taken.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure that adequate response measures are taken if a major accident occurs, the operator should immediately inform the competent authority and communicate the information necessary to enable it to assess the effects of that accident on human health and on the environment.\n(23)\nLocal authorities have an interest in the prevention of major accidents and mitigation of their consequences and can have an important role to play. This should be taken into account by the Member States in the implementation of this Directive.\n(24)\nIn order to facilitate the exchange of information and to prevent future accidents of a similar nature, Member States should forward information to the Commission regarding major accidents occurring on their territory, so that the Commission can analyse the hazards involved, and operate a system for the distribution of information concerning, in particular, major accidents and lessons learned from them. That exchange of information should also cover ‘near misses’ which Member States regard as being of particular technical interest for preventing major accidents and limiting their consequences. Member States and the Commission should strive to ensure the completeness of the information held on information systems established to facilitate the exchange of information on major accidents.\n(25)\nMember States should determine the competent authorities responsible for ensuring that operators fulfil their obligations. The competent authorities and the Commission should cooperate in activities in support of implementation such as the development of appropriate guidance and exchanges of best practice. To avoid unnecessary administrative burden, information obligations should be integrated, where appropriate, with those under other relevant Union legislation.\n(26)\nMember States should ensure that competent authorities take the necessary measures in the event of non-compliance with this Directive. In order to ensure effective implementation and enforcement, there should be a system of inspections, including a programme of routine inspections at regular intervals and non-routine inspections. Where possible, inspections should be coordinated with those under other Union legislation, including Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (12), where appropriate. Member States should ensure that sufficient staff is available with the skills and qualifications needed to carry out inspections effectively. Competent authorities should provide appropriate support using tools and mechanisms for exchanging experience and consolidating knowledge, including at Union level.\n(27)\nIn order to take into account technical developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annexes II to VI to adapt them to technical progress. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(28)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (13).\n(29)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(30)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can, therefore, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(31)\nIn accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September 2011 on explanatory documents (14), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.\n(32)\nDirective 96/82/EC should therefore be amended and subsequently repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down rules for the prevention of major accidents which involve dangerous substances, and the limitation of their consequences for human health and the environment, with a view to ensuring a high level of protection throughout the Union in a consistent and effective manner.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

The Commission shall assess, where appropriate or in any event on the basis of a notification by a Member State in accordance with paragraph 2, whether it is impossible in practice for a particular dangerous substance covered by Part 1 or listed in Part 2 of Annex I, to cause a release of matter or energy that could create a major accident under both normal and abnormal conditions which can reasonably be foreseen. That assessment shall take into account the information referred to in paragraph 3, and shall be based on one or more of the following characteristics:\n(a)\nthe physical form of the dangerous substance under normal processing or handling conditions or in an unplanned loss of containment;\n(b)\nthe inherent properties of the dangerous substance, in particular those related to dispersive behaviour in a major-accident scenario, such as molecular mass and saturated vapour pressure;\n(c)\nthe maximum concentration of the substances in the case of mixtures.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, the containment and generic packing of the dangerous substance should, where appropriate, also be taken into account, including in particular where covered under specific Union legislation.\n2.   Where a Member State considers that a dangerous substance does not present a major-accident hazard in accordance with paragraph 1, it shall notify the Commission together with supporting justification, including the information referred to in paragraph 3.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, information necessary for assessing the health, physical and environmental hazard properties of the dangerous substance concerned shall include:\n(a)\na comprehensive list of properties necessary to assess the dangerous substance’s potential for causing physical, health or environmental harm;\n(b)\nphysical and chemical properties (for instance molecular mass, saturated vapour pressure, inherent toxicity, boiling point, reactivity, viscosity, solubility and other relevant properties);\n(c)\nhealth and physical hazard properties (for instance reactivity, flammability, toxicity together with additional factors such as mode of attack on the body, injury to fatality ratio, and long-term effects, and other properties as relevant);\n(d)\nenvironmental hazard properties (for instance ecotoxicity, persistence, bio-accumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport, and other properties as relevant);\n(e)\nwhere available, the Union classification of the substance or mixture;\n(f)\ninformation about substance-specific operating conditions (for instance temperature, pressure and other conditions as relevant) under which the dangerous substance is stored, used and/or may be present in the event of foreseeable abnormal operations or an accident such as fire.\n4.   Following the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council to exclude the dangerous substance concerned from the scope of this Directive.\nArticle 5\nGeneral obligations of the operator\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the operator is obliged to take all necessary measures to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences for human health and the environment.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the operator is required to prove to the competent authority referred to in Article 6, at any time, in particular for the purposes of inspections and controls referred to in Article 20, that the operator has taken all necessary measures as specified in this Directive.\nArticle 6\nCompetent authority\n1.   Without prejudice to the operator’s responsibilities, Member States shall set up or appoint the competent authority or authorities responsible for carrying out the duties laid down in this Directive (‘the competent authority’) and, if necessary, bodies to assist the competent authority at technical level. Member States which set up or appoint more than one competent authority shall ensure that the procedures for carrying out their duties are fully coordinated.\n2.   The competent authorities and the Commission shall cooperate in activities in support of implementation of this Directive, involving stakeholders as appropriate.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that competent authorities accept equivalent information submitted by operators in accordance with other relevant Union legislation, which fulfils any of the requirements of this Directive, for the purposes of this Directive. In such cases the competent authorities shall ensure that the requirements of this Directive are complied with.\nArticle 7\nNotification\n1.   Member States shall require the operator to send a notification to the competent authority containing the following information:\n(a)\nthe name and/or trade name of the operator and the full address of the establishment concerned;\n(b)\nthe registered place of business of the operator, with the full address;\n(c)\nthe name and position of the person in charge of the establishment, if different from point (a);\n(d)\ninformation sufficient to identify the dangerous substances and category of substances involved or likely to be present;\n(e)\nthe quantity and physical form of the dangerous substance or substances concerned;\n(f)\nthe activity or proposed activity of the installation or storage facility;\n(g)\nthe immediate environment of the establishment, and factors likely to cause a major accident or to aggravate the consequences thereof including, where available, details of neighbouring establishments, of sites that fall outside the scope of this Directive, areas and developments that could be the source of or increase the risk or consequences of a major accident and of domino effects.\n2.   The notification or its update shall be sent to the competent authority within the following time-limits:\n(a)\nfor new establishments, a reasonable period of time prior to the start of construction or operation, or prior to the modifications leading to a change in the inventory of dangerous substances;\n(b)\nfor all other cases, one year from the date from which this Directive applies to the establishment concerned.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the operator has already sent a notification to the competent authority under the requirements of national legislation before 1 June 2015, and the information contained therein complies with paragraph 1 and has remained unchanged.\n4.   The operator shall inform the competent authority in advance of the following events:\n(a)\nany significant increase or decrease in the quantity or significant change in the nature or physical form of the dangerous substance present, as indicated in the notification provided by the operator pursuant to paragraph 1, or a significant change in the processes employing it;\n(b)\nmodification of an establishment or an installation which could have significant consequences in terms of major-accident hazards;\n(c)\nthe permanent closure of the establishment or its de-commissioning; or\n(d)\nchanges in the information referred to in points (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1.\nArticle 8\nMajor-accident prevention policy\n1.   Member States shall require the operator to draw up a document in writing setting out the major-accident prevention policy (MAPP) and to ensure that it is properly implemented. The MAPP shall be designed to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment. It shall be proportionate to the major-accident hazards. It shall include the operator’s overall aims and principles of action, the role and responsibility of management, as well as the commitment towards continuously improving the control of major-accident hazards, and ensuring a high level of protection.\n2.   The MAPP shall be drawn up and, where required by national law, sent to the competent authority within the following time-limits:\n(a)\nfor new establishments, a reasonable period of time prior to the start of construction or operation, or prior to the modifications leading to a change in the inventory of dangerous substances;\n(b)\nfor all other cases, one year from the date from which this Directive applies to the establishment concerned.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the operator has already established the MAPP and, where required by national law, sent it to the competent authority before 1 June 2015, and the information contained therein complies with paragraph 1 and has remained unchanged.\n4.   Without prejudice to Article 11, the operator shall periodically review and where necessary update the MAPP, at least every five years. Where required by national law the updated MAPP shall be sent to the competent authority without delay.\n5.   The MAPP shall be implemented by appropriate means, structures and by a safety management system, in accordance with Annex III, proportionate to the major-accident hazards, and the complexity of the organisation or the activities of the establishment. For lower-tier establishments, the obligation to implement the MAPP may be fulfilled by other appropriate means, structures and management systems, proportionate to major-accident hazards, taking into account the principles set out in Annex III.\nArticle 9\nDomino effects\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the competent authority, using the information received from the operators in accordance with Articles 7 and 10, or following a request for additional information from the competent authority, or through inspections pursuant to Article 20, identifies all lower-tier and upper-tier establishments or groups of establishments where the risk or consequences of a major accident may be increased because of the geographical position and the proximity of such establishments, and their inventories of dangerous substances.\n2.   Where the competent authority has additional information to that provided by the operator pursuant to point (g) of Article 7(1), it shall make this information available to that operator, if it is necessary for the application of this Article.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that operators of the establishments identified in accordance with paragraph 1:\n(a)\nexchange suitable information to enable those establishments to take account of the nature and extent of the overall hazard of a major accident in their MAPP, safety management systems, safety reports and internal emergency plans, as appropriate;\n(b)\ncooperate in informing the public and neighbouring sites that fall outside the scope of this Directive, and in supplying information to the authority responsible for the preparation of external emergency plans.\nArticle 10\nSafety report\n1.   Member States shall require the operator of an upper-tier establishment to produce a safety report for the purposes of:\n(a)\ndemonstrating that a MAPP and a safety management system for implementing it have been put into effect in accordance with the information set out in Annex III;\n(b)\ndemonstrating that major-accident hazards and possible major-accident scenarios have been identified and that the necessary measures have been taken to prevent such accidents and to limit their consequences for human health and the environment;\n(c)\ndemonstrating that adequate safety and reliability have been taken into account in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of any installation, storage facility, equipment and infrastructure connected with its operation which are linked to major-accident hazards inside the establishment;\n(d)\ndemonstrating that internal emergency plans have been drawn up and supplying information to enable the external emergency plan to be drawn up;\n(e)\nproviding sufficient information to the competent authority to enable decisions to be made regarding the siting of new activities or developments around existing establishments.\n2.   The safety report shall contain at least the data and information listed in Annex II. It shall name the relevant organisations involved in the drawing up of the report.\n3.   The safety report shall be sent to the competent authority within the following time-limits:\n(a)\nfor new establishments, a reasonable period of time prior to the start of construction or operation, or prior to the modifications leading to a change in the inventory of dangerous substances;\n(b)\nfor existing upper-tier establishments, 1 June 2016;\n(c)\nfor other establishments, two years from the date from which this Directive applies to the establishment concerned.\n4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the operator has already sent the safety report to the competent authority under the requirements of national law before 1 June 2015, and the information contained therein complies with paragraphs 1 and 2 and has remained unchanged. In order to comply with paragraphs 1 and 2, the operator shall submit any changed parts of the safety report in the format agreed by the competent authority, subject to the time-limits referred to in paragraph 3.\n5.   Without prejudice to Article 11, the operator shall periodically review and where necessary update the safety report at least every five years.\nThe operator shall also review and where necessary update the safety report following a major accident at its establishment, and at any other time at the initiative of the operator or at the request of the competent authority, where justified by new facts or by new technological knowledge about safety matters, including knowledge arising from analysis of accidents or, as far as possible, ‘near misses’, and by developments in knowledge concerning the assessment of hazards.\nThe updated safety report or updated parts thereof shall be sent to the competent authority without delay.\n6.   Before the operator commences construction or operation, or in the cases referred to in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 3 and in paragraph 5 of this Article, the competent authority shall within a reasonable period of receipt of the report communicate the conclusions of its examination of the safety report to the operator and, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 19, prohibit the bringing into use, or the continued use, of the establishment concerned.\nArticle 11\nModification of an installation, an establishment or a storage facility\nIn the event of the modification of an installation, establishment, storage facility, or process or of the nature or physical form or quantity of dangerous substances which could have significant consequences for major-accident hazards, or could result in a lower-tier establishment becoming an upper-tier establishment or vice versa, Member States shall ensure that the operator reviews, and where necessary updates the notification, the MAPP, the safety management system and the safety report and informs the competent authority of the details of those updates in advance of that modification.\nArticle 12\nEmergency plans\n1.

1272/2008.\n2.\nMixtures shall be treated in the same way as pure substances provided they remain within concentration limits set according to their properties under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, or its latest adaptation to technical progress, unless a percentage composition or other description is specifically given.\n3.\nThe qualifying quantities set out above relate to each establishment.\nThe quantities to be considered for the application of the relevant Articles are the maximum quantities which are present or are likely to be present at any one time. Dangerous substances present at an establishment only in quantities equal to or less than 2 % of the relevant qualifying quantity shall be ignored for the purposes of calculating the total quantity present if their location within an establishment is such that it cannot act as an initiator of a major accident elsewhere at that establishment.\n4.\nThe following rules governing the addition of dangerous substances, or categories of dangerous substances, shall apply where appropriate:\nIn the case of an establishment where no individual dangerous substance is present in a quantity above or equal to the relevant qualifying quantities, the following rule shall be applied to determine whether the establishment is covered by the relevant requirements of this Directive.\nThis Directive shall apply to upper-tier establishments if the sum:\nq1/QU1 + q2/QU2 + q3/QU3 + q4/QU4 + q5/QU5 + … is greater than or equal to 1,\nwhere qx = the quantity of dangerous substance x (or category of dangerous substances) falling within Part 1 or Part 2 of this Annex,\nand QUX = the relevant qualifying quantity for dangerous substance or category x from Column 3 of Part 1 or from Column 3 of Part 2 of this Annex.\nThis Directive shall apply to lower-tier establishments if the sum:\nq1/QL1 + q2/QL2 + q3/QL3 + q4/QL4 + q5/QL5 + … is greater than or equal to 1,\nwhere qx = the quantity of dangerous substance x (or category of dangerous substances) falling within Part 1 or Part 2 of this Annex,\nand QLX = the relevant qualifying quantity for dangerous substance or category x from Column 2 of Part 1 or from Column 2 of Part 2 of this Annex.\nThis rule shall be used to assess the health hazards, physical hazards and environmental hazards. It must therefore be applied three times:\n(a)\nfor the addition of dangerous substances listed in Part 2 that fall within acute toxicity category 1, 2 or 3 (inhalation route) or STOT SE category 1, together with dangerous substances falling within section H, entries H1 to H3 of Part 1;\n(b)\nfor the addition of dangerous substances listed in Part 2 that are explosives, flammable gases, flammable aerosols, oxidising gases, flammable liquids, self-reactive substances and mixtures, organic peroxides, pyrophoric liquids and solids, oxidising liquids and solids, together with dangerous substances falling within section P, entries P1 to P8 of Part 1;\n(c)\nfor the addition of dangerous substances listed in Part 2 that fall within hazardous to the aquatic environment acute category 1, chronic category 1 or chronic category 2, together with dangerous substances falling within section E, entries E1 and E2 of Part 1.\nThe relevant provisions of this Directive apply where any of the sums obtained by (a), (b) or (c) is greater than or equal to 1.\n5.\nIn the case of dangerous substances which are not covered by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, including waste, but which nevertheless are present, or are likely to be present, in an establishment and which possess or are likely to possess, under the conditions found at the establishment, equivalent properties in terms of major-accident potential, these shall be provisionally assigned to the most analogous category or named dangerous substance falling within the scope of this Directive.\n6.\nIn the case of dangerous substances with properties giving rise to more than one classification, for the purposes of this Directive the lowest qualifying quantities shall apply. However, for the application of the rule in Note 4, the lowest qualifying quantity for each group of categories in Notes 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) corresponding to the classification concerned shall be used.\n7.\nDangerous substances that fall within Acute Toxic Category 3 via the oral route (H 301) shall fall under entry H2 ACUTE TOXIC in those cases where neither acute inhalation toxicity classification nor acute dermal toxicity classification can be derived, for example due to lack of conclusive inhalation and dermal toxicity data.\n8.\nThe hazard class Explosives includes explosive articles (see Section 2.1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008). If the quantity of the explosive substance or mixture contained in the article is known, that quantity shall be considered for the purposes of this Directive. If the quantity of the explosive substance or mixture contained in the article is not known, then, for the purposes of this Directive, the whole article shall be treated as explosive.\n9.\nTesting for explosive properties of substances and mixtures is only necessary if the screening procedure according to Appendix 6, Part 3 of the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and Criteria (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria) (2) identifies the substance or mixture as potentially having explosive properties.\n10.\nIf Explosives of Division 1.4 are unpacked or repacked, they shall be assigned to the entry P1a, unless the hazard is shown to still correspond to Division 1.4, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.\n11.1.\nFlammable aerosols are classified in accordance with the Council Directive 75/324/EEC of 20 May 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to aerosol dispensers (3) (Aerosol Dispensers Directive). ‘Extremely flammable’ and ‘Flammable’ aerosols of Directive 75/324/EEC correspond to Flammable Aerosols Category 1 or 2 respectively of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.\n11.2.\nIn order to use this entry, it must be documented that the aerosol dispenser does not contain Flammable Gas Category 1 or 2 nor Flammable Liquid Category 1.\n12.\nAccording to paragraph 2.6.4.5 in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, liquids with a flash point of more than 35 °C need not be classified in Category 3 if negative results have been obtained in the sustained combustibility test L.2, Part III, section 32 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. This is however not valid under elevated conditions such as high temperature or pressure, and therefore such liquids are included in this entry.\n13.\nAmmonium nitrate (5 000 / 10 000): fertilisers capable of self-sustaining decomposition\nThis applies to ammonium nitrate-based compound/composite fertilisers (compound/composite fertilisers contain ammonium nitrate with phosphate and/or potash) which are capable of self-sustaining decomposition according to the UN Trough Test (see UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 38.2), and in which the nitrogen content as a result of ammonium nitrate is\n—\nbetween 15,75 % (4) and 24,5 % (5) by weight, and either with not more than 0,4 % total combustible/organic materials or which fulfil the requirements of Annex III-2 to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 relating to fertilisers (6),\n—\n15,75 % by weight or less and unrestricted combustible materials.\n14.\nAmmonium nitrate (1 250 / 5 000): fertiliser grade\nThis applies to straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers and to ammonium nitrate-based compound/composite fertilisers which fulfil the requirements of Annex III-2 to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 and in which the nitrogen content as a result of ammonium nitrate is\n—\nmore than 24,5 % by weight, except for mixtures of straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers with dolomite, limestone and/or calcium carbonate with a purity of at least 90 %,\n—\nmore than 15,75 % by weight for mixtures of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate,\n—\nmore than 28 % (7) by weight for mixtures of straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers with dolomite, limestone and/or calcium carbonate with a purity of at least 90 %.\n15.\nAmmonium nitrate (350 / 2 500): technical grade\nThis applies to ammonium nitrate and mixtures of ammonium nitrate in which the nitrogen content as a result of the ammonium nitrate is\n—\nbetween 24,5 % and 28 % by weight, and which contain not more than 0,4 % combustible substances,\n—\nmore than 28 % by weight, and which contain not more than 0,2 % combustible substances.\nIt also applies to aqueous ammonium nitrate solutions in which the concentration of ammonium nitrate is more than 80 % by weight.\n16.\nAmmonium nitrate (10 / 50): ‘off-specs’ material and fertilisers not fulfilling the detonation test\nThis applies to\n—\nmaterial rejected during the manufacturing process and to ammonium nitrate and mixtures of ammonium nitrate, straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers and ammonium nitrate-based compound/composite fertilisers referred to in Notes 14 and 15, that are being or have been returned from the final user to a manufacturer, temporary storage or reprocessing plant for reworking, recycling or treatment for safe use, because they no longer comply with the specifications of Notes 14 and 15,\n—\nfertilisers referred to in first indent of Note 13, and Note 14 to this Annex which do not fulfil the requirements of Annex III-2 to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003.\n17.   Potassium nitrate (5 000 / 10 000)\nThis applies to those composite potassium-nitrate based fertilisers (in prilled/granular form) which have the same hazardous properties as pure potassium nitrate.\n18.   Potassium nitrate (1 250 / 5 000)\nThis applies to those composite potassium-nitrate based fertilisers (in crystalline form) which have the same hazardous properties as pure potassium nitrate.\n19.   Upgraded biogas\nFor the purpose of the implementation of this Directive, upgraded biogas may be classified under entry 18 of Part 2 of Annex I where it has been processed in accordance with applicable standards for purified and upgraded biogas ensuring a quality equivalent to that of natural gas, including the content of Methane, and which has a maximum of 1 % Oxygen.\n20.   Polychlorodibenzofurans and polychlorodibenzodioxins\nThe quantities of polychlorodibenzofurans and polychlorodibenzodioxins are calculated using the following factors:\nWHO 2005 TEF\n2,3,7,8-TCDD\n1\n2,3,7,8-TCDF\n0,1\n1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD\n1\n2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF\n0,3\n1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF\n0,03\n1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD\n0,1\n1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD\n0,1\n1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF\n0,1\n1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD\n0,1\n1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF\n0,1\n1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF\n0,1\n1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD\n0,01\n2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF\n0,1\nOCDD\n0,0003\n1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF\n0,01\n1,2,3,4,7,8,9-HpCDF\n0,01\nOCDF\n0,0003\n(T = tetra, P = penta, Hx = hexa, Hp = hepta, O = octa)\nReference — Van den Berg et al: The 2005 World Health Organisation Re-evaluation of Human and Mammalian Toxic Equivalency Factors for Dioxins and Dioxin-like Compounds\n21.\nIn cases where this dangerous substance falls within category P5a Flammable liquids or P5b Flammable liquids, then for the purposes of this Directive the lowest qualifying quantities shall apply.\n(1)  The CAS number is shown only for indication.\n(*1)  Provided that the mixture in the absence of sodium hypochlorite would not be classified as Aquatic Acute Category 1 [H400].\n(2)  More guidance on waiving of the test can be found in the A.14 method description, see Commission Regulation (EC) No 440/2008 of 30 May 2008 laying down test methods pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) (OJ L 142, 31.5.2008, p. 1).\n(3)  OJ L 147, 9.6.1975, p. 40.\n(4)  15,75 % nitrogen content by weight as a result of ammonium nitrate corresponds to 45 % ammonium nitrate.\n(5)  24,5 % nitrogen content by weight as a result of ammonium nitrate corresponds to 70 % ammonium nitrate.\n(6)  OJ L 304, 21.11.2003, p. 1.\n(7)  28 % nitrogen content by weight as a result of ammonium nitrate corresponds to 80 % ammonium nitrate.\nANNEX II\nMinimum data and information to be considered in the safety report referred to in Article 10\n1.\nInformation on the management system and on the organisation of the establishment with a view to major-accident prevention.\nThis information shall contain the elements indicated in Annex III.\n2.\nPresentation of the environment of the establishment:\n(a)\ndescription of the establishment and its environment including the geographical location, meteorological, geological, hydrographic conditions and, if necessary, its history;\n(b)\nidentification of installations and other activities of the establishment which could present a major-accident hazard;\n(c)\non the basis of available information, identification of neighbouring establishments, as well as sites that fall outside the scope of this Directive, areas and developments that could be the source of, or increase the risk or consequences of a major accident and of domino effects;\n(d)\ndescription of areas where a major accident may occur.\n3.\nDescription of the installation:\n(a)\ndescription of the main activities and products of the parts of the establishment which are important from the point of view of safety, sources of major-accident risks and conditions under which such a major accident could happen, together with a description of proposed preventive measures;\n(b)\ndescription of processes, in particular the operating methods;

dangerous substances\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt aims to control major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, especially chemicals.\nThis Directive, so-called Seveso-III, amended the previous Seveso-II (Directive 96/82/EC), which, in view of the lessons learned from later accidents such as Bhopal, Toulouse or Enschede, had amended the original Seveso-Directive (Directive 82/501/EEC), after the catastrophic accident in the Italian town of Seveso in 1976 prompted the adoption of legislation on the prevention and control of such accidents.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThis legislation has been changed to give the public stronger rights. It provides them with better access to information about the risks which might occur from nearby industrial installations and how to react in the event of an accident.That information, which explains how alerts will be sounded and how the public should act, must be available online.\nWhat has changed?The law now covers some 12,000 industrial sites across the EU where chemicals or petrochemicals are used or stored, or where metal refining takes place.\nEvery EU country must ensure measures are in place to deal with accidents in areas around industrial installations housing large quantities of dangerous products:\nCompanies handling these substances above certain thresholds must:\nregularly inform the people who could be affected by an accident\nprovide safety reports\nestablish a safety management system\nput in place an internal emergency plan.\nThe new law also:\ntightens the procedures for public consultation on projects, plans and programmes involving plants covered by the legislation.\nensures, through changes to land-use planning laws, that new plants are sited a safe distance away from existing ones.\nallows people to go to court if they consider they have not been properly informed or involved.\nintroduces stricter inspection standards for the various installations, to ensure the safety rules are being effectively implemented.\nWhy the update?The latest legislation takes account of certain technical European and international changes in the way chemicals are classified.\nBackground\nConsidering the very high rate of industrialisation in the EU, the Seveso Directive has contributed to achieving a low frequency of major accidents. The Directive is widely considered as a benchmark for industrial accident policy and has been a role model for legislation in many countries worldwide.\nFor more information, please see:\nMajor accident hazards (European Commission)\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 13 August 2012. EU countries must apply the new rules from 1 June 2015.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2012/18/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, amending and subsequently repealing Council Directive 96/82/EC (OJ L 197, 24.7.2012, pp. 1-37)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nReport from the Commission on the application in the Member States of Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances for the period 2012-2014 (COM(2017) 665 final of 16 November 2017)\nlast update 04.06.2018", "tags": ["environmental impact", "public health", "industrial hazard", "dangerous substance", "accident prevention"], "subjects": ["Public health", "Environment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32012L0018_p1": {"text": "directive 2012/18/eu OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 4 July 2012---on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, amending and subsequently repealing Council directive 96/82/ec", "triples": [" directive 2012/18/eu,  amending,  directive 96/82/ec", " directive 2012/18/eu,  repealing,  directive 96/82/ec"]}, "32012L0018_p3": {"text": "Annex I to directive 96/82/ec lists the dangerous substances falling within its scope, inter alia, by reference to certain provisions of Council directive 67/548/eec of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (6) as well as directive 1999/45/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (7). directive 67/548/eec directive 1999/45/ec have been replaced by regulation 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (8), which implements within the Union the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals that has been adopted at international level, within the structure of the United Nations (UN).
