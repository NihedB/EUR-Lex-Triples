{"celex_id": "32014L0090", "reference": "28.8.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 257/146\nDIRECTIVE 2014/90/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 July 2014\non marine equipment and repealing Council Directive 96/98/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe global dimension of shipping calls for the Union to apply and support the international regulatory framework for maritime safety. The international maritime safety conventions require flag States to ensure that the equipment carried on board ships complies with certain safety requirements as regards design, construction and performance, and to issue the relevant certificates. To that end, detailed performance and testing standards for certain types of marine equipment have been developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and by the international and European standardisation bodies.\n(2)\nThe international instruments leave a significant margin of discretion to the flag administrations. In the absence of harmonisation, this leads to varying levels of safety for products which the competent national authorities have certified as complying with those conventions and standards; as a result, the smooth functioning of the internal market is affected as it becomes difficult for the Member States to accept equipment certified in another Member State to be placed on board ships flying their flags without further verification.\n(3)\nHarmonisation by the Union resolves these problems. Council Directive 96/98/EC (3) thus laid down common rules to eliminate differences in the implementation of international standards by means of a clearly identified set of requirements and uniform certification procedures.\n(4)\nThere are various other instruments of Union law which lay down requirements and conditions, inter alia, in order to ensure the free movement of goods within the internal market or for environmental purposes, for certain products which are similar in nature to equipment used on board ships but which do not meet the international standards â€“ which may substantially differ from the internal legislation of the Union and are in constant evolution. Those products cannot therefore be certified by the Member States in accordance with the relevant international maritime safety conventions. Equipment to be placed onboard EU ships in accordance with international safety standards should therefore be regulated exclusively by this Directive, which should in any event be considered the lex specialis; furthermore, a specific marking should be established to indicate that equipment bearing that mark complies with the requirements laid down in the relevant international conventions and instruments which have entered into force.\n(5)\nAs well as setting out detailed performance and testing standards for marine equipment, the international instruments sometimes allow for measures that deviate from the prescriptive requirements but which, under certain conditions, are suitable to satisfy the intent of those requirements. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, allows for alternative designs and arrangements which could be applied by individual Member States acting under their own responsibility.\n(6)\nExperience in the implementation of Directive 96/98/EC has shown that it is necessary to take additional measures in order to enhance the implementation and enforcement mechanisms of that Directive and simplify the regulatory environment while guaranteeing that IMO requirements are applied and implemented in a harmonised way across the Union.\n(7)\nRequirements should therefore be established for marine equipment to meet the safety standards laid down in the applicable international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, in order to ensure that equipment which complies with those requirements can circulate unimpeded within the internal market and be placed on board ships flying the flag of any Member State.\n(8)\nIn order to allow for fair competition in the development of marine equipment, every effort should be made to promote the use of open standards in order to make them available freely or at a nominal charge, and permissible to all to copy, distribute and use for no fee or at a nominal fee.\n(9)\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. That Decision constitutes a general framework of a horizontal nature for future legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products and a reference text for existing legislation. That general framework provides appropriate solutions to the problems identified in the implementation of Directive 96/98/EC. It is therefore necessary to incorporate the definitions and reference provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC into this Directive by making the adaptations which are required by the specific features of the marine equipment sector.\n(10)\nIn order to provide market surveillance authorities with additional, specific means to facilitate their task, an electronic tag could supplement or replace the wheel mark in due time.\n(11)\nThe responsibilities of the economic operators should be laid down in a way which is proportionate and non-discriminatory for those economic operators who are established within the Union, taking into account the fact that a significant proportion of the marine equipment falling within the scope of this Directive may never be imported and distributed in the territory of the Member States.\n(12)\nGiven that marine equipment is placed on board ships at the time of their construction or repair all over the world, market surveillance becomes particularly difficult and cannot be effectively supported by border controls. Therefore, the respective obligations of Member States and of economic operators within the Union should be clearly specified. Member States should ensure that only compliant equipment is installed on board ships flying their flags and that this obligation is fulfilled through issuance, endorsement or renewal of the certificates of such ships by the flag State administration under the international conventions, as well as through national market surveillance arrangements in place in accordance with the Union market surveillance framework laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Member States should be supported in fulfilling those obligations by the information systems made available by the Commission for the assessment, notification and monitoring of bodies authorised to carry out conformity assessment tasks, the sharing of information in relation to approved marine equipment, applications withdrawn or refused, and non-compliance of equipment.\n(13)\nIn the first instance, the affixing of the wheel mark to the marine equipment by the manufacturer or, where relevant, the importer should be the guarantee pursuant to their obligations under this Directive that the equipment is compliant and may be placed on the market with a view to being placed on board an EU ship. Thereafter, certain provisions are necessary for the safe continuation and applicability of the wheel mark after it has been affixed and for the effective discharge of the task of national market surveillance authorities. The manufacturer or, where relevant, the importer or the distributor, should be obliged to provide the competent authorities with full and truthful information in relation to the equipment it has wheel marked to ensure that marine equipment remains safe. The manufacturer should be obliged to cooperate with market surveillance authorities, including as regard standards against which it has manufactured and certified equipment, and should also exercise due diligence in relation to marine equipment it places on the market. In this regard, a manufacturer located outside the Union should appoint an authorised representative in order to ensure cooperation with competent national authorities.\n(14)\nCompliance with international testing standards could best be demonstrated by means of conformity assessment procedures such as those laid down in Decision No 768/2008/EC. However, only those conformity assessment procedures which meet the requirements of the international instruments should be made available to manufacturers.\n(15)\nIn order to ensure a fair and efficient procedure when examining suspected non-compliance, the Member States should be encouraged to take all measures conducive to an exhaustive and objective evaluation of the risks;. if the Commission is satisfied that this condition has been met, it should not be obliged to repeat that evaluation when reviewing the restrictive measures adopted by the Member States as regards non-compliant equipment.\n(16)\nWhen performing its investigative duties with regard to notified bodies, the Commission should keep Member States informed and should cooperate with them as far as possible, taking due account of its independent role.\n(17)\nWhen the surveillance authorities of a Member State consider that marine equipment covered by this Directive is liable to present a risk to maritime safety, to health or to the environment, they should carry out evaluations or tests in relation to the equipment concerned. In cases where a risk is detected, the Member State should call upon the economic operator concerned to take the appropriate corrective action, or even to withdraw or recall the equipment concerned.\n(18)\nThe use of marine equipment not bearing the wheel mark should be allowed in exceptional circumstances, especially when it is not possible for a ship to obtain equipment bearing the wheel mark in a port or installation outside the Union or when equipment bearing the wheel mark is not available in the market.\n(19)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the attainment of the objectives of this Directive is not impaired by the absence of international standards or serious weaknesses or anomalies in existing standards, including testing standards, for specific items of marine equipment falling within the scope of this Directive. It is also necessary to identify the specific items of marine equipment which could benefit from electronic tagging. Moreover, it is necessary to keep up to date a non-essential element of this Directive, namely the references to standards as referred to in Annex III, when new standards become available. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should therefore be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption, under certain conditions and on an interim basis, of harmonised technical specifications and testing standards and in order to amend those references. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(20)\nIn order to meet the objectives of this Directive, the international instruments should be uniformly implemented in the internal market. It is therefore necessary, for each item of marine equipment for which the approval of the flag State is required by the international conventions, to identify in a clear and timely way the design, construction and performance requirements as well as the associated testing standards laid down in the international instruments for that equipment, and to adopt common criteria and procedures, including timeframes, for the implementation of those requirements and standards by notified bodies, Member State authorities and economic operators, including any operator responsible for placing equipment on board an EU ship. It is also necessary to ensure that the attainment of the objectives of this Directive is not impaired by shortcomings in the applicable technical specifications and testing standards or in cases where the IMO has failed to produce appropriate standards for marine equipment falling within the scope of this Directive.\n(21)\nThe international instruments, with the exception of testing standards, should automatically apply in their up-to-date version. In order to mitigate the risk that the introduction of new testing standards into Union legislation causes disproportionate difficulties for the Union fleet and for economic operators, from the standpoint of clarity and legal certainty, the entry into force of such new testing standards should not be automatic but, rather, should be explicitly indicated by the Commission.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(23)\nIn order to facilitate a harmonised, rapid and simple implementation of this Directive, implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Directive should take the form of Commission Regulations.\n(24)\nIn line with established practice, the committee referred to in this Directive can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Directive raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure.\n(25)\nWhen matters relating to this Directive, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined, for example, in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should, in line with existing practice, receive full information and documentation and, where appropriate, an invitation to attend meetings.\n(26)\nThe Commission is assisted by the European Maritime Safety Agency, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), in the effective implementation of relevant binding legal acts of the Union and in the performance of the tasks therein entrusted to the Commission.\n(27)\nThe competent authorities and all economic operators should make all possible efforts to facilitate written communication in accordance with international practice, with a view to finding common means of communication.\n(28)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely to enhance safety at sea and the prevention of marine pollution through the uniform application of the relevant international instruments relating to equipment to be placed on board ships, and to ensure the free movement of such equipment within the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(29)\nThe measures to be adopted represent a major modification of the provisions of Directive 96/98/EC and therefore, in the interests of clarity, that Directive should be repealed and replaced by this Directive,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThe objective of this Directive is to enhance safety at sea and to prevent marine pollution through the uniform

Marine equipment the compliance of which with the requirements laid down in this Directive has been demonstrated in accordance with the relevant conformity assessment procedures shall have the wheel mark affixed to it.\n2.   The wheel mark shall not be affixed to any other product.\n3.   The form of the wheel mark to be used shall be as set out in Annex I.\n4.   Use of the wheel mark shall be subject to the general principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 3 to 6 of Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, where any reference to the CE marking shall be construed as a reference to the wheel mark.\nArticle 10\nRules and conditions for affixing the wheel mark\n1.   The wheel mark shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the product or to its data plate and, where relevant, embedded in its software. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the product, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents.\n2.   The wheel mark shall be affixed at the end of the production phase.\n3.   The wheel mark shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body, where that body is involved in the production control phase, and by the year in which the mark is affixed.\n4.   The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or the manufacturer's authorised representative.\nArticle 11\nElectronic tag\n1.   In order to facilitate market surveillance and prevent the counterfeiting of specific items of marine equipment referred to in paragraph 3, manufacturers may use an appropriate and reliable form of electronic tag instead of, or in addition to, the wheel mark. In such a case, Articles 9 and 10 shall apply, as appropriate, mutatis mutandis.\n2.   The Commission shall carry out a cost-benefit analysis concerning the use of the electronic tag as a supplement to, or a replacement of, the wheel mark.\n3.   The Commission may adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 37, in order to identify the specific items of marine equipment which can benefit from electronic tagging. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out consultations with experts, including Member Statesâ€™ experts, during the preparation of such delegated acts.\n4.   Implementing powers shall be conferred upon the Commission in order to lay down, in the form of Commission Regulations and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 38(2), appropriate technical criteria as regards the design, performance, affixing and use of electronic tags.\n5.   For the equipment identified in accordance with paragraph 3, the wheel mark may, within three years after the date of adoption of the appropriate technical criteria referred to in paragraph 4, be supplemented by an appropriate and reliable form of electronic tag.\n6.   For the equipment identified in accordance with paragraph 3, the wheel mark may be replaced, five years after the date of adoption of the appropriate technical criteria referred to in paragraph 4, by an appropriate and reliable form of electronic tag.\nCHAPTER 3\nOBLIGATIONS OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS\nArticle 12\nObligations of manufacturers\n1.   By affixing the wheel mark, manufacturers shall take on responsibility for guaranteeing that the marine equipment to which the mark is affixed has been designed and manufactured in accordance with the technical specifications and standards implemented in accordance with Article 35(2), and shall assume the obligations laid down in paragraphs 2 to 9 of this Article.\n2.   Manufacturers shall draw up the required technical documentation and have the applicable conformity assessment procedures carried out.\n3.   Where the compliance of marine equipment with the applicable requirements has been demonstrated by the conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up an EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 16 and affix the wheel mark in accordance with Articles 9 and 10.\n4.   Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity referred to in Article 16 for at least 10 years after the wheel mark has been affixed and in no case for a period shorter than the expected life of the marine equipment concerned.\n5.   Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for series production to remain in conformity. Changes in marine equipment design or characteristics and changes in the requirements in the international instruments as referred to in Article 4, on the basis of which conformity of marine equipment is declared, shall be taken into account. When necessary in accordance with Annex II, manufacturers shall have a new conformity assessment carried out.\n6.   Manufacturers shall ensure that their products bear a type, batch or serial number or other element allowing their identification, or, where the size or nature of the product does not allow it, that the required information is provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the product or both, as appropriate.\n7.   Manufacturers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the address at which they can be contacted on the product or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the product or both, as appropriate. The address must indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted.\n8.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the product is accompanied by instructions and all necessary information for safe installation on board and safe use of the product, including limitations of use, if any, that can be easily understood by the users, together with any other documentation required by the international instruments or testing standards.\n9.   Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that a product to which they have affixed the wheel mark is not in conformity with the applicable design, construction and performance requirements and with the testing standards implemented in accordance with Article 35(2) and (3), shall immediately take the necessary corrective measures to bring that product into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, if appropriate. In addition, where the product presents a risk, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n10.   Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent authority, promptly provide it with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product, in a language which can be easily understood by or is acceptable to that authority, grant that authority access to their premises for market surveillance purposes in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and provide samples or access to samples in accordance with Article 25(4) of this Directive. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by products which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 13\nAuthorised representatives\n1.   A manufacturer who is not located in the territory of at least one Member State shall, by a written mandate, appoint an authorised representative for the Union and shall indicate in the mandate the name of the authorised representative and the address at which it can be contacted.\n2.

As regards marine equipment, the Member States shall undertake market surveillance in accordance with the EU market surveillance framework laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.\n2.   National market surveillance infrastructures and programmes shall take into account the specific features of the marine equipment sector, including the various procedures carried out as part of the conformity assessment, and in particular the responsibilities placed on the flag State administration by the international conventions.\n3.   Market surveillance may include documentary checks as well as checks of marine equipment which bears the wheel mark, whether or not it has been placed on board ships. Checks of marine equipment already placed on board shall be limited to such examination as can be carried out while the equipment concerned remains fully functional on board.\n4.   Where the market surveillance authorities of a Member State, as defined in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, intend to carry out sample checks, they may, when it is reasonable and practicable to do so, request the manufacturer to make the necessary samples available or to give on-the-spot access to the samples at the manufacturerâ€™s own cost.\nArticle 26\nProcedure for dealing with marine equipment presenting a risk at national level\n1.   Where the market surveillance authorities of a Member State have sufficient reason to believe that marine equipment covered by this Directive presents a risk to maritime safety, to health or to the environment, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the marine equipment concerned covering all the requirements laid down in this Directive. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities.\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authorities find that the marine equipment does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the marine equipment into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the marine equipment from the market, or to recall it within such reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory or to ships flying their flag, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, by means of the information system made available by the Commission for market surveillance purposes, of the results of the evaluation carried out under paragraph 1 and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the products concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union or, as the case may be, placed or delivered to be placed on board EU ships.\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period prescribed by the market surveillance authorities in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, or otherwise fails to meet its obligations under this Directive, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the marine equipment being made available on their national market or placed on board ships flying their flag, to withdraw the product from that market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n5.   The information on the measures taken by the market surveillance authorities referred to in paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant marine equipment, the origin of the product, the nature of the alleged non-compliance and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the economic operator concerned. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either:\n(a)\nfailure of the marine equipment to comply with the applicable design, construction and performance requirements as laid down pursuant to Article 4;\n(b)\nnon-compliance with the testing standards referred to in Article 4 during the conformity assessment procedure;\n(c)\nshortcomings in those testing standards.\n6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the marine equipment concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within four months of receipt of the information concerning the measures taken by the market surveillance authorities, as referred to in paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by a Member State or by the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures in respect of the marine equipment concerned, such as withdrawal of the product from their market, are taken without delay.\nArticle 27\nEU safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 26(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers that a national measure may be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the relevant national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether or not the relevant national measure is justified.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, where the Commission is satisfied that the procedure followed in the adoption of the national measure is appropriate for an exhaustive and objective evaluation of the risk and that the national measure complies with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, it may limit itself to examining the appropriateness and proportionality of the relevant national measure in relation to the said risk.\n3.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator or operators.\n4.   If the relevant national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant marine equipment is withdrawn from their market, and, where necessary, recalled. They shall inform the Commission accordingly.\n5.   If the relevant national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw it.\n6.   Where the non-compliance of the marine equipment is attributed to shortcomings in the testing standards referred to in Article 4, the Commission may, in order to fulfil the objective of this Directive, confirm, modify or revoke a national safeguard measure by means of implementing acts in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 38(2).\nThe Commission shall furthermore be empowered to adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 37, interim harmonised requirements and testing standards for that specific item of marine equipment. The criteria laid down in Article 8(3) shall apply accordingly. These requirements and testing standards shall be made accessible free of charge by the Commission.\n7.   Where the testing standard concerned is a European standard, the Commission shall inform the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and shall bring the matter before the committee set up by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC. That committee shall consult the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and deliver its opinion without delay.\nArticle 28\nCompliant products which present a risk to maritime safety, to health or to the environment\n1.   Where, having performed an evaluation under Article 26(1), a Member State finds that marine equipment which is in compliance with this Directive nevertheless presents a risk to maritime safety, to health or to the environment, it shall require the economic operator concerned to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the marine equipment concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the marine equipment from the market or to recall it within such reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the products concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union or placed on board EU ships.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. The information provided shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the marine equipment concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the marine equipment, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether or not the measure is justified and shall where necessary propose appropriate measures. Article 27(2) shall apply mutatis mutandis for this purpose.\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator or operators.\nArticle 29\nFormal non-compliance\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 26, where a Member State makes one of the following findings, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned:\n(a)\nthe wheel mark has been affixed in violation of Article 9 or Article 10;\n(b)\nthe wheel mark has not been affixed;\n(c)\nthe EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up;\n(d)\nthe EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up correctly;\n(e)\ntechnical documentation is either not available or not complete;\n(f)\nthe EU declaration of conformity has not been sent to the ship.\n2.   Where the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 1 persists, the Member State concerned shall take all appropriate measures to restrict or to prohibit the marine equipment being made available on the market or to ensure that it is recalled or withdrawn from the market.\nArticle 30\nExemptions based on technical innovation\n1.   In exceptional circumstances of technical innovation, the flag State administration may permit marine equipment which does not comply with the conformity assessment procedures to be placed on board an EU ship if it is established by trial or otherwise to the satisfaction of the flag State administration that such equipment meets the objectives of this Directive.\n2.   The trial procedures shall in no way discriminate between marine equipment produced in the flag Member State and marine equipment produced in other States.\n3.   Marine equipment covered by this Article shall be given a certificate by the flag Member State which shall at all times be carried with the equipment and which gives the flag Member Stateâ€™s permission for the equipment to be placed on board the ship and imposes any restrictions or lays down any provisions relating to the use of the equipment.\n4.   Where a Member State allows marine equipment covered by this Article to be placed on board an EU ship, that Member State shall forthwith communicate the particulars thereof together with the reports of all relevant trials, assessments and conformity assessment procedures to the Commission and to the other Member States.\n5.   Within 12 months of receipt of the communication referred to in paragraph 4, the Commission, if it considers that the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 are not met, may require the Member State concerned to withdraw the permission granted within a specified deadline. For this purpose, the Commission shall act by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 38(2).\n6.   Where a ship with marine equipment on board which is covered by paragraph 1 is transferred to another Member State, the receiving flag Member State may take the necessary measures, which may include tests and practical demonstrations, to ensure that the equipment is at least as effective as equipment which does comply with the conformity assessment procedures.\nArticle 31\nExemptions for testing or evaluation\nA flag State administration may permit marine equipment which does not comply with the conformity assessment procedures or which is not covered by Article 30 to be placed on board an EU ship for reasons of testing or evaluation, if the following cumulative conditions are complied with:\n(a)\nthe marine equipment shall be given a certificate by the flag Member State which shall at all times be carried with the equipment, state that Member Stateâ€™s permission for the equipment to be placed on board the EU ship, impose all necessary restrictions and lay down any other appropriate provisions as regards the use of the equipment concerned;\n(b)\nthe permission shall be limited to the period considered by the flag State as being necessary to complete the testing, which should be as short as possible;\n(c)\nthe marine equipment shall not be relied on in place of equipment which meets the requirements of this Directive and shall not replace such equipment, which shall remain on board the EU ship in working order and ready for immediate use.\nArticle 32\nExemptions in exceptional circumstances\n1.   In exceptional circumstances, which shall be duly justified to the flag State administration, when marine equipment needs to be replaced in a port outside the Union where it is not practicable in terms of reasonable time, delay and cost to place on board equipment which bears the wheel mark, other marine equipment may be placed on board subject to paragraphs 2 to 4.\n2.   The marine equipment placed on board shall be accompanied by documentation issued by a Member State of the IMO which is a party to the relevant conventions, certifying compliance with the relevant IMO requirements.\n3.   The flag State administration shall be informed at once of the nature and characteristics of such other marine equipment.\n4.   The flag State administration shall, at the earliest opportunity, ensure that the marine equipment referred to in paragraph 1, along with its testing documentation, complies with the relevant requirements of the international instruments and of this Directive.\n5.   Where it has been demonstrated that specific marine equipment bearing the wheel mark is not available on the market, the flag Member State may authorise other marine equipment to be placed on board, subject to paragraphs 6 to 8.\n6.   The authorised marine equipment shall comply, as much as possible, with the requirements and testing standards referred to in Article 4.\n7.   The marine equipment placed on board shall be accompanied by an interim certificate of approval issued by the flag Member State or by another Member State, stating the following:\n(a)\nthe equipment bearing the wheel mark which the certified equipment is due to replace;\n(b)\nthe exact circumstances under which the certificate of approval has been issued, and in particular the unavailability in the market of equipment bearing the wheel mark;\n(c)\nthe exact design, construction and performance requirements against which the equipment has been approved by the certifying Member State;\n(d)\nthe testing standards applied, if any, in the relevant approval procedures.\n8.   The Member State issuing an interim certificate of approval shall inform the Commission forthwith. If the Commission considers that the conditions of paragraphs 6 and 7 have not been met, it may require that Member State to revoke that certificate or take other appropriate measures by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 38(2).\nCHAPTER 6\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 33\nExchange of experience\nThe Commission shall provide for the organisation of exchanges of experience between the Member Statesâ€™ national authorities responsible for notification policy, especially as regards market surveillance.\nArticle 34\nCoordination of notified bodies\n1.

This should make it easier to prevent counterfeiting and to monitor the market.\nEU countries have to undertake market surveillance on an adequate scale.\nIf national authorities believe an equipment covered by the legislation presents a risk to maritime safety, peopleâ€™s health or the environment, or if it does not comply with the legislation, its supplier must withdraw it.\nThe European Commission has adopted the following delegated and implementing acts:\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2018/414 supplements Directive 2014/90/EU as regards the identification of specific items of marine equipment which can benefit from electronic tagging. A costâ€“benefit analysis concerning the use of electronic tags as a supplement to or replacement of the wheel mark carried out by the Commission demonstrated that, due to the electronic tagging of marine equipment: manufacturers should benefit from an improved prevention of counterfeiting; shipowners and operators should be able to carry out equipment traceability and stock control more easily; and market surveillance authorities should benefit from direct and easy access to the relevant databases, which will improve the validation checks of certificates. The analysis concluded that overall investments will be low compared to the expected benefits and that costs for authorities and industry are affordable because of a possible step-wise voluntary implementation.\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2018/608 lays down technical criteria for electronic tags for marine equipment.\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1170 lays down rules on design, construction and performance requirements and testing standards for marine equipment and repeals Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1397.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 17 September 2014 and had to become law in the EU countries by 18 September 2016.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nInternational maritime safety conventions require countries to ensure that the equipment on ships sailing under their flag meet certain design, construction and performance standards.\nHowever, countries are given a significant degree of discretion in how they do this, which can lead to varying levels of safety and could disrupt the free flow of goods across the EU.\nBy implementing standardised EU certification rules, these problems are avoided and the single market works as it was designed to. Moreover, crew and passengers of ships bearing the flag of an EU country can be sure that the wheel-marked equipment on board has been tested and certified in accordance with the applicable safety and environmental standards.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on marine equipment and repealing Council Directive 96/98/EC (OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, pp. 146-185)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2014/90/EU have been incorporated into the original text.
