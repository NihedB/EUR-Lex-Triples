Furthermore, in the absence of specific Union or national rules, the name under which a food is sold should be the name customary in the Member State in which it is sold, or a description of the food which is clear enough to let the purchaser know its true nature.\n(4)\nMoreover, all ingredients must be mentioned on the label of pre-packaged foodstuffs intended for the final consumer or mass caterers. In particular, foods containing meat as an ingredient, when intended for the final consumer or mass caterers, must also indicate the animal species from which the meat originates directly on the package or on a label attached thereto. If an ingredient is mentioned in the name of the food, its quantity expressed as a percentage must also be provided in the list of ingredients in order to avoid the consumer being misled as regards the identity and the composition of the food.\n(5)\nRegulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (3) provides for additional labelling requirements applicable to specific foods. In particular, it provides that packages intended for supply to the final consumer containing minced meat, amongst others, from solipeds are to bear a notice indicating that such products should be cooked before consumption, if, and to the extent that, national rules in the Member State in the territory of which the product is placed on the market so require.\n(6)\nSection III of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 requires the food business operators operating slaughterhouses to request, receive, check and act upon food chain information in respect of all animals, other than wild game, sent or intended to be sent to the slaughterhouse. The relevant food chain information is to cover, in particular, veterinary medicinal products administered to the animals within a relevant period and with a withdrawal period greater than zero, together with their dates of administration and withdrawal periods. Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4) requires, inter alia, the official veterinarian to perform auditing and inspection tasks. In particular, the official veterinarian is to check and analyse relevant information from the records of the holding of provenance of animals intended for slaughter, including food chain information and to take account of the documented results of this check and analysis when carrying out ante- and post-mortem inspection.\n(7)\nFollowing official controls being carried out since December 2012 in a number of Member States, the Commission was informed that certain pre-packaged products contained horsemeat, which was not declared in the list of ingredients appearing directly on the package or on a label attached thereto. Instead, the name of certain such foods and/or the accompanying list of ingredients misleadingly referred solely to the presence of beef.\n(8)\nIn accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (5), food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law which are relevant to their activities and must verify that such requirements are met.\n(9)\nHorses are animal species that can be ‘food producing’ or ‘non-food producing’. Phenylbutazone is a veterinary drug whose use is allowed only in non-food producing animals pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (6). Accordingly, non-food producing horses, which have been treated with phenylbutazone at some point in their life, cannot enter the food chain. Considering the fraudulent practices relating to the unlabelled presence of horsemeat in certain food products, it is appropriate, for preventive purposes, to ascertain whether non-food producing horses treated with phenylbutazone have entered the food chain.\n(10)\nIt is therefore necessary for the Commission to recommend to the Member States to carry out a coordinated control plan with a view to establish the prevalence of fraudulent practices in the marketing of certain foods for a period of one month. This period may be extended by an additional period of two months.\n(11)\nThe recommended control plan should consist of two actions.\n(12)\nThe first action should consist of appropriate controls carried out at retail level, on foods destined for the final consumer or mass caterers, which are marketed and/or labelled as containing beef. These controls could also be extended to other establishments (e.g. cold stores). The objective of these controls would be to establish whether such products contain horsemeat, which is not properly labelled on the packaging or, in the case of non-pre-packaged foodstuffs, whether information relating to its presence is not made available to the consumer or mass caterers. Such controls should be carried out on a representative sample.\n(13)\nReliable methods exist which allow with a sufficient degree of accuracy the detection of the presence of proteins of undeclared species in a sample. The European Union Reference Laboratory for animal proteins in feedstuffs can provide useful advice on those methods and their use. The competent authorities should be invited to rely on the advice of that laboratory as to the methods that can be used.\n(14)\nThe second action should consist of appropriate controls being carried out in establishments handling horsemeat destined for human consumption, including foods originating from third countries, for the detection of phenylbutazone residues. These controls should also be carried out on a representative sample, taking into account production and import figures. It is appropriate in this case to refer to methods provided for by Commission Decision 2002/657/EC of 12 August 2002 implementing Council Directive 96/23/EC concerning the performance of analytical methods and the interpretation of results (7).\n(15)\nThe Member States should communicate the results of these controls to the Commission on a regular basis, in order to assess the findings and decide on an appropriate course of action.\n(16)\nAfter consulting the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION:\nMember States should apply a coordinated control plan, in accordance with the Annex to this Recommendation, consisting of the following actions:\n(a)\nofficial controls on foods destined for the final consumer or mass caterers, which are marketed and/or labelled as containing beef; and\n(b)\nofficial controls on horsemeat destined for human consumption to detect phenylbutazone residues.\nDone at Brussels, 19 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)  OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(2)  OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29.\n(3)  OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(4)  OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 206.\n(5)  OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.\n(6)  OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1.\n(7)  OJ L 221, 17.8.2002, p. 8.\nANNEX\nCoordinated control plan with a view to establish the prevalence of fraudulent practices in the marketing of certain foods\nI.

The labelling on these foods misleadingly referred solely to the presence of beef, an ingredient whose price is considerably higher than that of horsemeat.\nHorsemeat is a legitimate ingredient in its own right if derived from food-producing horses slaughtered in approved abattoirs and if it passes the necessary veterinary inspections. The issue was further compounded by the fact that the use of the veterinary drug phenylbutazone is permitted in the case of the non-food producing horses. It was feared that horsemeat from these origins had entered the human food chain.\nThese circumstances led to the European authorities (European Commission and the European Food Safety Authority), together with the Member States’ competent authorities, aided by Europol, working closely together to investigate the extent of the problem, develop a plan to address it and restore consumers’ confidence in the food they buy.\nA coordinated Europe-wide control plan to establish the prevalence of fraudulent practices was drawn up by the Commission and national authorities had to take two actions:\ncontrols of food marketed and/or labelled as containing beef to see if it contained horsemeat;\ncontrols of horsemeat destined for human consumption to detect the possible presence of phenylbutazone residues.\nAll positive results had to be immediately notified to the Commission and were further relayed throughout the EU by means of the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF).\nThis coordinated EU-wide action yielded rapid results with the identification of those involved in the food production chain and a recall of the products that were identified.\nFurther actions taken include:\nthe establishment within the Commission’s department responsible for health and consumers (DG Health and Consumers) of an EU food fraud team;\nthe adoption in May 2013 by the Commission of a package of proposals to strengthen the enforcement of health and safety standards for the whole agri-food chain; these proposals would, among other things, require member countries to fully integrate anti-fraud checks into their national control plans and ensure that financial penalties in case of fraud are set at dissuasive levels;\na report on the possibility of extending mandatory origin labelling for meat used as an ingredient in pre-packed foods to be prepared by the Commission under a new EU law on food information for consumers, which comes into force in December 2014, was brought forward to December 2013. The Commission is considering whether to table a legislative proposal.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRecommendation 2013/99/EU\n-\n-\nOJ L 48 of 21.2.2013\nProposals\nProposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on animal health.
