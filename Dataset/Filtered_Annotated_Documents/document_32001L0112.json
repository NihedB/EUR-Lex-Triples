It should be clearly indicated when a product is a mixture of fruit juice and fruit juice from concentrate, and, for fruit nectar, when it is obtained entirely or partly from a concentrated product. The list of ingredients in the labelling bears the names of both the fruit juices and fruit juices from concentrate used.(8) Subject to Council Directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs(7), the addition of vitamins to the products defined by this Directive is permitted in some Member States. However, the extension of this possibility to the whole of the Community is not envisaged. Therefore, Member States are free to authorise or prohibit the addition of vitamins and also minerals as part of the manufacturing process. In all circumstances, however, the principle of the free movement of products within the Community should be observed in accordance with the rules and principles laid down in the Treaty.(9) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality established by Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of laying down common definitions and rules for the products concerned and bringing the provisions into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the nature of this Directive, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the said objective.(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8).(11) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1This Directive shall apply to the products defined in Annex I.Article 2Member States may, subject to Directive 90/496/EEC, authorise the addition of vitamins and minerals to the products defined in part I of Annex I hereto.Article 3Directive 2000/13/EC shall apply to the products defined in Annex I, subject to the following conditions:1. (a) The product names listed in Annex I shall apply only to the products referred to therein and shall, without prejudice to subparagraph (b), be used in trade to designate them.(b) As an alternative to the product names referred to in subparagraph (a), Annex III provides a list of particular designations. These designations may be used in the language and under the conditions laid down in Annex III.2. If the product comes from a single kind of fruit, the name of the latter shall be substituted for the word \"fruit\".3. For products manufactured from two or more fruits, except where lemon juice is used under the conditions laid down in part II.1 of Annex I, the product names shall be supplemented by a list of the fruits used, in descending order of the volume of the fruit juices or purées included. However, in the case of products manufactured from three or more fruits, the indication of the fruits used may be replaced by the words \"several fruits\" or a similar wording, or by the number of fruits used.4. For fruit juices which have been sweetened by the addition of sugars, the sales name shall include the word \"sweetened\" or \"with added sugar\", followed by an indication of the maximum quantity of sugar added, calculated as dry matter and expressed in grams per litre.5. The restoration of the products defined in part I of Annex I to their original state, by means of the substances strictly necessary for this operation, shall not entail an obligation to enter on the labels a list of the ingredients used for this purpose.The addition to fruit juice of extra pulp or cells as defined in Annex II shall be indicated on the labelling.6. Without prejudice to Article 7(2) and (5) of Directive 2000/13/EC for mixtures of fruit juice and fruit juice from concentrate, and for fruit nectar obtained entirely or partly from one or more concentrated products, the labelling shall bear the words \"made with concentrate(s)\" or \"partially made with concentrate(s)\", as appropriate. That information shall be entered close to the product name, standing out well from any background, in clearly visible characters.7. For fruit nectars, the labelling shall indicate the minimum content of fruit juice, fruit purée or any mixture of those ingredients, by the declaration \"fruit content: ... % minimum\". That information shall be located in the same field of vision as the product name.Article 4The labelling of concentrated fruit juice referred to in part I point 2 of Annex I not intended for delivery to the final consumer shall bear a reference indicating the presence and quantity of added sugars, or added lemon juice or acidifying agents as permitted by Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(9). This reference shall appear on the packaging, on a label attached to the packaging or on an accompanying document.Article 5For the products defined in Annex I, Member States shall not adopt national provisions not provided for by this Directive.Article 6Without prejudice to Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption(10), only the treatments and substances listed in part II of Annex I and the raw materials complying with Annex II may be used to manufacture the products defined in part I of Annex I. Moreover, fruit nectars shall comply with the provisions of Annex IV.Article 7The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive relating to the matters referred to below shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 8(2):- bringing this Directive into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs,- adaptations to technical progress.Article 81. The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs (hereinafter referred to as \"the Committee\") set up by Article 1 of Decision 69/414/EEC(11).2.

The directive also defines particular (traditional) designations used in certain countries and languages.\nLabelling\nFruit juices are labelled in accordance with the general rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the labelling of foodstuffs (see summary). However, additional, specific rules are adopted in this directive in order to improve consumer information. These require to make it clear in the product name: if a product is a mixture of different fruits;if a product has been obtained entirely or partly from a concentrate.\nSince amending Directive 2012/12/EU was adopted, the addition of sugars is no longer authorised in fruit juices. For other products, added sugars should continue to be labelled in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. Since the addition of sugars was previously allowed, it was common that some food-business operators labelled the absence of added sugars in the fruit juices for commercial reasons by means of nutrition claim ‘with no added sugars’. The use of this claim was disallowed after the end of a transitional period of 18 months.\nTo enable the industry to properly inform consumers both during the transitional period and another 18 months after its end, food-business operators could use a statement on the labels informing consumers that, from a certain date, no fruit juices contain added sugars.\nFor products manufactured from 2 or more fruits, except where lemon and/or lime juice are used, the product name must be composed of a list of the fruits used, in descending order of the volume of the fruit juices or purées included, as indicated in the list of ingredients.\nIn the case of products manufactured from 3 or more fruits, the indication of the fruits used may be replaced by the words ‘several fruits’ or a similar wording, or by the number of fruits used.\nIn the case of concentrated fruit juice, if the product is not intended for delivery to the final consumer, the labelling must indicate the presence and quantity of added lemon juice, lime juice or acidifying agents on the packaging, on a label attached to the packaging, or on an accompanying document.\nThe directive lists the raw materials which may be used to manufacture juice and nectar, and also the additives which may be authorised, subject to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the labelling for foodstuffs.\nThe minimum content of fruit juice and/or fruit purée in fruit nectar must conform to the levels indicated in the directive and must be stated in the product labelling.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 12 January 2002 and had to become law in the EU countries by 11 July 2003.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFood information to consumers — legislation (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2001/112/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption (OJ L 10, 12.1.2002, pp. 58-66)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2001/112/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
