{"celex_id": "32021R0023", "reference": "22.1.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 22/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2021/23 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 December 2020\non a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties and amending Regulations (EU) No 1095/2010, (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 600/2014, (EU) No 806/2014 and (EU) 2015/2365 and Directives 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2014/59/EU and (EU) 2017/1132\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nFinancial markets are pivotal for the functioning of modern economies. The more integrated they are, the greater the potential for efficient allocation of economic resources will be, potentially benefitting economic performance. However, in order to improve the functioning of the single market in financial services, it is important to have procedures in place to deal with effects of market turmoil and to ensure that if a financial institution or a financial market infrastructure that is active in this market faces financial distress or is at the point of failure, such an event does not de-stabilise the entire financial market and damage growth across the wider economy.\n(2)\nCentral counterparties (CCPs) are key components of global financial markets, stepping in between participants to act as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer, and playing a central role in processing financial transactions and managing exposures to diverse risks inherent in those transactions. CCPs centralise the handling of transactions and positions of counterparties, honour the obligations created by the transactions, and require adequate collateral from their members as margin and as contributions to default funds.\n(3)\nThe integration of Union financial markets has resulted in CCPs evolving from primarily serving domestic needs and markets to constituting critical nodes in Union financial markets more widely. CCPs authorised in the Union today clear several product classes, including listed and over-the-counter (OTC) financial and commodity derivatives, cash equities, bonds and other products such as repos. They provide services across national borders to a broad range of financial and other institutions across the Union. While some CCPs remain focused on domestic markets, they are all systemically important at least in their home markets.\n(4)\nAs a significant amount of the financial risk of the Union financial system is processed by and concentrated in CCPs on behalf of clearing members and their clients, effective regulation and robust supervision of CCPs are essential. Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) requires CCPs authorised in the Union to observe high prudential, organisational and conduct of business standards. Competent authorities, working together within supervisory colleges which group together relevant authorities for the specific tasks allocated to them, are tasked with the full oversight of the activities of CCPs. In accordance with commitments entered into by G20 leaders since the 2008 financial crisis, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 also requires standardised OTC derivatives to be centrally cleared by a CCP. As the obligation to centrally clear OTC derivatives comes into effect, the volume and range of business done by CCPs is likely to increase which could, in turn, provide additional challenges for risk management strategies of CCPs.\n(5)\nRegulation (EU) No 648/2012 has contributed to the increased resilience of CCPs and of wider financial markets against the broad range of risks processed and concentrated in CCPs. However, no system of rules and practices can prevent existing resources from being inadequate in managing the risks incurred by a CCP, including one or more defaults by clearing members. Faced with a scenario of severe financial distress or impending failure, financial institutions should in principle remain subject to normal insolvency proceedings. However, as the 2008 financial crisis has shown, in particular during a period of prolonged economic instability and uncertainty, such proceedings can disrupt functions critical to the economy, jeopardising financial stability. Normal corporate insolvency procedures may not always ensure sufficient speed of intervention or adequately prioritise the continuity of the critical functions of financial institutions for the sake of preserving financial stability. In order to prevent such negative consequences of normal insolvency proceedings, it is necessary to create a special resolution framework for CCPs.\n(6)\nThe 2008 financial crisis highlighted the lack of adequate tools to preserve the critical functions provided by failing financial institutions. It further demonstrated the absence of frameworks to enable cooperation and coordination amongst authorities, in particular those located in different Member States or jurisdictions, to ensure the taking of swift and decisive action. Without such tools and in the absence of cooperation and coordination frameworks, Member States were compelled to rescue financial institutions using taxpayer money in order to stem contagion and reduce panic. While CCPs were not direct recipients of extraordinary public financial support in the 2008 financial crisis, they were protected from the effects that banks failing to perform their obligations would otherwise have had on them. A recovery and resolution framework for CCPs complements the bank resolution framework adopted under Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), and is therefore necessary to prevent reliance on taxpayer money in the event of their disorderly failure. Such a framework should also address the possibility of CCPs entering into resolution for reasons other than the default of one or several of their clearing members.\n(7)\nThe objective of a credible recovery and resolution framework is to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that CCPs set out measures to recover from financial distress, to maintain the critical functions of a CCP which is failing or likely to fail while winding up the remaining activities through normal insolvency proceedings, and to preserve financial stability and to avoid a significant adverse effect on the financial system and its ability to serve the real economy while minimising the cost to taxpayers of a CCP failure. A recovery and resolution framework further bolsters the preparedness of CCPs and authorities to mitigate financial distress and provide authorities with further insight into CCPs’ preparations for stress scenarios. It also provides authorities with powers to prepare for the potential resolution of a CCP and deal with the declining health of a CCP in a coordinated manner, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of financial markets.\n(8)\nCurrently, there are no harmonised provisions for the recovery and resolution of CCPs across the Union. Some Member States have already enacted legislative changes that require CCPs to draw up recovery plans and that introduce mechanisms to resolve failing CCPs. Furthermore, there are considerable substantive and procedural differences between Member States on the laws, regulations and administrative provisions which govern the insolvency of CCPs. The absence of common conditions, powers and processes for the recovery and resolution of CCPs is likely to constitute a barrier to the smooth functioning of the internal market and hinder cooperation between national authorities when dealing with the failure of a CCP and applying appropriate loss allocation mechanisms on its clearing members, both in the Union and globally. This is particularly true where different approaches mean that national authorities do not have the same level of control or the same ability to resolve CCPs. Those differences in recovery and resolution regimes might affect CCPs, clearing members and the clients of clearing members differently across Member States, potentially creating competitive distortions across the internal market. The absence of common rules and tools for how financial distress or failure in a CCP should be handled can affect clearing members’ and their clients’ choice to clear and CCPs’ choice of their place of establishment, thereby preventing CCPs from fully benefiting from their fundamental freedoms within the internal market. In turn, this could discourage clearing members and their clients from accessing CCPs across borders in the internal market and hinder further integration in the Union’s capital markets. Common recovery and resolution rules in all Member States are therefore necessary to ensure that CCPs are not limited in exercising their internal market freedoms by the financial capacity of Member States and their authorities to manage their failure.\n(9)\nThe review of the regulatory framework applicable to banks and to other financial institutions which has taken place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and in particular the strengthening of banks’ capital and liquidity buffers, better tools for macro-prudential policies and comprehensive rules on the recovery and resolution of banks, have reduced the likelihood of future crises and enhanced the resilience of all financial institutions and market infrastructures, including CCPs, to economic stress, whether caused by systemic disturbances or by events specific to individual institutions. Since 1 January 2015, a recovery and resolution regime for banks has applied in Member States pursuant to Directive 2014/59/EU.\n(10)\nBuilding on the approach for bank recovery and resolution, competent authorities and resolution authorities should be prepared and have adequate tools at their disposal to handle situations involving CCP failures. However, due to their different functions and business models, the risks inherent in banks and CCPs are different. Specific tools and powers are therefore needed for CCP failure scenarios caused by the failure of the CCP’s clearing members or as a result of non-default events.\n(11)\nA regulation is the proper legal act to choose in order to complement and build on the approach established by Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, which provides for uniform prudential requirements applicable to CCPs. Setting recovery and resolution requirements in a directive could create inconsistencies by the adoption of potentially different national rules in respect of an area otherwise governed by directly applicable Union law and increasingly characterised by the cross-border provision of CCPs’ services. Therefore uniform and directly applicable rules on recovery and resolution of CCPs should also be adopted.\n(12)\nIn order to ensure consistency with existing Union legislation in the area of financial services, as well as the greatest possible level of financial stability across the Union, the recovery and resolution regime laid down in this Regulation should apply to CCPs that are subject to the prudential requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, regardless of whether they have a banking licence. While there might be differences in the risk profile associated with alternative corporate structures, CCPs are stand-alone entities that are required to fulfil all requirements under this Regulation and under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 independently from their parent undertaking or other group entities. The group of which a CCP forms part does not therefore need to be subject to this Regulation. The group dimension, including, inter alia, the operational, personal and financial relations of a CCP with group entities, should, however, be taken into account in the CCP’s recovery and resolution planning insofar it could affect the recovery or resolution of the CCP or insofar recovery and resolution actions could have an impact on other entities of the group.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure that resolution actions are taken efficiently and effectively, and in line with resolution objectives, Member States should appoint, as resolution authorities for the purpose of this Regulation, national central banks, competent ministries, public administrative authorities or authorities entrusted with public administrative powers to perform functions and tasks in relation to resolution, including any existing resolution authorities. Member States should also ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to those resolution authorities. In Member States where a CCP is established, adequate structural arrangements should be put in place to separate the CCP resolution functions from other functions, in particular where the authority responsible for the prudential supervision of the CCP, or prudential supervision of credit institutions or investment firms that are clearing members of the CCP, is designated as the resolution authority, to avoid any conflicts of interest and risk of regulatory forbearance. In such cases, the independence of the resolution authority’s decision-making process should be ensured, while not preventing decision-making from converging at the highest level.\n(14)\nIn light of the consequences that the failure of a CCP and the subsequent actions might have on the financial system and the economy of a Member State, as well as the possible ultimate need to use public funds to resolve a crisis, the Ministries of Finance or other relevant ministries in Member States should be able to decide, in line with national democratic procedures, on the use of public funds as a last resort and should consequently be closely involved, at an early stage, in the process of recovery and resolution. Therefore, with regard to the use of public funds as a last resort, this Regulation should be without prejudice to the distribution of competences between the relevant ministries or the government and the resolution authority as provided for in the legal systems of Member States.\n(15)\nAs CCPs often provide services across the Union, effective recovery and resolution requires cooperation among competent authorities and resolution authorities within supervisory and resolution colleges, notably at the preparatory stages of recovery and resolution. That includes assessing the recovery plan developed by the CCP, contributing to and reaching a joint decision on resolution plans drawn up by the resolution authority of the CCP, and addressing any impediments to resolvability of the CCP.\n(16)\nThe resolution of CCPs should strike the balance between the need, on the one hand, for procedures that take into account the urgency of the situation and allow for efficient, fair and timely solutions and, on the other, the necessity to protect financial stability in the Member States where the CCP provides services. The authorities whose areas of competence would be affected by the failure of a CCP should share their views in the resolution college to achieve those objectives. This should include in particular sharing information on the preparation of clearing members and, where relevant, clients with regard to potential default management, recovery and resolution measures and the supervisory treatment of the related exposures towards the CCP. The authorities of Member States whose financial stability could be impacted by the failure of the CCP should be able to participate in the resolution college based on their assessment of the impact that the CCP’s resolution could have on financial stability in their respective Member State. Member States should have the possibility to be represented in the resolution college by the competent authorities and resolution authorities of clearing members. Member States which are not represented by clearing members’ authorities should be able to participate by choosing between participation in the college of the competent authority of clearing members’ clients and of the resolution authority of clearing members’ clients. The authorities should provide appropriate justification for their participation, based on their analysis of the negative impact that the CCP’s resolution could have on their Member States, to the resolution authority of the CCP. Similarly, in order to ensure a regular exchange of views and coordination with relevant third-country authorities, these should be invited to participate in resolution colleges as observers where necessary.\n(17)\nIn order to address the potential failure of a CCP in an effective and proportionate manner, authorities should take into account a number of factors when exercising their recovery and resolution powers such as the nature of the CCP’s business, ownership structure, legal and organisational structure, risk profile, size, legal status, substitutability and interconnectedness to the financial system. The authorities should also take account of whether its failure and subsequent winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would be likely to have a significant negative effect on financial markets, on other financial institutions, or on the wider economy.\n(18)\nIn order to deal in an efficient manner with failing CCPs, competent authorities should have the power to impose preparatory measures on CCPs. A minimum standard should be established as regards the contents and information to be included in recovery plans to ensure that all CCPs in the Union have sufficiently detailed recovery plans should they face financial distress. Such recovery plan should contemplate an appropriate range of scenarios, envisaging both systemic and specific stresses to the CCP, that would endanger its viability, also taking into account the potential impact of contagion in a crisis, both domestic and cross-border. The scenarios should be more severe than those used for the purposes of regular stress testing pursuant to Article 49 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, while remaining plausible. The recovery plan should cover a broad range of scenarios including scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both; and should include comprehensive arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book, for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default, and adequate absorbency for all other types of losses. Recovery plans should distinguish between different types of non-default events. The recovery plan should form part of the operating rules of the CCP agreed contractually with clearing members. Those operating rules should further contain provisions to ensure the enforceability of recovery measures outlined in the recovery plan in all scenarios. Recovery plans should not assume access to extraordinary public financial support or expose taxpayers to the risk of loss.\n(19)\nCCPs should be required to draw up and regularly review and update their recovery plans. The recovery phase in that context should start when there is a significant deterioration in the CCP’s financial situation or risk of breach of its capital and prudential requirements under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 that could lead to the infringement of its authorisation requirements that would justify the withdrawal of its authorisation pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. This should be indicated with reference to a framework of qualitative or quantitative indicators included in the recovery plan.\n(20)\nIn order to create sound incentives ex-ante and to ensure a fair allocation of losses, recovery plans should ensure that the application of recovery tools appropriately balances the allocation of losses between CCPs, clearing members and, where applicable, their clients. As a general principle, losses in recovery should be distributed between CCPs, clearing members, and, where applicable, their clients as a function of their responsibility for the risk transferred to the CCP and their ability to control and manage such risks. Recovery plans should ensure that the CCP’s capital is exposed to losses caused by both default and non-default events, before losses are allocated to clearing members. As an incentive for proper risk management and to further reduce the risks of losses for the taxpayer, the CCP should use a portion of its pre-funded dedicated own resources as referred to in Article 43 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, which can include any capital it holds in addition to its minimum capital requirements, to comply with the notification threshold referred to in the delegated act adopted on the basis of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, as a recovery measure before resorting to other recovery measures requiring financial contributions from clearing members.\nThat additional amount of pre-funded dedicated own resources, which is distinct from the pre-funded own resources referred to in Article 45(4) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, should not be lower than 10 % nor higher than 25 % of the risk based capital requirements calculated in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 irrespective of whether those requirements are lower or higher than the initial capital referred to in Article 16(1) of that Regulation.\n(21)\nThe CCP should submit its recovery plan to the competent authority which should without undue delay transmit the plan to the supervisory college, established under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, for a complete assessment, to be carried out by joint decision of the college. The assessment should include whether the plan is comprehensive and whether it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP, in a timely manner, including in periods of severe financial distress.\n(22)\nRecovery plans should comprehensively set out the actions that the CCP would take to address any unmatched outstanding obligations, uncovered loss, liquidity shortfall, or capital inadequacy, as well as the actions to replenish any depleted pre-funded financial resources and liquidity arrangements in order to restore the CCP’s viability and its continuing ability to meet its requirements for authorisation. Neither the power of the resolution authority to apply a resolution cash call nor the requirement to have a minimum contractual commitment for the recovery cash call should affect the right of the CCP to introduce recovery cash calls in its rules above the minimum obligatory contractual commitment specified in this Regulation or the risk management of the CCP.\n(23)\nRecovery plans should also consider cyber-attacks which could lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the CCP or to a risk of breaching prudential requirements under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n(24)\nCCPs should ensure that their recovery plan is non-discriminatory and balanced in terms of its impact and the incentives it creates. The effects of the recovery measures on clearing members and, where the relevant information is available, their clients and on the financial system of the Union or of one or more of its Member States more broadly should be proportionate. In particular, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 CCPs have to ensure that their clearing members have limited exposures toward the CCP. CCPs should ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the drawing-up of the recovery plan through their involvement in the CCP’s risk committee, as the case might be, and by being appropriately consulted. Since opinions can be expected to differ among stakeholders, CCPs should establish clear processes to manage the diversity of stakeholders’ views as well as any conflict of interest between those stakeholders and the CCP.\n(25)\nIn view of the global nature of the markets served by CCPs, the CCP’s operating rules should include contractual provisions to ensure its ability to apply the recovery options, where necessary, to contracts or assets governed by the law of a third country or to entities based in third countries.\n(26)\nWhere a CCP does not present an adequate recovery plan, competent authorities should be able to require the CCP to take the measures necessary to redress the material deficiencies of the plan in order to strengthen the business of the CCP and ensure that the CCP could allocate losses, restore its capital and, where relevant, re-match its book in the event of failure. That power should allow competent authorities to take preventive action to the extent that it is necessary to address any deficiencies and, therefore, to meet the objectives of financial stability.\n(27)\nIn the exceptional cases of variation margin gains haircutting following a non-default event and if recovery is successful, the competent authority should be able to require the CCP to recompense its clearing members proportionately to their loss in excess of their contractual commitments, through cash payments or, where appropriate, to require the CCP to issue instruments recognising a claim on the future profits of the CCP.\n(28)\nResolution planning is an essential component of effective resolution. The plans should be drawn up by the resolution authority of the CCP and jointly agreed in the resolution college. The plans should cover a broad range of scenarios, distinguishing scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both, as well as different types of non-default events. Authorities should have all the information necessary to identify and ensure the continuity of critical functions. The content of a resolution plan should, however, be appropriate to the activities of the CCP and the types of products it clears and it should be based, inter alia, on the information provided by it. In order to facilitate the enforcement of resolution cash calls and of the reduction of the amount of any gains payable to a non-defaulting clearing member of a CCP under resolution, a reference to the power of the resolution authority to require such resolution cash calls and such reduction should be included in the operating rules of the CCP. Where needed, the operating rules of the CCP that are agreed contractually with clearing members should contain provisions to ensure the enforceability of other resolution measures by resolution authorities.\n(29)\nResolution authorities, on the basis of the assessment of resolvability, should have the power to require changes to the legal or operational structure and organisation of CCPs directly or indirectly through the competent authority, to take measures which are necessary and proportionate to reduce or remove material impediments to the application of resolution tools and ensure their resolvability. Taking into account the diverse structure of the groups that CCPs belong to, the differences in structures compared to banking groups, and the different regulatory frameworks that apply to individual entities within such groups, the resolution authority of the CCP, in consultation with the competent authority of the CCP, should be able to assess whether enforcing changes to the legal or operational structures of the CCP, or any group entity directly or indirectly under its control, involves changes in the structures of the group that the CCP belongs to that could lead to issues of legal challenge or issues of enforceability, depending on the specific legal circumstances that apply. The resolution authority, when assessing how to remove such impediments to resolution, should be able to suggest a different set of resolvability measures than requiring changes to the legal or operational structures of the group, if the use of such alternative measures would remove the impediments to resolvability in an equivalent way.\n(30)\nAs regards resolution plans and resolvability assessments day-to-day supervisory considerations are outweighed by the need to expedite and ensure swift restructuring actions in order to secure a CCP’s critical functions and safeguard financial stability. In the event of disagreement between the different members of the resolution college on decisions to be taken with regard to the CCP’s resolution plan, the assessment of the CCP’s resolvability and the decision to remove any impediments thereto, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA) should play a mediation role in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). Such binding mediation by ESMA should nonetheless be prepared for consideration by an ESMA internal committee, in view of the competences of ESMA members to ensure financial stability and to oversee clearing members in several Member States. Certain competent authorities under the Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) should be invited to participate as observers to that ESMA internal committee in view of the fact that such authorities carry out similar tasks under Directive 2014/59/EU. Such binding mediation should not prevent non-binding mediation in accordance with Article 31 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 in other cases. In accordance with Article 38 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, such binding mediation may not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of Member States.\n(31)\nIt could be necessary for the recovery plan of the CCP to set out the conditions under which the provision of possible contractually binding financial support agreements, guarantees or other forms of operational support from a parent undertaking or another group entity to a CCP within the same group would be triggered. Transparency regarding such arrangements would mitigate risks to the liquidity and solvency of the group entity providing support to a CCP facing financial distress. Therefore, any change to such arrangements affecting the quality and nature of such group support should be considered a material change for the purpose of reviewing the recovery plan.\n(32)\nGiven the sensitivity of the information contained in the recovery and resolution plans, those plans should be subject to appropriate confidentiality provisions.\n(33)\nCompetent authorities should transmit the recovery plans and any changes thereto to the relevant resolution authorities, and the latter should transmit the resolution plans and any changes thereto to competent authorities, thus permanently keeping every relevant authority fully informed.\n(34)\nIn order to preserve financial stability, it is necessary that competent authorities are able to remedy the deterioration of a CCP’s financial and economic situation before that CCP reaches a point at which authorities have no other alternative but to resolve it or to direct the CCP to change its recovery measures where they could be detrimental for overall financial stability. Competent authorities should therefore be granted early intervention powers to avoid or minimise adverse effects on financial stability or on the interests of clients that could result from the CCP’s implementation of certain measures. Early intervention powers should be conferred on competent authorities in addition to their powers provided for in the national law of Member States or under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for circumstances other than those considered to be early intervention. Early intervention powers should include the power to restrict or prohibit any remuneration of equity and instruments treated as equity, including dividend payments and buybacks by the CCP, to the fullest extent possible without triggering an event of default, and also the power to restrict, prohibit or freeze any payments of variable remuneration as defined by the CCP’s remuneration policy pursuant to Article 26(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, discretionary pension benefits or severance packages to senior management.\n(35)\nIn the framework of early intervention powers, and in accordance with the relevant provisions under national law, the competent authority should be able to appoint a temporary administrator, either to replace or to temporarily work with the board and senior management of the CCP. The task of the temporary administrator should be to exercise any powers conferred on it, subject to any condition imposed on it upon its appointment, with a view to promoting solutions to redress the financial situation of the CCP. The appointment of the temporary administrator should not unduly interfere with the rights of the shareholders or owners or with procedural obligations established under Union or national company law and should respect international obligations of the Union and Member States, relating to investment protection.\n(36)\nDuring the recovery and early intervention phases, shareholders should retain their rights in full. They should lose such rights once the CCP has been put under resolution. Any remuneration of equity and instruments treated as equity, including dividend payments and buybacks by the CCP, should be restricted or prohibited in recovery, to the fullest extent possible without triggering an event of default. Equity holders of a CCP should absorb losses first in resolution in a way that minimises the risk of legal challenge by them where such losses are greater than the losses that they would have incurred under normal insolvency proceedings also known as the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle. A resolution authority should be able to deviate from the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle. However, a shareholder or a creditor incurring greater loss than it would have incurred under normal insolvency proceedings would be entitled to the payment of the difference.\n(37)\nThe resolution framework should provide for timely entry into resolution before a CCP is insolvent. A CCP should be considered to be failing or likely to fail when it infringes or is likely in the near future to infringe the requirements for continuing authorisation, when its recovery has failed or is likely to fail to restore its viability, when the CCP is unable or is likely to be unable to provide a critical function, when the assets of the CCP are or are likely in the near future to be less than its liabilities, when the CCP is or is likely in the near future to be unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due, or when the CCP requires extraordinary public financial support. However, the fact that a CCP does not comply with all the requirements for authorisation should not justify by itself the entry into resolution.\n(38)\nThe provision of emergency liquidity assistance from a central bank, where such a facility is available, should not be a condition that demonstrates that a CCP is or will be, in the near future, unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due. In order to preserve financial stability, in particular in the case of a systemic liquidity shortage, State guarantees on liquidity facilities provided by central banks or State guarantees of newly issued liabilities to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State should not trigger entry into resolution, provided that a number of conditions are met.\n(39)\nMembers of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), other Member States’ bodies performing similar functions, other Union public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt, and the Bank for International Settlements as well as other entities listed in Article 1(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 can act in the capacity of a clearing member in connection with their operations. Loss allocation tools envisaged in the recovery plan of CCPs should not apply to those entities. Similarly, resolution authorities should not apply loss allocation tools with regard to those entities, in order to avoid the exposure of public money.\n(40)\nWhere a CCP meets the conditions for resolution, the resolution authority of the CCP should have at its disposal a harmonised set of resolution tools and powers. They should enable the resolution authority to address scenarios caused both by default and non-default events, or a combination of both. Their exercise should be subject to common conditions, objectives, and general principles. In particular, the application of such tools or powers should not impinge on the effective resolution of cross-border groups.\n(41)\nThe prime objectives of resolution should be to ensure the continuity of critical functions, to avoid adverse effects on financial stability, and to protect public funds.\n(42)\nThe critical functions of a failing CCP should be maintained, although re-structured with changes to the management where appropriate, through the application of resolution tools and, to the largest extent possible, with the use of private funds and without reliance on extraordinary public financial support. That objective could be achieved by allocating outstanding losses and restoring the CCP to a matched book through application of the position and loss allocation tools in the case of default losses, or, in the case of non-default losses, through the write-down of equity instruments and the write-down and conversion to equity of unsecured liabilities to absorb losses and recapitalise the CCP. To prevent the need for the application of government stabilisation tools, the resolution authority should also be able to use the resolution cash call following a non-default event. A CCP or specific clearing service should also be able to be sold to or merged with a solvent third-party CCP that is able to conduct and manage the transferred clearing activities. In line with the objective of maintaining the critical functions of the CCP and prior to taking the actions described above, the resolution authority should generally enforce any existing and outstanding contractual obligations towards the CCP in line with how they would be called in its operating rules, including in particular any contractual obligations by clearing members to meet recovery cash calls or to take on positions of defaulting clearing members, whether through an auction or other agreed means in the CCP’s operating rules, as well as any existing and outstanding contractual obligations committing parties other than clearing members to any forms of financial support.\n(43)\nRapid and decisive action is necessary to sustain market confidence and minimise contagion. Once the conditions for resolution have been met, the resolution authority of the CCP should not delay in taking appropriate and coordinated resolution action in the public interest. The failure of a CCP can occur in circumstances that require an immediate reaction by the relevant resolution authority. That authority should therefore be allowed to take resolution actions notwithstanding the exercise of recovery measures by the CCP or without imposing an obligation to first use the early intervention powers.\n(44)\nWhen taking resolution actions, the resolution authority of the CCP should take into account and follow the measures provided for in the resolution plans drawn up within the resolution college, unless the resolution authority considers, taking into account the circumstances of the case, that the resolution objectives will be achieved more effectively by taking actions which are not provided for in the resolution plans. The resolution authority should take into account the general principles of decision-making, including the need to balance the interests of different stakeholders of the CCP and to ensure transparency towards and involvement of the relevant authorities of Member States where the proposed decision or action could have implications on the financial stability or fiscal resources. In particular, the resolution authority should inform the resolution college of the planned resolution actions, including where such actions deviate from the resolution plan.\n(45)\nInterference with property rights should be proportionate to the financial stability risk. Resolution tools should therefore be applied only with respect to those CCPs that meet the conditions for resolution, specifically where it is necessary to pursue the objective of financial stability in the public interest. Resolution tools and powers could disrupt the rights of shareholders, creditors, clearing members and, where applicable, clients of clearing members. Resolution action should therefore be taken only where necessary in the public interest and any interference with those rights should be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’).\n(46)\nAffected shareholders, clearing members and other creditors of the CCP should not incur losses greater than those which they would have incurred if the resolution authority had not taken resolution action in relation to the CCP and they had instead been subject to all applicable outstanding obligations pursuant to the CCP’s default rules or other contractual arrangements in its operating rules, and the CCP had been wound up in normal insolvency proceedings (‘no creditor worse off’ principle). In the event of a partial transfer of assets of a CCP under resolution to a private purchaser or to a bridge CCP, the residual part of the CCP under resolution should be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.\n(47)\nFor the purpose of protecting the rights of shareholders, of clearing members and of other creditors, clear rules should be laid down concerning the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the CCP and the valuation of the treatment that shareholders, clearing members and other creditors would have received if the resolution authority had not taken resolution action. This should compare the treatment that shareholders, clearing members and other creditors have actually been afforded in resolution and the treatment they would have received if the resolution authority had not taken resolution action in relation to the CCP and if they had instead been subject to possible outstanding obligations pursuant to the CCP’s recovery plan or other arrangements in its operating rules and the CCP had been wound up in normal insolvency proceedings. The use of the resolution cash call, which should be included in the CCP’s operating rules, is reserved for the resolution authority. It cannot be used by the CCP, or an administrator or liquidator in insolvency and it should therefore not be part of the treatment that shareholders, clearing members and other creditors would have received if the resolution authority had not taken resolution action. Any use of the power to reduce the amount of any gains payable to a non-defaulting clearing member by the resolution authority that exceeds contractually agreed limits for such a reduction should also not be part of the treatment that shareholders, clearing members and other creditors would have received if the resolution authority had not taken resolution action.\nWhere shareholders, clearing members and other creditors have received, in payment of, or compensation for, their claims, less than the amount that they would have received if the resolution authority had not taken resolution action in relation to the CCP and they had instead been subject to possible outstanding obligations pursuant to the CCP’s default rules or other contractual arrangements in its operating rules and the CCP had been wound up in normal insolvency proceedings, they should be entitled to the payment of the difference. Clients should only be included in that comparison and should only be entitled to the payment of any difference in treatment when there is a contractual basis for a direct claim from clients against the CCP, making them creditors of the CCP. Only in such cases can the resolution authority control the direct impact of its actions. It should be possible to challenge that comparison separately from the resolution decision. Member States should be free to decide on the procedure as to how to pay any difference of treatment that has been determined to shareholders, clearing members and other creditors.\n(48)\nRecovery and resolution actions can indirectly affect clients and indirect clients that are not creditors of the CCP, to the extent that costs of recovery and resolution have been passed to those clients and indirect clients under the applicable contractual arrangements. Therefore, the impact of a CCP recovery and resolution scenario on clients and indirect clients should also be addressed through the same contractual arrangements with the clearing members and clients that provide them with clearing services. This can be achieved by ensuring that, if contractual arrangements allow clearing members to pass on to their clients the negative consequences of the resolution tools, those contractual arrangements also include, on an equivalent and proportionate basis, the right of clients to any compensation clearing members receive from the CCP or any cash equivalent of such compensation or any proceeds they receive following a ‘no creditor worse off’ claim, to the extent that these relate to client positions. Such provisions should also apply to the contractual arrangements by clients and indirect clients offering indirect clearing services to their clients.\n(49)\nTo ensure the effective resolution of a CCP, the valuation process should determine as accurately as possible any losses that need to be allocated for the CCP to re-establish a matched book of outstanding positions and to meet ongoing payment obligations. The valuation of assets and liabilities of a failing CCP should be based on fair, prudent and realistic assumptions at the moment when the resolution tools are applied. The value of liabilities should not, however, be affected in the valuation by the financial state of the CCP. It should be possible, for reasons of urgency, for resolution authorities to make a rapid valuation of the assets or the liabilities of a failing CCP. That valuation should be provisional and should apply until an independent valuation is carried out.\n(50)\nUpon entry into resolution of the CCP, the resolution authority should enforce any outstanding contractual obligations set out in the operating rules of the CCP, including outstanding recovery measures, except where the exercise of another resolution power or tool is more appropriate to mitigate adverse effects for financial stability or to secure the critical functions of the CCP in a timely manner. The resolution authority should have the right, but not the obligation, to enforce those contractual obligations still after resolution if the reasons for refraining from their enforcement no longer exist. In order to allow for the clearing members and other relevant parties to prepare for the enforcement of the remaining obligations, the resolution authority should notify the relevant clearing members and other parties in advance. That pre-notification period should be from three to six months.\nThe resolution authority should determine, in consultation with the competent authorities and resolution authorities of the affected clearing members and any other parties committed by existing and outstanding obligations, whether the reasons for refraining from enforcing the contractual obligations have ceased to exist and whether to enforce the remaining obligations. If the reasons continue to exist, the resolution authority should refrain from enforcing those obligations. The proceeds from the delayed enforcement of the outstanding contractual obligations should be used to recover any public funds used for the payment of ‘no creditor worse off’ claims resulting from the resolutions authority’s decision to refrain from enforcing those obligations or the application of any government stabilisation tool. The resolution authority should use this power of delayed enforcement only to the extent that the ‘no creditor worse off’ safeguard is not breached with respect to the stakeholder that will be subject to the delayed enforcement. In the case of default losses, the resolution authority should restore the CCP to a matched book and allocate outstanding losses through application of position and loss allocation tools. In the case of non-default losses, losses should be absorbed by regulatory capital instruments and should be allocated to shareholders up to their capacity either through the cancellation or transfer of instruments of ownership or through severe dilution. Where those instruments are not sufficient, resolution authorities should have the power to write-down unsecured debt and liabilities, in accordance with their ranking under applicable national insolvency law, and apply loss allocation tools, to the extent necessary without jeopardising broader financial stability.\n(51)\nIf, after losses have been absorbed and, where applicable, the CCP has been restored to a matched book and the pre-funded resources of the CCP remain depleted, the resolution authority should ensure that those resources are restored to the levels necessary to meet regulatory requirements, either through the continued exercise of the tools in the CCP’s operating rules or through other actions. In particular, resolution authorities should have the possibility to compensate non-defaulting clearing members that would have been entitled to a ‘no creditor worse off’ compensation payment for the application of loss allocation tools that would result in losses in excess of those that the clearing members would have borne under their obligations under the CCP’s operating rules with instruments of ownership, debt instruments or instruments recognising a claim on the CCP’s future profits. When assessing the amount and the form of compensation, the resolution authority can consider, for example, the financial soundness of the CCP, and the quality of instruments available for compensation and for meeting the ‘no creditor worse off’ safeguard. To maintain an adequate incentive structure, such compensation should reflect the extent to which a clearing member has supported the recovery of the CCP and therefore also take into account the remaining outstanding contractual obligations of the clearing members towards that CCP. Such compensation should be deducted from any entitlement to a ‘no creditor worse off’ payment.\n(52)\nResolution authorities should also ensure that the costs of the resolution of the CCP are minimised and that creditors of the same class are treated in an equitable manner. The resolution authority should be able to take a resolution action which deviates from the principle of equal treatment of creditors if it is justified in the public interest to achieve the resolution objectives and is proportionate to the risk addressed. If the resolution authority uses such measure it should not discriminate anybody on the basis of nationality.\n(53)\nThe resolution of a CCP should not entail calling on extraordinary public financial support. The outstanding recovery tools and resolution tools, in particular the write-down tool, should be applied to the fullest extent possible before or together with any public sector injection of capital or equivalent extraordinary public financial support is given to a CCP. The use of extraordinary public financial support to assist in the resolution of failing institutions is to be a last resort, be limited in time and comply with the relevant State aid provisions.\n(54)\nAn effective resolution regime should minimise the costs of the resolution of a failing CCP borne by the taxpayers. It should ensure that CCPs can be resolved without jeopardising financial stability. The write-down tool and the loss and position allocation tools should achieve that objective by ensuring that shareholders and counterparties who are among the creditors of the failing CCP suffer appropriate losses and bear an appropriate part of the costs arising from the failure of the CCP. The write-down and the loss and position allocation tools therefore give shareholders and counterparties of CCPs a stronger incentive to monitor the health of a CCP during normal circumstances in accordance with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) provided for in its document ‘Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions’.\n(55)\nIn order to ensure that resolution authorities have the necessary flexibility to allocate losses and positions to counterparties in a range of circumstances, it is appropriate that those authorities should be able to apply the position and loss allocation tools both where the objective is to maintain critical clearing services within the CCP under resolution and in conjunction with the transfer of critical services to a bridge CCP or a third party after which the residual part of the CCP ceases to operate and is wound up.\n(56)\nWhere the position and loss allocation tools are applied with the objective of restoring the viability of the failing CCP to enable it to continue to operate as a going concern, the resolution should be accompanied by replacement of management, except where retention of management is appropriate and necessary for the achievement of the resolution objectives, and a subsequent restructuring of the CCP and its activities in a way that addresses the reasons for its failure. That restructuring should be achieved through the implementation of a business reorganisation plan, which should be compatible with the restructuring plan that the CCP might be required to submit pursuant to the State aid framework.\n(57)\nThe position and loss allocation tools should be exercised with a view to re-matching the CCP’s book, stemming any further losses and obtaining additional resources to help recapitalise the CCP and replenish its pre-funded resources. In order to ensure that they are effective and achieve their objective, they should be able to apply to as wide a range of contracts giving rise to unsecured liabilities or creating an unmatched book for the failing CCP as possible. They should provide for the possibility to auction defaulters’ positions among remaining clearing members or to forcibly allocate them to the extent that voluntary arrangements established as part of recovery plan are not exhausted upon entry into resolution, to partially or fully terminate the contracts of defaulted clearing members, of an affected clearing service or asset class and other contracts of the CCP, to further haircut outgoing variation margin payments to such members and, where applicable, their clients, to exercise any outstanding recovery cash calls set out in recovery plans, and to exercise additional resolution cash calls and write-down of capital and debt instruments issued by the CCP or other unsecured liabilities and a conversion of any debt instruments into shares. This includes the possibility to apply the loss allocation tools to contribute to the restoration of a matched book by providing the CCP with funds to accept an auction bid, enabling the CCP to allocate the defaulter’s positions or to make payments on the terminated contracts.\n(58)\nWhen applying the loss allocation tool that allows the reduction of the value of any gains payable by the CCP to non-defaulting clearing members, the resolution authority should rely on processing of variation margin in accordance with the CCP’s account structure, the operation of the reduction of the value of any gains payable by the CCP to non-defaulting clearing members in recovery, if applicable, and the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle.\n(59)\nWith due respect for the impact on financial stability and as a last resort, resolution authorities should be able to exclude or partially exclude some contracts from position and loss allocation in a number of circumstances. Where such exclusions are applied, it should be possible to increase the level of exposure or loss applied to other contracts to take account of such exclusions subject to the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle being respected.\n(60)\nWhere the resolution tools have been applied to transfer the critical functions or viable business of a CCP to a sound entity such as a private sector purchaser or bridge CCP, the residual part of the CCP should be liquidated within an appropriate time frame having regard to any need for the failing CCP to provide services or support to enable the purchaser or bridge CCP to carry out the activities or provide the services acquired by virtue of that transfer.\n(61)\nThe sale of business tool should enable authorities to sell the CCP or parts of its business to one or more purchasers without the consent of shareholders. When applying the sale of business tool, authorities should make arrangements for the marketing of that CCP or part of its business in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory process, while aiming to maximise, as far as possible, the sale price.\n(62)\nAny net proceeds from the transfer of assets or liabilities of the CCP under resolution when applying the sale of business tool should benefit the entity left in the winding up proceedings. Any net proceeds from the transfer of instruments of ownership issued by the CCP under resolution when applying the sale of business tool should benefit the shareholders. Any consideration paid by the purchaser should also benefit any non-defaulting clearing members that have suffered losses. Any such net proceeds or benefit should be subject to the full recoupment of any public fund provided in resolution. Proceeds should be calculated net of the costs that have arisen from the failure of the CCP and from the resolution process.\n(63)\nIn order to perform the sale of business in a timely manner and protect financial stability, the assessment of the buyer of a qualifying holding should be carried out in a timely manner that does not delay the application of the sale of business tool. The CCP, the purchaser or both, depending on the effects of the sale of business tool and the form of acquisition, should be able to exercise or maintain existing rights of membership and accessing payment and settlement systems and other linked financial market infrastructures and trading venues. Such rights should not be denied on the basis either of non-compliance with the relevant criteria for membership or participation, or of insufficient credit rating. A purchaser who does not meet those criteria can only exercise such rights for a period to be specified by the resolution authority.\n(64)\nInformation concerning the marketing of a failing CCP and the negotiations with potential acquirers prior to the application of the sale-of-business tool is likely to be of systemic importance. In order to ensure financial stability, it is important that it is possible for the disclosure to the public of such information required under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) to be delayed for the time necessary to plan and structure the resolution of the CCP in accordance with delays permitted under the market abuse regime.\n(65)\nAs a CCP which is wholly or partially owned by one or more public authorities or controlled by the resolution authority, a bridge CCP should have as its main purpose ensuring that essential financial services continue to be provided to the clearing members and clients of the CCP that had been placed under resolution and that essential financial activities continue to be performed. The bridge CCP should be operated as a viable going concern entity and be put back on the market when conditions are appropriate or wound up if it is no longer viable.\n(66)\nWhere all other options are unavailable or demonstrably insufficient to safeguard financial stability, government participation in the shape of equity support or temporary public ownership should be possible, in accordance with applicable rules on State aid, including a restructuring of the operations of the CCP. In order to avoid moral hazard, such extraordinary public financial support should be provided only as a last resort, be temporary in nature and always be recovered over an appropriate period. Therefore, while not constituting an obstacle to applying government stabilisation tools, comprehensive and credible arrangements for the recoupment of funds should be established by Member States. The application of government stabilisation tools is without prejudice to the role of any central bank in potentially providing liquidity to the financial system, at the central bank’s exclusive discretion, even in times of stress.\n(67)\nTo ensure the ability of a resolution authority to apply the loss and position allocation tools to contracts with entities based in third countries, recognition of that possibility should be included in the operating rules of the CCP.\n(68)\nResolution authorities should have all the necessary legal powers that, in different combinations, could be exercised when applying the resolution tools. They should include the power to transfer instruments of ownership, assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of a failing CCP to another entity such as another CCP or a bridge CCP, the power to write down or cancel instruments of ownership, or write down or convert liabilities of a failing CCP, the power to write down variation margin, the power to enforce any outstanding obligations of third parties in relation to the CCP, including recovery cash calls, as set out in the CCP’s operating rules, and position allocations, the power to exercise resolution cash calls, the power to terminate contracts of the CCP partially and fully, the power to replace the management and the power to impose a temporary moratorium on the payment of claims. The CCP and the members of its board and senior management should remain liable, subject to national civil or criminal law, for the failure of the CCP.\n(69)\nThe resolution framework should include procedural requirements to ensure that resolution actions are properly notified and made public. However, as information obtained by resolution authorities and their professional advisers during the resolution process is likely to be sensitive, before the resolution decision is made public, it should be subject to an effective confidentiality regime. The fact that information on the contents and details of recovery and resolution plans and the result of any assessment of those plans could have far-reaching effects, in particular on the undertakings concerned, must be taken into account. Any information provided in respect of a decision before it is taken, be it on whether the conditions for resolution are satisfied, on the application of a specific tool or of any action during the proceedings, must be presumed to have effects on the public and private interests concerned by the action. Information that the resolution authority is examining a specific CCP could be enough for there to be negative effects on that CCP. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms for maintaining the confidentiality of such information, such as the content and details of recovery and resolution plans and the result of any assessment carried out in that context.\n(70)\nResolution authorities should have ancillary powers to ensure the effectiveness of the transfer of instruments of ownership or debt instruments and assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including positions and related margins. Subject to the safeguards specified in this Regulation, those powers should include the power to remove the rights of third parties from the transferred instruments or assets and the power to enforce contracts and to provide for the continuity of arrangements vis-à-vis the recipient of the transferred assets and instruments of ownership. However, the rights of employees to terminate a contract of employment should not be affected. The right of a party to terminate a contract with a CCP under resolution, or a group entity thereof, for reasons other than the resolution of the failing CCP should not be affected either. Resolution authorities should have the ancillary power to require the residual CCP that is being wound up under normal insolvency proceedings to provide services that are necessary to enable the CCP to which assets, contracts or instruments of ownership have been transferred by virtue of the application of the sale of business tool or the bridge CCP tool to operate its business.\n(71)\nGiven that crisis management measures could be required to be taken urgently due to serious financial stability risks in the Member State and the Union, any procedure under national law relating to the application for ex-ante judicial approval of a crisis management measure and the court’s consideration of such an application should be expeditious. Given the requirement for a crisis management measure to be taken urgently, the court should give its decision within 24 hours and Member States should ensure that the relevant authority can take its decision immediately after the court’s decision. This should be without prejudice to the right of interested parties to request the court to set aside the decision for a limited period after the resolution authority has taken the crisis management measure.\n(72)\nIn accordance with Article 47 of the Charter, the parties concerned have the right to due process and to an effective remedy against the measures affecting them. The decisions taken by the resolution authorities should therefore be subject to the right of appeal.\n(73)\nResolution action taken by national resolution authorities might require economic assessments and a large margin of discretion. The national resolution authorities are specifically equipped with the expertise needed for making those assessments and for determining the appropriate use of the margin of discretion. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the economic assessments made by national resolution authorities in that context are used as a basis by national courts when reviewing the crisis management measures concerned. However, the complex nature of those assessments should not prevent national courts from examining whether the evidence relied on by the resolution authority is factually accurate, reliable and consistent, whether that evidence contains all relevant information which should be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn therefrom.\n(74)\nIn order to cover situations of extreme urgency and since the suspension of any decision of the resolution authorities might impede the continuity of critical functions, it is necessary to provide that the lodging of any appeal should not result in automatic suspension of the effects of the challenged decision and that the decision of the resolution authority should be immediately enforceable.\n(75)\nIn addition, where necessary in order to protect third parties who have acquired assets, contracts, rights and liabilities of the CCP under resolution in good faith by virtue of the exercise of the resolution powers by the resolution authorities and to ensure the stability of the financial markets, a right of appeal should not affect any subsequent administrative act or transaction concluded on the basis of an annulled decision. In such cases, remedies for a wrongful decision should therefore be limited to the award of compensation for the damages suffered by the affected persons.\n(76)\nIn the interest of efficient resolution, and in order to avoid conflicts of jurisdiction, no normal insolvency proceedings for the failing CCP should be opened or continued whilst the resolution authority is exercising its resolution powers or applying the resolution tools, except at the initiative or with the consent of the resolution authority. It is useful and necessary to suspend, for a limited period, certain contractual obligations so that the resolution authority has time to put into practice the resolution tools. However, this should not apply to obligations of a failing CCP towards systems designated under Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), including other CCPs and central banks. Directive 98/26/EC reduces the risk associated with participation in payment and securities settlement systems, in particular by reducing disruption in the event of the insolvency of a participant in such a system. In order to ensure that those protections apply appropriately in crisis situations, whilst maintaining appropriate certainty for operators of payment and securities settlement systems and other market participants, crisis prevention measures or resolution actions should not be deemed to be insolvency proceedings within the meaning of Directive 98/26/EC, provided that the substantive obligations under the contract continue to be performed. However, the operation of a system designated under or the right to collateral security guaranteed by, Directive 98/26/EC should not be undermined.\n(77)\nIn order to ensure that resolution authorities, when transferring assets and liabilities to a private sector purchaser or bridge CCP, have an adequate period to identify contracts that need to be transferred, it might be appropriate to impose proportionate restrictions on the rights of counterparties to close out, accelerate or otherwise terminate financial contracts before the transfer is made. Such a restriction would be necessary to allow authorities to obtain a true picture of the balance sheet of the failing CCP, without the changes in value and scope that extensive exercise of termination rights would entail. In order to interfere with the contractual rights of counterparties to the minimum extent necessary, the restriction on termination rights should be limited to the shortest period possible and apply only in relation to the crisis prevention measure or resolution action, including the occurrence of any event directly linked to the application of such a measure, and the rights to terminate arising from any other default, including failure to pay or deliver margins, should remain.\n(78)\nIn order to preserve legitimate capital market arrangements in the event of a transfer of some, but not all, of the assets, contracts, rights and liabilities of a failing CCP, it is appropriate to include safeguards to prevent, as appropriate, the splitting of linked liabilities, rights and contracts. Such a restriction on selected practices in relation to linked contracts and related collateral should extend to contracts with the same counterparty covered by security arrangements, title transfer financial collateral arrangements, set-off arrangements, close out netting arrangements, and structured finance arrangements. Where the safeguard applies, resolution authorities should seek to transfer all linked contracts within a protected arrangement, or leave them all with the residual failing CCP. Those safeguards should ensure that the regulatory capital treatment of exposures covered by a netting arrangement for the purposes of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) is affected to a minimum degree.\n(79)\nUnion CCPs provide services to clearing members and their clients located in third countries and third-country CCPs provide services to clearing members and their clients located in the Union. Effective resolution of internationally active CCPs requires cooperation between Member States and third-country authorities. For that purpose ESMA should provide guidance on the relevant content of cooperation arrangements to be concluded with authorities of third countries. Those cooperation arrangements should ensure effective planning, decision-making and coordination in respect of internationally active CCPs. National resolution authorities should recognise and enforce third-country resolution proceedings in certain circumstances. Cooperation should also take place with regard to subsidiaries of Union or third-country CCPs and their clearing members and their clients.\n(80)\nIn order to ensure the consistent application of administrative penalties across Member States for breaches of this Regulation, this Regulation should provide for a list of key administrative penalties and other administrative measures that need to be available to the resolution authorities and the competent authorities, for the power to impose those administrative penalties and other administrative measures on all persons, whether legal or natural, responsible for an infringement, and for a list of key criteria when determining the level and type of those administrative penalties and other administrative measures and for levels of administrative pecuniary penalties. Administrative penalties and other administrative measures should take into account factors such as any identified financial benefit resulting from the infringement, the gravity and duration of the infringement, any aggravating or mitigating factors, the need for administrative fines to have a deterrent effect and, where appropriate, include a discount for cooperation with the resolution authority or the competent authority. The adoption and publication of administrative penalties should respect fundamental rights as laid down in the Charter.\n(81)\nIn order to ensure consistent harmonisation and adequate protection for market participants across the Union, the Commission should be empowered to adopt draft regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 to specify the following elements: (a) the content of the written arrangements and procedures for the functioning of the resolution colleges; (b) the methodology for calculation and maintenance of the amount of the additional pre-funded dedicated own resources to be used by the CCP in recovery and the procedures, where such own resources are not available, for the CCP to resort to recovery measures that require contributions of non-defaulting clearing members and to subsequently reimburse such clearing members; (c) the assessment methodology for recovery plans; (d) the contents of resolution plans; (e) the order of allocation, maximum period and maximum share of the CCP’s annual profits under the recompense mechanism in recovery; (f) elements relevant to the conduct of valuations; (g) methodology for calculating the buffer for additional losses to be included in provisional valuations; (h) the minimum elements that should be included in a business reorganisation plan; (i) criteria that a business reorganisation plan is to fulfil; (j) the methodology for final valuation under the ‘no credit worse off’ principle; (k) the conditions for clearing members to pass on compensation to their clients in line with the contractual symmetry principle and the conditions under which it is to be considered proportionate.\n(82)\nThe Commission should be able to suspend any clearing obligation established pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, following a request from the resolution authority of a CCP under resolution or its competent authority, on their own initiative or at the request of the competent authority responsible for the supervision of a clearing member of the CCP under resolution, and following a non-binding opinion by ESMA, for a specific type of counterparty or for specific classes of OTC derivatives which are cleared by a CCP under resolution. The decision to suspend the clearing obligation should be adopted only if it is necessary to preserve financial stability and market confidence, in particular to avoid contagion effects and to prevent counterparties and investors having high and uncertain risk exposures to a CCP. In order to adopt its decision, the Commission should take into account the resolution objectives, the criteria stated in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for subjecting OTC derivatives to the clearing obligation regarding those OTC derivatives for which the suspension is requested and whether it is necessary to suspend the clearing obligation in order to preserve financial stability and the orderly functioning of financial markets in the Union. ESMA should be able to request the Commission to suspend the trading obligation laid down in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) where it considers the suspension of the clearing obligation to be a material change in the criteria for the trading obligation. The suspension should be of a temporary nature with a possibility of extension. Likewise, the role of the CCP’s risk committee, as set out in Article 28 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, should be enhanced to further encourage the CCP to manage its risks prudently and improve its resilience.\nMembers of the risk committee should be able to inform the competent authority when the CCP does not follow the risk committee’s advice, and representatives of clearing members and clients on the risk committee should be able to use information provided to monitor their exposures to the CCP, in accordance with confidentiality safeguards and without prejudice to the limitations to the exchange of such information laid out in competition law. Finally, resolution authorities of CCPs should also have access to all necessary information in trade repositories. Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(83)\nIn order to ensure the proper implementation of the interest rate benchmark reform of the FSB it is necessary to provide clarity to market participants that transactions entered into or novated before the entry into application of the clearing or margin requirements to OTC derivative transactions referencing an interest rate benchmark (legacy trades) will not be subject to the requirements as provided for in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 when they are novated for the sole purpose of implementing or preparing for the implementation of the interest rate benchmark reform. Doing so should also prevent any risk that Union counterparties to those legacy trades find themselves unprepared when a specific benchmark is materially changed or discontinued, therefore alleviating related financial stability concerns. Such approach is in line with the international guidance from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).\n(84)\nIn order to implement resolution of CCPs effectively, the safeguards provided for in Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should not apply to any restriction on the enforcement of a financial collateral arrangement or on the effect of a security financial collateral arrangement, any close-out netting or set-off provision provided for in this Regulation.\n(85)\nDirectives (EU) 2017/1132 (14), 2004/25/EC (15) and 2007/36/EC (16) of the European Parliament and of the Council contain rules on the protection of shareholders and creditors of CCPs that fall within the scope of those Directives. In a situation where resolution authorities need to act rapidly under this Regulation, those rules might hinder effective resolution action and application of resolution tools and powers by resolution authorities. Derogations under Directive 2014/59/EU should therefore be extended to actions taken pursuant to this Regulation. In order to guarantee the maximum degree of legal certainty for stakeholders, the derogations should be clearly and narrowly defined, and should only be used in the public interest and when resolution triggers are met.\n(86)\nIn order to avoid duplication of requirements, Directive 2014/59/EU and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) should be amended to exclude from their scope those entities that are also authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n(87)\nArticle 54(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provides for a transitional period during which Article 35 or 36 of that Regulation would not apply to those CCPs or trading venues which applied to their competent authority to benefit from the transitional arrangements, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives. The transitional period during which a trading venue or a CCP can be exempted by its national competent authority, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives from the application of Articles 35 and 36 of that Regulation expired on 3 July 2020. The current market environment, with a high degree of uncertainty and volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacts CCPs and trading venues’ operations by increasing their operational risks. Those increased risks, combined with limited capacity for assessing access requests and for managing the migration of transactions flows, might impact the orderly functioning of markets or financial stability. In addition, that Regulation provides for a novel exchange-traded derivatives regime on access to critical market infrastructures which aims to balance more competition amongst those infrastructures with the need to preserve their operational integrity.\nTherefore, while that Regulation seeks to create a competitive market for financial infrastructures, economic operators should not expect that existing rules and priorities are maintained when economic circumstances change as a consequence, in particular, of a major economic crisis. This is particularly the case in an area where the interaction between critical market infrastructures, such as trading and clearing infrastructures, requires an exceptional level of operational resilience, as any failures in such critical infrastructures would pose a high risk to financial stability. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the application date of the new open access regime for trading venues and CCPs offering trading and clearing services in relation to exchange-traded derivatives is postponed by one year, until 3 July 2021.\n(88)\nIn order to ensure that resolution authorities of CCPs are represented in all relevant fora, and to ensure that ESMA benefits from all expertise necessary to carry out the tasks related to the recovery and resolution of CCPs, Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 should be amended in order to include national CCP resolution authorities in the concept of competent authorities established by that Regulation.\n(89)\nIn order to prepare the decisions of ESMA in relation to the tasks allocated to it involving the development of draft technical standards on ex-ante and ex-post valuations and on resolution colleges and resolution plans, and of guidelines on the conditions for resolution, and on binding mediation, and to ensure the comprehensive involvement of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) and its members in the preparation of those decisions, ESMA should create an internal committee (the ‘ESMA Resolution Committee’) with resolution authorities as members. Where relevant, competent authorities defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), including the European Central Bank, and resolution authorities as defined in Directive 2014/59/EU, including the Single Resolution Board established by Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, should be invited to participate as observers.\n(90)\nThe ESMA Resolution Committee should be consulted in the preparation of the conceptual framework for the assessments of the resilience of CCPs to adverse market developments, when this assessment includes the aggregate effect of CCP recovery and resolution arrangements on Union financial stability. In such cases, the ESMA Resolution Committee should also be consulted when the findings of such stress tests are being assessed.\n(91)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the rights, freedoms and principles recognised by the Charter.\n(92)\nWhen taking decisions or actions under this Regulation, competent authorities and resolution authorities should always have due regard to the impact of their decisions and actions on financial stability in other Member States and on the economic situation in other Member States where the CCP’s operations are critical or important for local financial markets, including where clearing members and, where relevant information is available, their clients are located and where linked trading venues and financial market infrastructures, including interoperable CCPs, are established.\n(93)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the harmonisation of the rules and processes for the recovery and resolution of CCPs, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the effects of a failure of any CCPs in the whole Union, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(94)\nThe application of this Regulation should be deferred until 12 August 2022 to establish all essential implementing measures and to allow CCPs and other market participants to take the necessary steps for compliance purposes. However, the requirement for the CCP to use dedicated own resources in recovery and the provisions to recompense clearing members in the extraordinary case of applying variation margin gains haircutting in recovery, rely on the appropriate regulatory technical standards to be in place. It is therefore appropriate to extend the deferral of the date of application for such provision until 12 February 2023. Additionally, certain provisions that apply to CCP recovery plans and the adoption and review of recovery plans, including the obligation to submit a recovery plan, should be applied from an earlier date, since all CCPs already have recovery plans, as required by the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures published by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the IOSCO. CCPs already authorised under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should take the appropriate steps to ensure that they will be able to submit their recovery plans to their competent authorities at the latest on 12 February 2022. Those provisions related to recovery plans should be applied from 12 February 2022. If the resolution authority had not been consulted on the recovery plan of the CCP, once the other provisions of this Regulation become applicable, the competent authority of the CCP should consult the resolution authority on the CCP’s recovery plan without delay. In order to ensure legal certainty for counterparties, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 intended to ensure the proper implementation of the FSB’s interest rate benchmark reform should apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(95)\nIn order to ensure that increased operational risks stemming from the application of the open access regime for exchange-traded derivatives do not endanger the orderly functioning of markets or financial stability and to avoid any discontinuity, it is necessary to retroactively apply the extension of such transitional periods from 4 July 2020 until 3 July 2021.\n(96)\nThis Regulation should ensure that CCPs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity to ensure smooth and fast absorption of losses and recapitalisation with a minimum impact on financial stability while aiming to avoid an impact on taxpayers. Consistently with the internationally agreed principles for effective resolution regimes for financial institutions developed by the FSB, this Regulation should ensure that equity holders of a CCP absorb losses first in resolution in a way that minimises the risk of legal challenge by equity holders, on the basis that their losses in resolution are greater than the losses that they would have incurred under normal insolvency proceedings according to the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle. On 15 November 2018, the FSB published a consultation paper entitled ‘Financial resources to support CCP resolution and the treatment of CCP equity in resolution’.\nBased on the feedback received to that paper and further assessments, the FSB plans to issue guidance at the end of 2020 on how equity should be used in the event of resolution of CCPs in a manner that minimises the risk of legal challenge by equity holders resulting from the application of the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle. Following the publication of that guidance, the Commission should review the application of the rules laid down in this Regulation with regard to the write-down of equity in resolution by taking into account those internationally agreed standards. In addition to this specific review, the Commission should review the application of this Regulation after five years from the date of its entry into force, inter alia, by taking into account any further international developments. That general review should cover at least certain core matters related to the recovery and resolution of CCPs, such as financial resources available to resolution authorities to cover non-default losses and the CCPs’ own resources to be used in recovery and resolution,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down

In particular, arrangements shall be put in place to ensure effective operational independence, including separate staff, reporting lines and decision making process of that resolution authority, from any tasks that the resolution authority may perform pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 as a competent authority of the CCP and from the tasks that the resolution authority may perform as the competent authority of the clearing members referred to in point (c) of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n4.   The requirements expressed in paragraph 3 shall not preclude that reporting lines converge at the highest level of an organisation that subsumes different functions or authorities, or that, staff may, under predefined conditions, be shared between the other functions entrusted to the resolution authority to meet temporarily high workloads, or for the resolution authority to be able to avail itself of the expertise of shared staff.\n5.   Authorities exercising supervision and resolution functions under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and this Regulation, and persons exercising those functions on their behalf, shall cooperate closely in the preparation, planning and application of resolution decisions, both where the resolution authority and the competent authority are separate entities and where the functions are carried out by the same entity.\n6.

Resolution authorities shall provide the competent ministry with all information relating to decisions or measures that require notification, consultation or consent of that ministry.\nTITLE III\nPREPARATION\nCHAPTER I\nRecovery and resolution planning\nSection 1\nRecovery planning\nArticle 9\nRecovery plans\n1.   CCPs shall draw up and maintain a recovery plan providing for measures to be taken in the case of both default and non-default events and combinations of both, in order to restore their financial soundness, without any extraordinary public financial support, and allow them to continue to provide critical functions following a significant deterioration of their financial situation or a risk of breaching their capital and prudential requirements under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n2.   The measures included in the recovery plan shall:\n(a)\ncomprehensively and effectively address all the risks identified in the different scenarios, including possible uncovered liquidity shortfalls;\n(b)\nin the case of losses due to a default event, ensure the re-establishment of a matched book and the full allocation of uncovered losses to clearing members, and to their clients if those clients are direct creditors of the CCP, and to shareholders, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders;\n(c)\ninclude loss-absorbing arrangements that are adequate to cover the losses that might arise from all types of non-default events; and\n(d)\nenable the replenishment of the CCP’s financial resources, including its own funds, to a level sufficient in order for the CCP to meet its obligations under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and to support the continued and timely operation of the critical functions of the CCP.\n3.   The recovery plan shall include a framework of indicators based on the risk profile of the CCP, that identify the circumstances under which measures in the recovery plan are to be taken. The indicators may be of either a qualitative or a quantitative nature relating to the financial soundness and operational viability of the CCP and should enable recovery measures to be taken early enough to provide sufficient time for the plan to be implemented.\n4.   CCPs shall put in place appropriate arrangements for the regular monitoring of the indicators referred to in paragraph 3. CCPs shall report to their competent authorities on the outcome of that monitoring. Competent authorities shall transmit information to the supervisory college, where they deem such information significant.\n5.   ESMA shall, in cooperation with the ESRB, by 12 February 2022, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 to specify the minimum list of qualitative and quantitative indicators referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.\n6.   CCPs shall include provisions in their operating rules, outlining the procedures to be followed by them where, in order to achieve the goals of the recovery process, they propose to:\n(a)\ntake measures provided for in their recovery plan despite the fact that the relevant indicators have not been met; or\n(b)\nrefrain from taking measures provided for in their recovery plan despite the fact that the relevant indicators have been met.\nAny decision taken pursuant to this paragraph and its justification shall be notified to the competent authority without delay.\n7.   Where a CCP intends to activate its recovery plan, it shall notify the competent authority of the nature and magnitude of the problems it has identified, setting out all relevant circumstances and indicating the recovery measures or other measures it intends to take to address the situation as well as the envisaged time-frame to restore its financial soundness by use of those measures.\nWhere the competent authority considers that a recovery measure that the CCP intends to take may cause significant adverse effects to the financial system or is unlikely to be effective, it may require the CCP to refrain from taking that measure.\nFollowing the notification received under the second subparagraph of paragraph 6 of this Article, the competent authority shall immediately assess whether the circumstances require the use of early intervention powers in accordance with Article 18.\n8.   The competent authority shall promptly inform the resolution authority and the supervisory college, and the resolution authority shall promptly inform the resolution college, of any notification received in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 6 and with the first subparagraph of paragraph 7, and of any subsequent instruction by the competent authority in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 7.\nWhere the competent authority is informed in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 7 of this Article, it shall restrict or prohibit any remuneration of equity and instruments treated as equity, including dividend payments and buybacks by the CCP, to the fullest extent possible without triggering an event of default, and it may restrict or prohibit any payments of variable remuneration as defined by the CCP’s remuneration policy pursuant to Article 26(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, discretionary pension benefits or severance packages to senior management as defined in point 29 of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n9.   CCPs shall, at least annually and in any case after any change to their legal or organisational structure or business or financial situation which could have a material effect on those plans or otherwise necessitate a change to the plans, review, test and, where necessary, update their recovery plans. Competent authorities may require CCPs to update their recovery plans more frequently.\n10.   Recovery plans shall be drawn up in accordance with Section A of the Annex and take into account all relevant interdependencies within the group to which the CCP belongs. Competent authorities may require CCPs to include additional information in their recovery plans. Where relevant, the competent authority of the CCP shall consult the competent authority of the CCP’s parent undertaking.\n11.   Recovery plans shall:\n(a)\nnot assume any access to or receipt of extraordinary public financial support, central bank emergency liquidity assistance or central bank liquidity assistance provided under non-standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms;\n(b)\nconsider the interests of all stakeholders that are likely to be affected by the plan, including clearing members and, to the extent that the information is available, their direct and indirect clients; and\n(c)\nensure that clearing members do not have unlimited exposures toward the CCP and stakeholders’ potential losses and liquidity shortfalls are transparent, measurable, manageable and controllable.\n12.   ESMA shall, in cooperation with the ESRB, by 12 February 2022 issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 further specifying the range of scenarios to be considered for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article. In issuing such guidelines, ESMA shall take into account, where appropriate, supervisory stress testing exercises.\n13.   Where the CCP is part of a group and contractual parental or group support agreements form part of the recovery plan, the recovery plan shall contemplate scenarios in which those agreements cannot be honoured.\n14.   Following a default or a non-default event, a CCP shall use an additional amount of its pre-funded dedicated own resources, prior to the use of the arrangements and measures referred to in point 15 of Section A of the Annex to this Regulation. That amount shall not be lower than 10 % nor higher than 25 % of the risk-based capital requirements calculated in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\nTo comply with that requirement, the CCP may use the amount of capital it holds, in addition to its minimum capital requirements, to comply with the notification threshold referred to in the delegated act adopted on the basis of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n15.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with EBA and after consulting the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the methodology for calculation and maintenance of the additional amount of pre-funded dedicated own resources to be used in accordance with paragraph 14. When developing those technical standards, ESMA shall take into account all of the following:\n(a)\nthe structure and the internal organisation of CCPs and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities;\n(b)\nthe structure of incentives of the shareholders, management and clearing members of CCPs and of the clients of clearing members;\n(c)\nthe appropriateness for CCPs, depending on the currencies in which the financial instruments they clear are denominated, the currencies accepted as collateral and the risk stemming from their activities, in particular where they do not clear OTC derivatives as defined in point (7) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, to invest that additional amount of dedicated own resources in assets other than those referred to in Article 47(1) of that Regulation; and\n(d)\nthe rules applying to and the practices of third-country CCPs, as well as the international developments concerning the recovery and resolution of CCPs, in order to preserve the competitiveness of internationally active Union CCPs, and the competitiveness of Union CCPs compared to third-country CCPs providing clearing services in the Union.\nWhere ESMA concludes, on the basis of the criteria referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph, that it is appropriate for certain CCPs to invest that additional amount of pre-funded dedicated own resources in assets other than those referred to in Article 47(1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, it shall also specify:\n(a)\nthe procedure through which, in the event that those resources are not immediately available, CCPs may resort to recovery measures that require the financial contribution of non-defaulting clearing members;\n(b)\nthe procedure that CCPs shall follow to subsequently reimburse the non-defaulting clearing members referred to in point (a) up to the amount to be used in accordance with paragraph 14 of this Article.\nESMA shall submit the draft regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph to the Commission by 12 February 2022.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n16.   The CCP shall develop adequate mechanisms to involve linked FMIs and stakeholders which would bear losses, incur costs or contribute to cover liquidity shortfalls in the event that the recovery plan was implemented in the process of drawing-up of that plan.\n17.   The board of the CCP shall assess, taking into account the advice of the risk committee in accordance with Article 28(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and approve the recovery plan before submitting it to the competent authority.\n18.   Where the board of the CCP has decided not to follow the advice of the risk committee, it shall promptly inform the competent authority in accordance with Article 28(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and explain its decision in detail to the competent authority.\n19.   Recovery plans shall be integrated in the corporate governance and the overall risk management framework of the CCP.\n20.   The measures set out in the recovery plans that create financial or contractual obligations on clearing members and, where relevant, clients and indirect clients, linked FMIs or trading venues shall form part of the operating rules of CCPs.\n21.   CCPs shall ensure that the measures set out in the recovery plans are enforceable at all times in all jurisdictions where the clearing members, linked FMIs or trading venues are located.\n22.   The obligation of CCPs to include in their recovery plans the right to make a recovery cash call and, if applicable, to reduce the value of any gains payable by the CCPs to non-defaulting clearing members shall not be applicable to the entities referred to in Articles 1(4) and 1(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n23.   Clearing members shall communicate to their clients in a clear and transparent manner if and in what way measures in the CCP’s recovery plan may affect them.\nArticle 10\nAssessment of recovery plans\n1.   CCPs shall submit their recovery plans to the competent authority.\n2.   The competent authority shall transmit each plan to the supervisory college and to the resolution authority without undue delay. The competent authority shall review the recovery plan and assess the extent to which it satisfies the requirements set out in Article 9 within six months of the submission of the plan and in coordination with the supervisory college in accordance with the procedure in Article 11.\n3.   When assessing the recovery plan, the competent authority and the supervisory college shall take into consideration the following factors:\n(a)\nthe CCP’s capital structure, its default waterfall, the level of complexity of the organisational structure, the substitutability of its activities and the risk profile of the CCP, including in terms of financial, operational and cyber risks;\n(b)\nthe overall impact that the implementation of the recovery plan would have on:\n(i)\nclearing members, and to the extent the information is available, their clients and indirect clients, including where they have been designated as O-SIIs;\n(ii)\nany linked FMIs;\n(iii)\nfinancial markets, including trading venues, served by the CCP; and\n(iv)\nthe financial system of any Member State and the Union as a whole;\n(c)\nwhether the recovery tools and their sequence specified by the recovery plan create appropriate incentives for the CCP’s owners, clearing members, and where possible their clients, as relevant, to control the amount of risk that they bring to or incur in the system, monitor the CCP’s risk-taking and risk management activities and contribute to the CCP’s default management process.\n4.   When assessing the recovery plan, the competent authority shall take parental support agreements into consideration as valid parts of the recovery plan only where those agreements are contractually binding.\n5.   The resolution authority shall examine the recovery plan in order to identify any measures which may adversely impact the resolvability of the CCP. Where any such measures are identified, the resolution authority shall bring them to the attention of the competent authority and make recommendations to the competent authority on ways to address the adverse impact of those measures on the resolvability of the CCP, within two months of the transmission of each recovery plan by the competent authority.\n6.   Where the competent authority decides not to act on the recommendations of the resolution authority pursuant to paragraph 5, it shall fully justify that decision to the resolution authority.\n7.   Where the competent authority agrees with the recommendations of the resolution authority, or considers in coordination with the supervisory college in accordance with Article 11 that there are material deficiencies in the recovery plan or material impediments to its implementation, it shall notify the CCP and shall give it the opportunity to submit its views.\n8.   The competent authority, taking into account the CCP’s views, may require the CCP to submit, within two months, extendable by one month with the competent authority’s approval, a revised plan demonstrating how those deficiencies or impediments are addressed. The revised plan shall be assessed in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 7.\n9.   Where the competent authority, after consulting the resolution authority and in coordination with the supervisory college in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 11, considers that the deficiencies and impediments have not been adequately addressed by the revised plan, or where the CCP has not submitted a revised plan, it shall require the CCP to make specific changes to the plan within a reasonable period, as defined by the competent authority.\n10.   Where it is not possible to adequately remedy the deficiencies or impediments through specific changes to the plan, the competent authority, after consulting the resolution authority and in coordination with the supervisory college in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 11, shall require the CCP to identify within a reasonable timeframe any changes to be made to its business in order to address the deficiencies in or impediments to the implementation of the recovery plan.\nWhere the CCP fails to identify such changes within the timeframe set by the competent authority, or where the competent authority, after consulting the resolution authority and in coordination with the supervisory college in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 11, considers that the actions proposed would not adequately address the deficiencies or impediments to the implementation of the recovery plan, the competent authority shall require the CCP to take within a reasonable period, as defined by the competent authority, specified actions with regard to one or more of the following objectives, taking into account the seriousness of the deficiencies and impediments and the effect of the measures on the CCP’s business and ability to remain in compliance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012:\n(a)\nto reduce the risk profile of the CCP;\n(b)\nto enhance the CCP’s ability to be recapitalised in a timely manner to meet its capital and prudential requirements;\n(c)\nto review the CCP’s strategy and structure;\n(d)\nto make changes to the default waterfall, recovery measures and other loss allocation arrangements so as to improve resolvability and the resilience of critical functions;\n(e)\nto make changes to the governance structure of the CCP.\n11.   The request referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 10 shall be reasoned and notified in writing to the CCP.\n12.   ESMA, in cooperation with the ESCB and the ESRB, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards further specifying the factors referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 3.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 12 February 2022.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 11\nCoordination procedure for recovery plans\n1.   The supervisory college shall examine the recovery plan and, where any member of the college considers that there are material deficiencies in the recovery plan or any material impediment to its implementation, that member shall make recommendations to the competent authority of the CCP with regard to those matters within two months of the transmission of the recovery plan by the competent authority.\n2.   The supervisory college shall reach a joint decision on all of the following issues:\n(a)\nthe review and assessment of the recovery plan;\n(b)\nthe application of the measures referred to in Article 10(7), (8), (9) and (10).\n3.   The supervisory college shall reach a joint decision on the issues referred to in paragraph 2 within four months of the date of the transmission of the recovery plan by the competent authority.\nESMA may, at the request of a competent authority within the supervisory college, assist the supervisory college in reaching a joint decision in accordance with point (c) of Article 31(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n4.   Where, after four months from the date of transmission of the recovery plan, the college has failed to reach a joint decision on the issues referred to in paragraph 2, the competent authority of the CCP shall make its own decision.\nThe competent authority of the CCP shall make the decision referred to in the first subparagraph taking into account the views of the other college members expressed during the four-month period. The competent authority of the CCP shall notify in writing that decision to the CCP and to the other members of the college.\n5.   Where, by the end of that four-month period, a joint decision has not been reached and a simple majority of the voting members disagree with the competent authority’s proposal for a joint decision on a matter in relation to the assessment of recovery plans or implementation of the measures pursuant to points (a), (b) and (d) of Article 10(10) of this Regulation, any of the voting members concerned, based on that majority, may refer that matter to ESMA in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. The competent authority of the CCP shall await the decision taken by ESMA in accordance with Article 19(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and decide in accordance with the decision of ESMA.\n6.   The four-month period shall be deemed to be the conciliation phase within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. ESMA shall take its decision within one month of the referral of the matter to it. The matter shall not be referred to ESMA after the end of the four-month period or after a joint decision has been reached. In the absence of an ESMA decision within one month, the decision of the competent authority of the CCP shall apply.\nSection 2\nResolution planning\nArticle 12\nResolution plans\n1.   The resolution authority of the CCP shall, after consultation with the competent authority and in coordination with the resolution college, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 14, draw up a resolution plan for the CCP.\n2.   The resolution plan shall provide for the resolution actions that the resolution authority may take where the CCP meets the conditions for resolution referred to in Article 22.\n3.   The resolution plan shall take into consideration at least the following:\n(a)\nthe CCP’s failure, including in situations of broader financial instability or system wide events, due to one of the following or their combination:\n(i)\ndefault events, and\n(ii)\nnon-default events;\n(b)\nthe impact that the implementation of the resolution plan would have on:\n(i)\nthe clearing members, and to the extent the information is available, their clients and indirect clients, including where they have been designated as O-SIIs and those likely to be subject to recovery measures or resolution actions in accordance with Directive 2014/59/EU;\n(ii)\nany linked FMIs;\n(iii)\nfinancial markets, including trading venues, served by the CCP; and\n(iv)\nthe financial system in any Member State or the Union as a whole, and, to the extent possible, in third countries where it provides services;\n(c)\nthe manner and the circumstances under which a CCP may apply for the use of central bank facilities provided under standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms and the identification of the assets that would be expected to qualify as collateral.\n4.   The resolution plan shall not assume any of the following:\n(a)\nextraordinary public financial support;\n(b)\ncentral bank emergency liquidity assistance;\n(c)\ncentral bank liquidity assistance provided under non-standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms.\n5.   The resolution plan shall make prudent assumptions regarding the financial resources available as resolution tools that may be required to achieve the resolution objectives and the resources that are expected to be available in accordance with the CCP’s rules and arrangements at the time of entering into resolution. Those prudent assumptions shall take into account the relevant findings of latest stress tests carried out in accordance with Article 32(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, specified in point (b) of Article 24a(7) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, as well as scenarios of extreme market conditions beyond those in the CCP’s recovery plan.\n6.   The resolution authority of a CCP shall, after consultation with the competent authority and in coordination with the resolution college in accordance with the procedure in Article 14, review resolution plans and where appropriate update them, at least annually and in any case after changes to the legal or organisational structure of the CCP, its business or financial situation or any other change that materially affects the effectiveness of the plan.\nThe CCP and the competent authority shall promptly inform the resolution authority of any such change.\n7.   The resolution plan shall specify the circumstances and different scenarios for applying the resolution tools and exercising the resolution powers. It shall clearly distinguish, in particular through different scenarios, between failure caused by default events, non-default events, and a combination of both, as well as between different types of non-default events. The resolution plan shall include the following, quantified whenever appropriate and possible:\n(a)\na summary of the key elements of the plan, distinguishing between default events, non-default events and a combination of the two;\n(b)\na summary of the material changes to the CCP that have occurred since the resolution plan was last updated;\n(c)\na description of how the CCP’s critical functions could be legally and economically separated, to the extent necessary, from its other functions so as to ensure the continuity of its critical functions in the resolution of the CCP;\n(d)\nan estimation of the timeframe for implementing each material aspect of the plan, including for replenishing the CCP’s financial resources;\n(e)\na detailed description of the assessment of resolvability carried out in accordance with Article 15;\n(f)\na description of any measures required pursuant to Article 16 to address or remove impediments to resolvability identified as a result of the assessment carried out in accordance with Article 15;\n(g)\na description of the processes for determining the value and marketability of the critical functions and assets of the CCP;\n(h)\na detailed description of the arrangements for ensuring that the information required pursuant to Article 13 is up to date and available to the resolution authorities at all times;\n(i)\nan explanation as to how resolution actions could be financed without the assumption of the elements referred to in paragraph 4;\n(j)\na detailed description of the different resolution strategies that could be applied according to the different possible scenarios and their related timeframes;\n(k)\na description of critical interdependencies between the CCP and other market participants and between the CCP and critical service providers, interoperability arrangements and links with other FMIs, as well as ways to address all of those interdependencies;\n(l)\na description of critical intra-group interdependencies as well as ways to address them;\n(m)\na description of the different options to ensure:\n(i)\naccess to payments and clearing services and other infrastructures;\n(ii)\ntimely settlement of obligations due to clearing members and, where applicable, their clients and any linked FMIs;\n(iii)\naccess of clearing members, and, where applicable, their clients on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis to securities or cash accounts provided by the CCP and securities or cash collateral posted to and held by the CCP that is owed to such participants;\n(iv)\ncontinuity in the operations of links between the CCP and other FMIs and between the CCP and trading venues;\n(v)\npreservation of the portability of the positions and related assets of direct and indirect clients; and\n(vi)\npreservation of the licenses, authorisations, recognitions and legal designations of a CCP where necessary for the continued performance of the CCP’s critical functions including its recognition for the purposes of the application of the relevant settlement finality rules and the participation in or links with other FMIs or with trading venues;\n(n)\na description of how the resolution authority will obtain the necessary information to perform the valuation referred to in Article 24;\n(o)\nan analysis of the impact of the plan on the employees of the CCP, including an assessment of any associated costs, and a description of envisaged procedures to consult with staff during the resolution process, taking into account any national rules and systems for dialogue with social partners;\n(p)\na plan for communicating with the media and the public so as to be as transparent as possible;\n(q)\na description of essential operations and systems for maintaining the continuous functioning of the CCP’s operational processes;\n(r)\na description of the arrangements for notifying the resolution college in accordance with Article 72(1);\n(s)\na description of the measures to facilitate the portability of positions and related assets of the clearing members and clients of the defaulting CCP from the defaulting CCP to another CCP or a bridge CCP while not affecting the contractual relationships between the clearing members and their clients.\n8.   The information referred to in point (a) of paragraph 7 shall be disclosed to the CCP concerned. The CCP may express its opinion in writing on the resolution plan to the resolution authority. That opinion shall be included in the plan.\n9.   ESMA, after consulting the ESRB and taking into account the relevant provisions of the delegated acts adopted on the basis of Article 10(9) of Directive 2014/59/EU and respecting the principle of proportionality shall develop draft regulatory technical standards further specifying the contents of the resolution plan in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article.\nWhen developing the draft regulatory technical standards, ESMA shall enable sufficient flexibility for resolution authorities to take into consideration the specificities of their national legal framework in the area of insolvency law, as well as the nature and complexity of the clearing business performed by the CCPs.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 12 February 2022.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 13\nCCPs’ duty to cooperate and provide information\n1.   CCPs shall cooperate as necessary in the drawing up of resolution plans and provide their resolution authority, either directly or through their competent authority, with all the information necessary to draw up and implement those plans, including the information and analysis specified in Section B of the Annex.\nCompetent authorities shall provide resolution authorities with any information referred to in the first subparagraph which is already available to them.\n2.   Resolution authorities may require CCPs to provide them with detailed records of the contracts referred to in Article 29 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 to which they are a party. Resolution authorities may specify a time limit to provide those records and may specify different time limits for different types of contracts.\n3.   A CCP shall exchange information in a timely manner with its competent authorities in order to facilitate the assessment of the risk profiles of the CCP and the interconnectedness with other FMIs, other financial institutions and with the financial system in general as referred to in Articles 9 and 10. Competent authorities shall transmit information to the supervisory college, where they deem such information significant.\nArticle 14\nCoordination procedure for resolution plans\n1.   The resolution authority shall transmit to the resolution college a draft resolution plan, the information provided in accordance with Article 13 and any additional information relevant to the resolution college.\n2.   The resolution college shall reach a joint decision regarding the resolution plan and any changes thereto within a four-month period from the date of the transmission of that plan by the resolution authority referred to in paragraph 1.\nThe resolution authority shall ensure that ESMA is provided with all the information that is relevant to its role in accordance with this Article.\n3.   The resolution authority may, in accordance with Article 4(4), decide to involve third-country authorities when drawing up and reviewing the resolution plan, provided that they meet the confidentiality requirements laid down in Article 73 and are from jurisdictions in which any of the following entities are established:\n(a)\nthe CCP’s parent undertaking, where applicable;\n(b)\nthe clearing members of the CCP where their contribution to the default fund of the CCP is, on an aggregate basis over a one-year period, higher than those of the third Member State with the largest contributions as referred to in point (c) of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;\n(c)\nthe CCP’s subsidiaries, where applicable;\n(d)\nother providers of critical services to the CCP;\n(e)\ninteroperable CCPs.\n4.   ESMA may, at the request of a resolution authority, assist the resolution college in reaching a joint decision in accordance with point (c) of Article 31(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n5.   Where, after four months from the date of transmission of the resolution plan, the resolution college has failed to reach a joint decision, the resolution authority shall make its own decision on the resolution plan. The resolution authority shall make its decision taking into account the views of the other resolution college members expressed during the four-month period. The resolution authority shall notify in writing the decision to the CCP and to the other members of the resolution college.\n6.   Where, by the end of the four-month period referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, a joint decision has not been reached and a simple majority of the voting members disagree with the resolution authority’s proposal for a joint decision on a matter in relation to the resolution plan, any of the voting members concerned, based on that majority, may refer that matter to ESMA in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. The resolution authority of the CCP shall await the decision taken by ESMA in accordance with Article 19(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and decide in accordance with the decision of ESMA.\nThe four-month period shall be deemed to be the conciliation phase within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. ESMA shall take its decision within one month of the referral of the matter to it. The matter shall not be referred to ESMA after the end of the four-month period or after a joint decision has been reached. In the absence of an ESMA decision within one month, the decision of the resolution authority shall apply.\n7.   Where a joint decision is taken pursuant to paragraph 1 and any resolution authority or competent ministry considers under paragraph 6 that the subject matter of the disagreement impinges on the fiscal responsibilities of its Member State, the resolution authority of the CCP shall initiate a reassessment of the resolution plan.\nCHAPTER II\nResolvability\nArticle 15\nAssessment of resolvability\n1.   The resolution authority, in coordination with the resolution college in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 17, and after consultation with the competent authority, shall assess the extent to which a CCP is resolvable without assuming any of the following:\n(a)\nextraordinary public financial support;\n(b)\ncentral bank emergency liquidity assistance;\n(c)\ncentral bank liquidity assistance provided under non-standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms.\n2.   A CCP shall be deemed resolvable where the resolution authority considers it feasible and credible to either liquidate it under normal insolvency proceedings or to resolve it applying the resolution tools and exercising the resolution powers while ensuring the continuity of the CCP’s critical functions and avoiding any use of extraordinary public financial support and, to the maximum extent possible, any significant adverse effect on the financial system and the potential for undue disadvantage to affected stakeholders.\nThe adverse effects referred to in the first subparagraph shall include broader financial instability or system wide events in any Member State.\nThe resolution authority shall notify ESMA in a timely manner where it considers that a CCP is not resolvable.\n3.   Upon request by the resolution authority, a CCP shall demonstrate that:\n(a)\nthere are no impediments to the reduction of the value of instruments of ownership following the exercise of resolution powers, regardless of whether outstanding contractual arrangements or other measures in the CCP’s recovery plan have been fully exhausted; and\n(b)\nthe contracts of the CCP with clearing members or third parties do not enable those clearing members or third parties to successfully challenge the exercise of resolution powers by a resolution authority or otherwise avoid being subject to those powers.\n4.   For the purposes of the assessment of resolvability referred to in paragraph 1, the resolution authority shall, as relevant, examine the matters specified in Section C of the Annex.\n5.   By 12 August 2022, ESMA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, shall issue guidelines to promote the convergence of resolution practices regarding the application of Section C of the Annex to this Regulation in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n6.   The resolution authority in coordination with the resolution college shall make the resolvability assessment at the same time as drawing up and updating the resolution plan in accordance with Article 12.\nArticle 16\nAddressing or removing impediments to resolvability\n1.   Where, following the assessment in Article 15, the resolution authority, in coordination with the resolution college in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 17, concludes that there are material impediments to the resolvability of a CCP, the resolution authority, in cooperation with the competent authority, shall prepare and submit a report to the CCP and to the resolution college.\nThe report referred to in the first subparagraph shall analyse the material impediments to the effective application of the resolution tools and the exercise of the resolution powers in relation to the CCP, consider their impact on the business model of the CCP and recommend targeted measures to remove those impediments.\n2.   The requirement laid down in Article 14 for resolution colleges to reach a joint decision on resolution plans shall be suspended following the submission of the report referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article until the measures to remove the material impediments to resolvability have been accepted by the resolution authority pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article or alternative measures have been decided pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article.\n3.   Within four months of the date of receipt of the report submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the CCP shall propose to the resolution authority possible measures to address or remove the material impediments identified in the report. The resolution authority shall communicate to the resolution college any measure proposed by the CCP. The resolution authority and resolution college shall assess, in accordance with point (b) of Article 17(1), whether those measures effectively address or remove those impediments.\n4.   Where the resolution authority in coordination with the resolution college in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 17 concludes that the measures proposed by a CCP in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article would not effectively reduce or remove the impediments identified in the report, the resolution authority shall identify alternative measures which it shall communicate to the resolution college for joint decision in accordance with point (c) of Article 17(1).\nThe alternative measures referred to in the first subparagraph shall take into account the following:\n(a)\nthe threat to financial stability of those material impediments to the resolvability of a CCP;\n(b)\nthe likely effect of the alternative measures on:\n(i)\nthe CCP, including its business model and operational efficiency;\n(ii)\nits clearing members, and to the extent the information is available, their clients and indirect clients, including where they have been designated as O-SIIs;\n(iii)\nany linked FMIs;\n(iv)\nfinancial markets, including trading venues, served by the CCP;\n(v)\nthe financial system in any Member State or the Union as a whole; and\n(vi)\nthe internal market; and\n(c)\nthe effects on the provision of integrated clearing services for different products and portfolio margining across asset classes.\nFor the purposes of points (a) and (b) of the second subparagraph, the resolution authority shall consult the competent authority and the resolution college and, where appropriate, relevant designated national macroprudential authorities.\n5.   The resolution authority shall notify the CCP in writing, either directly or indirectly through the competent authority, of the alternative measures to take in order to achieve the objective of removing impediments to resolvability. The resolution authority shall justify why the measures proposed by the CCP would not be able to remove the material impediments to resolvability and how the alternative measures would be effective in doing so.\n6.   The CCP shall propose within one month a plan to comply with the alternative measures, with a reasonable timeframe for the implementation of the plan. If deemed necessary by the resolution authority, the resolution authority may shorten or extend the proposed timeframe.\n7.   For the purposes of paragraph 4, the resolution authority may, after consulting the competent authority and while allowing for a reasonable timeframe for implementation:\n(a)\nrequire the CCP to revise or draw up service agreements, whether intra-group or with third parties, to cover the provision of critical functions;\n(b)\nrequire the CCP to limit its maximum individual and aggregate uncovered exposures;\n(c)\nrequire the CCP to make changes to how it collects and holds margins pursuant to Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;\n(d)\nrequire the CCP to make changes to the composition and number of its default funds referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;\n(e)\nimpose on the CCP specific or regular additional information requirements;\n(f)\nrequire the CCP to divest specific assets;\n(g)\nrequire the CCP to limit or cease specific existing or proposed activities;\n(h)\nrequire the CCP to make changes to its recovery plan, operating rules and other contractual arrangements;\n(i)\nrestrict or prevent the development of new or existing business lines or provision of new or existing services;\n(j)\nrequire changes to legal or operational structures of the CCP or any group entity directly or indirectly under its control to ensure that critical functions may be legally and operationally separated from other functions through the application of resolutions tools;\n(k)\nrequire the CCP to operationally and financially segregate its different clearing services so as to isolate some specific asset classes from other asset classes and where deemed appropriate, to restrict netting sets covering different asset classes;\n(l)\nrequire the CCP to set up a parent undertaking in the Union;\n(m)\nrequire the CCP to issue liabilities that can be written down and converted or to set aside other financial resources to increase the capacity for loss absorption, recapitalisation and the replenishment of pre-funded resources;\n(n)\nrequire the CCP to take other steps to enable capital, other liabilities and contracts to be able to absorb losses, to recapitalise the CCP or to replenish pre-funded resources. Actions considered may include in particular attempting to renegotiate any liability the CCP has issued or to revise contractual terms, with a view to ensuring that any decision of the resolution authority to write down, convert or restructure that liability, instrument or contract would be effected under the law of the jurisdiction governing that liability or instrument;\n(o)\nwhere the CCP is a subsidiary, coordinate with relevant authorities with a view to requiring the parent undertaking to set up a separate holding company to control the CCP, where that measure is necessary in order to facilitate the resolution of the CCP and to avoid the adverse effects that the application of the resolution tools and the exercise of the resolution powers could have on other entities of the group;\n(p)\nrestrict or prohibit interoperability links of the CCP where such a restriction or prohibition is necessary in order to avoid adverse effects on the achievement of resolution objectives.\nArticle 17\nCoordination procedure to address or remove impediments to resolvability\n1.   The resolution college shall reach a joint decision regarding:\n(a)\nthe identification of the material impediments to resolvability pursuant to Article 15(1);\n(b)\nthe assessment of the measures proposed by the CCP pursuant to Article 16(3), as necessary;\n(c)\nthe alternative measures required pursuant to Article 16(4).\n2.   The joint decision on the identification of material impediments to resolvability referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted within four months of the submission of the report referred to in Article 16(1) to the resolution college.\n3.   The joint decision referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted within four months of submission of the CCP’s proposed measures to remove impediments to resolvability as referred to in Article 16(3).\n4.   The joint decision referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted within four months of the communication of the alternative measures to the resolution college as referred to in Article 16(4).\n5.   The joint decisions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reasoned and notified in writing by the resolution authority to the CCP and, where the resolution authority deems it relevant, its parent undertaking.\n6.   ESMA may, at the request of the resolution authority of the CCP, assist the resolution college in reaching a joint decision in accordance with point (c) of Article 31(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n7.   Where, after four months from the date of transmission of the report provided for in Article 16(1), the resolution college has failed to adopt a joint decision, the resolution authority shall take its own decision on the appropriate measures to be taken in accordance with Article 16(5). The resolution authority shall take its decision having taken into account the views of the other resolution college members expressed during the four-month period.\nThe resolution authority shall notify the decision to the CCP, to its parent undertaking where relevant, and to the other members of the resolution college in writing.\n8.   Where, by the end of the four-month period referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article, a joint decision has not been reached and a simple majority of the voting members disagree with the resolution authority’s proposal for a joint decision on a matter referred to in point (j), (l) or (o) of Article 16(7) of this Regulation, any of the voting members concerned, based on that majority, may refer that matter to ESMA in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. The resolution authority of the CCP shall await the decision taken by ESMA in accordance with Article 19(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and decide in accordance with the decision of ESMA.\nThe four-month period shall be deemed to be the conciliation phase within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. ESMA shall take its decision within one month of the referral of the matter to it. The matter shall not be referred to ESMA after the end of the four-month period or after a joint decision has been reached. In the absence of an ESMA decision within one month, the decision of the resolution authority shall apply.\nTITLE IV\nEARLY INTERVENTION\nArticle 18\nEarly intervention measures\n1.   Where a CCP infringes, or is likely to infringe in the near future, the capital and prudential requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, or poses a risk to financial stability in the Union or in one or more of its Member States, or where the competent authority has determined that there are other indications of an emerging crisis situation that could affect the operations of the CCP, in particular, its ability to provide clearing services, the competent authority may:\n(a)\nrequire the CCP to update the recovery plan in accordance with Article 9(6) of this Regulation, where the circumstances that required early intervention are different from the assumptions set out in the initial recovery plan;\n(b)\nrequire the CCP to implement one or more of the arrangements or measures set out in the recovery plan within a specific timeframe. Where the plan is updated pursuant to point (a), those arrangements or measures shall include any updated arrangements or measures;\n(c)\nrequire the CCP to identify the causes of the infringement or likely infringement as mentioned in paragraph 1 and draw up an action programme, including suitable measures and timeframes;\n(d)\nrequire the CCP to convene a meeting of its shareholders or, if the CCP fails to comply with that requirement, convene the meeting itself. In both cases the competent authority shall set the agenda, including the decisions to be considered for adoption by the shareholders;\n(e)\nrequire one or more members of the board or senior management to be removed or replaced where any of those persons is found unfit to perform their duties pursuant to Article 27 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;\n(f)\nrequire changes to the business strategy of the CCP;\n(g)\nrequire changes to the legal or operational structures of the CCP;\n(h)\nprovide the resolution authority with all the information necessary to update the CCP’s resolution plan in order to prepare for the possible resolution of the CCP and the valuation of its assets and liabilities in accordance with Article 24 of this Regulation, including any information acquired through on-site inspections;\n(i)\nrequire, where necessary and in accordance with paragraph 4, the implementation of the CCP’s recovery measures;\n(j)\nrequire the CCP to abstain from the implementation of certain recovery measures where the competent authority has determined that the implementation of those measures may have an adverse effect on financial stability in the Union or in one or more of its Member States;\n(k)\nrequire the CCP to replenish its financial resources in a timely manner in order to comply or maintain compliance with its capital and prudential requirements;\n(l)\nrequire the CCP to instruct clearing members to invite their clients to participate directly in auctions organised by the CCP when the nature of the auction justifies this exceptional participation. Clearing members shall inform their clients comprehensively about the auction following the instructions received from the CCP. In particular, the CCP shall specify the deadline after which it will not be possible to participate in the auction. Clients shall directly inform the CCP before this deadline of their willingness to participate in the auction. The CCP shall then facilitate the bidding process for those clients. A client shall only be authorised to participate in the auction if it is able to demonstrate to the CCP that it has set up the appropriate contractual relationship with a clearing member to execute and clear the transactions that may result from the auction;\n(m)\nrestrict or prohibit any remuneration of equity and instruments treated as equity to the fullest extent possible without triggering an event of default, including dividend payments and buybacks by the CCP, and it may restrict, prohibit or freeze any payments of variable remuneration as defined by the CCP’s remuneration policy pursuant to Article 26(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, discretionary pension benefits or severance packages to senior management as defined in point 29 of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n2.   For each of the measures referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authority shall set an appropriate deadline and evaluate the effectiveness of those measures once they have been taken.\n3.   The competent authority shall only apply the measures in points (a) to (m) of paragraph 1 after taking account of the impact of those measures in other Member States where the CCP operates or provides services and after informing the relevant competent authorities, in particular where the CCP’s operations are critical or important for local financial markets, including the places in which clearing members, linked trading venues and FMIs are established.\n4.   The competent authority shall apply the measure in point (i) of paragraph 1 only where that measure is in the public interest and is necessary to achieve any of the following objectives:\n(a)\nto maintain the financial stability in the Union or in one or more of its Member States;\n(b)\nto maintain the continuity of the critical functions of the CCP and access to critical functions on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis;\n(c)\nto maintain or restore the financial resilience of the CCP.\nThe competent authority shall not apply the measure in point (i) of paragraph 1 in relation to measures involving the transfer of property, rights or liabilities of another CCP.\n5.   Where a CCP uses contributions to the default fund of the non-defaulting clearing members in accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, it shall inform the competent authority and the resolution authority without undue delay and explain whether that event reflects weaknesses or problems of that CCP.\n6.   Where the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 are met, the competent authority shall notify ESMA and the resolution authority and consult the supervisory college on the envisaged measures provided for in paragraph 1.\nFollowing those notifications and the consultation of the supervisory college, the competent authority shall decide whether to apply any of the measures provided for in paragraph 1. The competent authority shall notify the decision on the measures to be taken to the supervisory college, the resolution authority and ESMA.\n7.   The resolution authority, following the notification of the first subparagraph of paragraph 6 of this Article, may require the CCP to contact potential purchasers in order to prepare for its resolution, subject to the conditions laid down in Article 41 and the confidentiality provisions laid down in Article 73.\n8.   ESMA shall, by 12 February 2022, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 to promote the consistent application of the triggers for the use of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\nArticle 19\nRemoval of senior management and board\n1.   Where there is a significant deterioration in the financial situation of a CCP, or the CCP infringes its legal requirements, including its operating rules, and other measures taken in accordance with Article 18 are not sufficient to reverse that situation, competent authorities may require total or partial removal of the senior management or board of the CCP.\nWhere the competent authority requires complete or partial removal of the senior management or board of the CCP, it shall notify ESMA, the resolution authority and the supervisory college.\n2.   The appointment of the new senior management or board shall be done in accordance with Article 27 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and be subject to the approval or consent of the competent authority. Where the competent authority considers that replacement of the senior management or board as referred to in this Article is insufficient, it may appoint one or more temporary administrators to the CCP to replace or to temporarily work with the board and senior management of the CCP. Any temporary administrator shall have the qualifications, ability and knowledge required to carry out his or her functions and be free of any conflict of interests.\nArticle 20\nProvision of recompense to non-defaulting clearing members\n1.   Without prejudice to the responsibility of clearing members to take losses which go beyond the default waterfall, where a CCP in recovery caused by a non-default event has applied the arrangements and measures to reduce the value of any gains payable by the CCP to non-defaulting clearing members set out in its recovery plan, and as a result has not entered into resolution, the competent authority of the CCP may require the CCP to recompense the clearing members for their loss through cash payments or, where appropriate, may require the CCP to issue instruments recognising a claim on the future profits of the CCP. The possibility to provide recompense to non-defaulting clearing members shall not apply to their contractually committed losses in the default management or recovery phases.\nThe cash payments or the value of instruments recognising a claim on future profits of the CCP issued to each affected non-defaulting clearing member shall be proportionate to its loss in excess of its contractual commitments. The instruments recognising a claim on future profits of the CCP shall entitle the possessor to receive payments from the CCP on an annual basis until the loss has been recouped, if possible in full, subject to an appropriate maximum number of years from the date of issuance. If the non-defaulting clearing members have passed on the excess losses to their clients, the non-defaulting clearing members shall be obliged to pass the payments received by the CCP on to their clients, to the extent that the losses being recompensed are related to client positions. An appropriate maximum share of the CCP’s annual profits shall be used towards payments relating to those instruments.\n2.   ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the order in which recompense must be paid, the appropriate maximum number of years and the appropriate maximum share of the CCP’s annual profits referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 12 February 2022.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nTITLE V\nRESOLUTION\nCHAPTER I\nObjectives, conditions and general principles\nArticle 21\nResolution objectives\n1.   When applying the resolution tools and exercising the resolution powers, the resolution authority shall have regard to all the following resolution objectives, which are of equal significance and shall balance them as appropriate to the nature and circumstances of each case:\n(a)\nto ensure the continuity of the CCP’s critical functions, in particular:\n(i)\nthe timely settlement of the CCP’s obligations to its clearing members and, where applicable, their clients;\n(ii)\ncontinuous access of clearing members and, where applicable, their clients to securities or cash accounts provided by the CCP and collateral in the form of financial assets held by the CCP;\n(b)\nto ensure the continuity of the links with other FMIs which, if disrupted, would have a material negative impact on financial stability in the Union or in one or more of its Member States as well as the timely completion of payment, clearing, settlement and record-keeping functions;\n(c)\nto avoid a significant adverse effect on the financial system in the Union or in one or more of its Member States, in particular by preventing or mitigating contagion of financial distress to the CCP’s clearing members, their clients or to the wider financial system, including other FMIs, and by maintaining market discipline and public confidence; and\n(d)\nto protect public funds by minimising reliance on extraordinary public financial support and the potential risk of losses for taxpayers.\n2.   When pursuing the objectives set out in paragraph 1, the resolution authority shall seek to minimise the cost of resolution on all affected stakeholders and avoid destruction of the CCP’s value, unless such destruction is necessary to achieve the resolution objectives.\nArticle 22\nConditions for resolution\n1.   The resolution authority shall take a resolution action in relation to a CCP provided that all of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe CCP is failing or is likely to fail as determined by any of the following:\n(i)\nthe competent authority, after consulting the resolution authority;\n(ii)\nthe resolution authority after consulting the competent authority, where the resolution authority has the necessary tools for reaching that conclusion;\n(b)\nthere is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures, including the CCP’s recovery plan or other contractual arrangements, or supervisory action, including early intervention measures taken, would prevent the failure of the CCP within a reasonable timeframe, having regard to all relevant circumstances;\n(c)\na resolution action is necessary in the public interest to achieve, while being proportionate to, one or more of the resolution objectives, and winding up the CCP under normal insolvency procedures would not meet those resolution objectives to the same extent.\n2.   For the purposes of point (a)(ii) of paragraph 1, the competent authority shall provide the resolution authority on its own initiative and without delay with any information that may give an indication that the CCP is failing or likely to fail. The competent authority shall also provide the resolution authority upon request with any other information needed in order to perform its assessment.\n3.   For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 1, a CCP shall be deemed to be failing or likely to fail where one or more of the following circumstances apply:\n(a)\nthe CCP infringes, or is likely to infringe, its authorisation requirements in a way that would justify the withdrawal of its authorisation pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;\n(b)\nthe CCP is unable, or is likely to be unable, to provide a critical function;\n(c)\nthe CCP is unable, or is likely to be unable, to restore its viability through the implementation of its recovery measures;\n(d)\nthe CCP is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due;\n(e)\nthe CCP requires extraordinary public financial support.\n4.   For the purposes of point (e) of paragraph 3, public financial support shall not be considered extraordinary public financial support where it meets all of the following conditions:\n(a)\nit takes the form of a State guarantee to back liquidity facilities provided by a central bank according to the central bank’s conditions, or the form of a State guarantee of newly issued liabilities;\n(b)\nthe State guarantees referred to in point (a) of this paragraph are required to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State and preserve financial stability; and\n(c)\nthe State guarantees referred to in point (a) of this paragraph are confined to solvent CCPs, conditional on final approval under the Union State aid framework, are of a precautionary and temporary nature, proportionate to remedy the consequences of the serious disturbance referred to in point (b) of this paragraph and are not used to offset losses that the CCP has incurred or is likely to incur in the future.\n5.   The resolution authority may also take a resolution action where it considers that the CCP has applied or intends to apply recovery measures which could prevent the CCP’s failure but cause significant adverse effects to the financial system of the Union or of one of more of its Member States.\n6.   ESMA shall issue guidelines to promote the convergence of supervisory and resolution practices regarding the application of the circumstances under which a CCP is deemed to be failing or likely to fail by 12 February 2022, taking into consideration, as appropriate, the nature, and complexity of the services provided by CCPs established in the Union.\nWhen developing those guidelines, ESMA shall take into account the guidelines issued in accordance with Article 32(6) of Directive 2014/59/EU.\nArticle 23\nGeneral principles regarding resolution\n1.   The resolution authority shall take all appropriate measures to apply the resolution tools referred to in Article 27 and exercise the resolution powers referred to in Article 48 in accordance with the following principles:\n(a)\nall contractual obligations and other arrangements in the CCP’s recovery plan are enforced, to the extent that they have not been exhausted before entry into resolution, unless the resolution authority determines that in order to achieve the resolution objectives in a timely manner any of the following or both are more appropriate:\n(i)\nto refrain from enforcing certain contractual obligations under the CCP’s recovery plan or otherwise deviate from it;\n(ii)\nto apply resolution tools or exercise the resolution powers;\n(b)\nthe shareholders of the CCP under resolution bear first losses following the enforcement of all obligations and arrangements referred to in point (a) and in accordance with that point;\n(c)\ncreditors of the CCP under resolution bear losses after the shareholders in accordance with the order of priority of their claims under normal insolvency proceedings, unless expressly provided otherwise in this Regulation;\n(d)\nthe CCP’s creditors of the same class are treated in an equitable manner;\n(e)\nthe CCP’s shareholders, clearing members and other creditors should not incur greater losses than they would have incurred in the circumstances referred to in Article 60;\n(f)\nthe board and senior management of the CCP under resolution are replaced, except where the resolution authority considers that the retention of the board and senior management, in whole or in part, is necessary for the achievement of the resolution objectives;\n(g)\nresolution authorities inform and consult employee representatives in accordance with their national laws, collective agreements or practice;\n(h)\nresolution tools are applied and resolution powers are exercised without prejudice to provisions on the representation of employees in management bodies as provided for in national laws, collective agreements or practice; and\n(i)\nwhere a CCP is part of a group, resolution authorities take account of the impact on other group entities, in particular where such group comprises other FMIs, and on the group as a whole.\n2.   Resolution authorities may take a resolution action which deviates from the principles set out in points (d) or (e) of paragraph 1 of this Article where it is justified in the public interest to achieve the resolution objectives and is proportionate to the risk addressed. However, where that deviation results in a shareholder, a clearing member or any other creditor incurring greater losses than it would have incurred in the circumstances referred to in Article 60, the entitlement to payment of the difference under Article 62 shall apply.\n3.   The board and senior management of a CCP under resolution shall provide the resolution authority with all necessary assistance for the achievement of the resolution objectives.\nCHAPTER II\nValuation\nArticle 24\nObjectives of valuation\n1.   Resolution authorities shall ensure that any resolution action is taken on the basis of a valuation ensuring a fair, prudent and realistic assessment of the assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of the CCP.\n2.   Before the resolution authority places a CCP under resolution, it shall ensure that a first valuation is carried out to determine whether the conditions for resolution under Article 22(1) are met.\n3.   After the resolution authority has decided to place a CCP under resolution, it shall ensure that a second valuation is carried out to:\n(a)\ninform the decision on the appropriate resolution action to be taken;\n(b)\nensure that any losses on the assets and rights of the CCP are fully recognised at the moment the resolution tools are applied;\n(c)\ninform the decision on the extent of the cancellation or dilution of instruments of ownership and the decision on the value and number of instruments of ownership issued or transferred as a result of the exercise of resolution powers;\n(d)\ninform the decision on the extent of the write-down or conversion of any unsecured liabilities, including debt instruments;\n(e)\nwhere the loss and position allocation tools are applied, inform the decision on the extent of losses to be applied against affected creditors’ claims, outstanding obligations or positions in relation to the CCP and on the extent and necessity of a resolution cash call;\n(f)\nwhere the bridge CCP tool is applied, inform the decision on the assets, liabilities, rights and obligations or instruments of ownership that may be transferred to the bridge CCP and the decision on the value of any consideration that may be paid to the CCP under resolution or, where relevant, to the holders of the instruments of ownership;\n(g)\nwhere the sale of business tool is applied, inform the decision on the assets, liabilities, rights and obligations or instruments of ownership that may be transferred to the third party purchaser and to inform the resolution authority’s understanding of what constitutes commercial terms for the purposes of Article 40.\nFor the purposes of point (d), the valuation shall take into account any losses that would be absorbed by the enforcement of any outstanding obligations of the clearing members or other third parties owed to the CCP and the level of conversion to be applied to debt instruments.\n4.   The valuations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article may be subject to an appeal in accordance with Article 74 only together with the decision to apply a resolution tool or to exercise a resolution power.\nArticle 25\nRequirements for valuation\n1.   The resolution authority shall ensure that the valuations referred to in Article 24 are carried out:\n(a)\nby a person independent from any public authority and from the CCP; or\n(b)\nby the resolution authority, where those valuations cannot be carried out by a person as referred to in point (a).\n2.   The valuations referred to in Article 24 shall be considered definitive where they are carried out by the person referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article and all the requirements laid down in this Article are fulfilled.\n3.   Without prejudice to the Union State aid framework, where applicable, a definitive valuation shall be based on prudent assumptions and shall not assume any potential provision of extraordinary public financial support, any central bank emergency liquidity assistance or any central bank liquidity assistance provided under non-standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms to the CCP from the point in time at which resolution action is taken. The valuation shall also take account of the potential recovery of any reasonable expenses incurred by the CCP under resolution in accordance with Article 27(10).\n4.   A definitive valuation shall be supplemented by the following information held by the CCP:\n(a)\nan updated balance sheet and a report on the financial position of the CCP, including the remaining available pre-funded resources and outstanding financial commitments;\n(b)\nthe records of cleared contracts referred to in Article 29 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012; and\n(c)\nany information on the market and accounting values of its assets, liabilities and positions, including relevant claims and outstanding obligations owed or due to the CCP.\n5.   A definitive valuation shall indicate the subdivision of the creditors in classes in accordance with their priority levels under the applicable insolvency law. It shall also include an estimate of the treatment that each class of shareholders and creditors would have been expected to receive in application of the principle specified in point (e) of Article 23(1).\nThe estimate referred to in the first subparagraph shall not prejudice the valuation referred to in Article 61.\n6.   ESMA, taking into account the regulatory technical standards developed in accordance with Article 36(14) and (15) of Directive 2014/59/EU and adopted pursuant to Article 36(16) thereof, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a)\nthe circumstances in which a person is deemed to be independent from both the resolution authority and from the CCP for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article;\n(b)\nthe methodology for assessing the value of the assets and liabilities of the CCP; and\n(c)\nthe separation of the valuations under Articles 24 and 61 of this Regulation.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 12 February 2022.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 26\nProvisional valuation\n1.   The valuations referred to in Article 24 that do not meet the requirements laid down in Article 25(2) shall be considered to be provisional valuations.\nProvisional valuations shall include a buffer for additional losses and an appropriate justification for that buffer.\n2.   Where resolution authorities take resolution action on the basis of a provisional valuation, they shall ensure that a definitive valuation is carried out as soon as practicable.\nThe resolution authority shall ensure that the definitive valuation referred to in the first subparagraph:\n(a)\nallows for full recognition of any losses of the CCP in its books;\n(b)\ninforms a decision to write back creditors’ claims or to increase the value of the consideration paid, in accordance with paragraph 3.\n3.   Where the definitive valuation’s estimate of the net asset value of the CCP is higher than the provisional valuation’s estimate of the net asset value of the CCP, the resolution authority may:\n(a)\nincrease the value of the claims of affected creditors which have been written down or restructured;\n(b)\nrequire a bridge CCP to make a further payment of consideration in respect of the assets, liabilities, rights and obligations to the CCP under resolution or, as the case may be, in respect of the instruments of ownership to the owners of those instruments.\n4.   ESMA, taking into account the regulatory technical standards developed in accordance with Article 36(15) of Directive 2014/59/EU and adopted pursuant to Article 36(16) thereof, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify, for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the methodology for calculating the buffer for additional losses to be included in provisional valuations.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 12 February 2022.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nCHAPTER III\nResolution tools\nSection 1\nGeneral principles\nArticle 27\nGeneral provisions on resolution tools\n1.   Resolution authorities shall take resolution actions referred to in Article 21 by applying any of the following resolution tools individually or in any combination:\n(a)\nthe position and loss allocation tools;\n(b)\nthe write-down and conversion tool;\n(c)\nthe sale of business tool;\n(d)\nthe bridge CCP tool.\n2.   In the event of a systemic crisis, a Member State may as a last resort provide extraordinary public financial support by applying government stabilisation tools in accordance with Articles 45, 46 and 47 on the condition of prior and final approval under the Union State aid framework and where credible arrangements for the timely and comprehensive recovery of the funds in accordance with paragraph 10 of this Article are provided for.\n3.   Prior to the application of the tools referred to in paragraph 1, the resolution authority shall enforce:\n(a)\nany existing and outstanding rights of the CCP, including any contractual obligations by clearing members to meet recovery cash calls, to provide additional resources to the CCP, or to take on positions of defaulting clearing members, whether through an auction or other agreed means in the CCP’s operating rules;\n(b)\nany existing and outstanding contractual obligation committing parties other than clearing members to any forms of financial support.\nThe resolution authority may partially enforce the contractual obligations referred to in points (a) and (b) where it is not possible to enforce those contractual obligations in full within a reasonable timeframe.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, the resolution authority may refrain from enforcing the relevant existing and outstanding obligations either partially or in full to avoid significant adverse effects on the financial system or widespread contagion, or where the application of the tools referred to in paragraph 1 is more appropriate in order to achieve the resolution objectives in a timely manner.\n5.   In the event that the resolution authority refrains partially or fully from enforcing existing and outstanding obligations as set out in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3 or in paragraph 4 of this Article, the resolution authority may enforce the remaining obligations within 18 months after the CCP is considered to be failing or likely to fail in accordance with Article 22, provided that the reasons for refraining from enforcing those obligations no longer exist. The resolution authority shall notify the clearing member and other party three to six months before enforcing the remaining obligation. The proceeds from the enforced remaining obligations shall be used to recover the use of public funds.\nThe resolution authority shall, after consultation with the competent authorities and resolution authorities of the affected clearing members and any other parties committed by existing and outstanding obligations, determine whether the reasons for refraining from enforcing the existing and outstanding obligations have ceased to exist and whether to enforce remaining obligations. Where the resolution authority deviates from the views expressed by the authorities consulted, it shall provide duly justified reasons, in writing, for doing so.\nThe requirement to meet the remaining obligations in the circumstances referred to in this paragraph shall be included in the CCP’s rules and other contractual arrangements.\n6.   The resolution authority may require the CCP to compensate non-defaulting clearing members for their losses stemming from the application of loss allocation tools, where those losses are in excess of the losses that the non-defaulting clearing member would have borne under their obligations under the CCP’s operating rules, provided that the non-defaulting clearing member would have been entitled to the payment of the difference referred to in Article 62.\nThe compensation referred to in the first subparagraph may take the form of instruments of ownership, debt instruments or instruments recognising a claim on the CCP’s future profits.\nThe amount of instruments issued to each affected non-defaulting clearing member shall be proportionate to the excess loss referred to in the first subparagraph. It shall take account of any outstanding contractual obligations of the clearing members toward the CCP and be deducted from any entitlement to the payment of the difference referred to in Article 62.\nThe amount of instruments shall be based on the valuation conducted in accordance with Article 24(3).\n7.   Where one of the government stabilisation tools is applied, the resolution authority shall exercise the power to write down and convert any instruments of ownership and debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities before or together with the application of the government stabilisation tool.\nWhere the application of a resolution tool other than the write-down and conversion tool results in financial losses being borne by clearing members, the resolution authority shall exercise the power to write down and convert any instruments of ownership and debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities immediately before or together with the application of the resolution tool, unless applying a different sequence would minimise deviations from the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle set out in Article 60 and better achieve the resolution objectives.\n8.   Where only the resolution tools referred to in points (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article are applied, and only part of the assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of the CCP under resolution are transferred in accordance with Articles 40 and 42, the residual part of that CCP shall be wound up in accordance with normal insolvency proceedings.\n9.   National insolvency law rules relating to the voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to creditors shall not apply to transfers of assets, rights, obligations or liabilities from a CCP in relation to which resolution tools or government financial stabilisation tools are applied.\n10.   Member States shall recover over an appropriate period any public funds used as government financial stabilisation tools as referred to in Section 7 of this Chapter and resolution authorities shall recover any reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with the application of the resolution tools or powers. Such recovery shall, inter alia, come from:\n(a)\nthe CCP under resolution, as a preferred creditor, including any of its claims against defaulting clearing members;\n(b)\nany consideration paid by the purchaser to the CCP, as a preferred creditor prior to the application of Article 40(4), where the sale of business tool has been applied;\n(c)\nany proceeds generated as a result of the termination of the bridge CCP, as a preferred creditor prior to the application of Article 42(5);\n(d)\nany proceeds generated by the application of the public equity support tool referred to in Article 46 and the temporary public ownership tool referred to in Article 47, including the proceeds generated from their sale.\n11.   When applying the resolution tools, resolution authorities shall ensure, on the basis of a valuation that complies with Article 25, the restoration of a matched book, the full allocation of losses, the replenishment of the pre-funded resources of the CCP or the bridge CCP, and the recapitalisation of the CCP or the bridge CCP.\nResolution authorities shall ensure the replenishment of the pre-funded resources and the recapitalisation of the CCP or the bridge CCP as referred to in the first subparagraph, to an extent sufficient to restore the ability of the CCP or the bridge CCP to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to continue to carry out the critical functions of the CCP or the bridge CCP, taking into account the operating rules of the CCP or the bridge CCP.\nNotwithstanding the application of other resolution tools, resolution authorities may apply the tools referred to in Articles 30 and 31 to recapitalise the CCP.\nSection 2\nPosition allocation and loss allocation tools\nArticle 28\nObjective and scope of the position and loss allocation tools\n1.   Resolution authorities shall apply the position allocation tool in accordance with Article 29 and the loss allocation tools in accordance with Articles 30 and 31.\n2.   Resolution authorities shall apply the tools referred to in paragraph 1 in respect of contracts relating to clearing services and the collateral related to those services posted to the CCP.\n3.   Resolution authorities shall apply the position allocation tool referred to in Article 29 in order to rematch the book of the CCP or bridge CCP where relevant.\nResolution authorities shall apply the loss allocation tools referred to in Articles 30 and 31 for any of the following purposes:\n(a)\nto cover the losses of the CCP assessed in accordance with Article 25;\n(b)\nto restore the ability of the CCP to meet payment obligations as they fall due;\n(c)\nto achieve the outcome referred to in points (a) and (b) in relation to a bridge CCP;\n(d)\nto support the transfer of the CCP’s business by way of the sale of business tool to a solvent third party.\nThe loss allocation tool referred to in Article 30 may be applied by the resolution authorities in relation to losses arising from a default event and in relation to losses arising from a non-default event. If the loss allocation tool referred to in Article 30 is applied in relation to losses arising from a non-default event, it shall only be applied up to a cumulative amount equivalent to the non-defaulting clearing members’ contribution to the CCP’s default funds and distributed among clearing members proportionally to their contributions to the default funds.\n4.   Resolution authorities shall not apply the loss allocation tools referred to in Articles 30 and 31 of this Regulation with regard to the entities referred to in Articles 1(4) and 1(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\nArticle 29\nTermination of contracts – partial or full\n1.   The resolution authority may terminate some or all of the following contracts of the CCP under resolution:\n(a)\nthe contracts with the clearing member in default;\n(b)\nthe contracts of the affected clearing service or asset class;\n(c)\nthe other contracts of the CCP under resolution.\nThe resolution authority shall terminate the contracts referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph only where the transfer of the assets and positions resulting from those contracts has not taken place within the meaning of Article 48(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\nWhen using the power under the first subparagraph, the resolution authority shall terminate contracts referred to under each of points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph in a similar way, without discriminating between counterparties to those contracts, with the exception of those contractual obligations that cannot be enforced in a reasonable timeframe.\n2.   The resolution authority shall give notice to all relevant clearing members of the date on which any contract referred to in paragraph 1 is terminated.\n3.   Prior to the termination of any of the contracts referred to in paragraph 1, the resolution authority shall take the following steps:\n(a)\nrequire the CCP under resolution to value each contract, and update the account balances of each clearing member;\n(b)\ndetermine the net amount payable by or to each clearing member, taking account of any due but unpaid variation margin, including variation margin due as a result of the contract valuations referred to in point (a); and\n(c)\nnotify each clearing member of the determined net amounts and require the CCP to pay or collect them accordingly.\nThe clearing members shall, without undue delay, communicate the application of such tool to their clients and the way in which such application affects them.\n4.   The valuation referred in point (a) of paragraph 3 shall be based, as far as possible, on a fair market price determined on the basis of the CCP’s own rules and arrangements, unless the resolution authority deems necessary the use of another appropriate price discovery method.\n5.   Where a non-defaulting clearing member is unable to pay the net amount determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, the resolution authority may, having regard to Article 21 of this Regulation, require the CCP to place the non-defaulting clearing member in default and use its initial margin and default fund contribution in accordance with Article 45 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n6.   Where the resolution authority has terminated one or more contracts of the types referred to in paragraph 1, it may temporarily prevent the CCP from clearing any new contract of the same type as the one terminated.\nThe resolution authority may allow the CCP to resume the clearing of those types of contracts only where the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe CCP complies with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012; and\n(b)\nthe resolution authority issues and publishes a notice to that effect using the means referred to in Article 72(3).\n7.   ESMA shall by 12 February 2022 issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 further specifying the methodology to be used by the resolution authority for determining the valuation referred in point (a) of paragraph 3 of this Article.\nArticle 30\nReduction of the value of any gains payable by the CCP to non-defaulting clearing members\n1.   The resolution authority may reduce the amount of the CCP’s payment obligations to non-defaulting clearing members where those obligations arise from gains due in accordance with the CCP’s processes for paying variation margin or a payment that has the same economic effect.\n2.   The resolution authority shall calculate any reduction in payment obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article using an equitable allocation mechanism determined in the valuation conducted in accordance with Article 24(3) and communicated to the clearing members as soon as the resolution tool is applied. The clearing members shall, without undue delay, communicate the application of such tool to their clients and the way in which such application affects them. The total net gains to be reduced for each clearing member shall be proportional to the amounts due from the CCP.\n3.   The reduction in the value of gains payable shall take effect and shall be immediately binding on the CCP and affected clearing members from the moment at which the resolution authority takes the resolution action.\n4.   A non-defaulting clearing member shall not have any claim in any subsequent proceedings against the CCP, or its successor entity, arising from the reduction in payment obligations referred to in paragraph 1.\nThe first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not prevent resolution authorities from requiring the CCP to reimburse clearing members, where the level of reduction based on the provisional valuation referred to in Article 26(1) is found to exceed the level of reduction required based on the definitive valuation referred to in Article 26(2).\n5.   Where a resolution authority reduces only in part the value of gains payable, the residual outstanding payable amount shall still be owed to the non-defaulting clearing member.\n6.   The CCP shall include in its operating rules reference to the power to reduce payment obligations referred to in paragraph 1 in addition to any similar arrangements provided for in those operating rules at the recovery stage and shall ensure that contractual arrangements are concluded to allow the resolution authority to exercise its powers under this Article.\nArticle 31\nResolution cash call\n1.   The resolution authority may require non-defaulting clearing members to make a contribution in cash to the CCP up to twice the amount equivalent to their contribution to the CCP’s default fund. This obligation to make a contribution in cash shall also be included in the CCP’s rules and other contractual arrangements as a resolution cash call reserved to the resolution authority taking resolution action. Where the resolution authority calls for an amount in excess of the contribution to the default fund, it shall do so after assessing the impact of this tool on non-defaulting clearing members and the financial stability of Member States, in cooperation with the resolution authorities of non-defaulting clearing members.\nWhere the CCP operates multiple default funds and the tool is applied to address a default event, the amount of the contribution in cash referred to in the first subparagraph shall refer to the contribution of the clearing member to the default fund of the affected clearing service or asset class.\nWhere the CCP operates multiple default funds and the tool is applied to address a non-default event, the amount of the contribution in cash referred to in the first subparagraph shall refer to the sum of the contributions of the clearing member to all default funds of the CCP.\nThe resolution authority may exercise the resolution cash call regardless of whether all contractual obligations requiring cash contributions from non-defaulting clearing members have been exhausted.\nThe resolution authority shall determine the amount of the cash contribution of each non-defaulting clearing member in proportion to its contribution to the default fund up to the limit referred in the first subparagraph.\nThe resolution authority may require the CCP to reimburse clearing members the possible excess amount of a resolution cash call where the level of the resolution cash call applied based on a provisional valuation according to Article 26(1) is found to exceed the required level based on the definitive valuation referred to in Article 26(2).\n2.   If a non-defaulting clearing member does not pay the required amount, the resolution authority may require the CCP to place that clearing member in default and use its initial margin and default fund contribution in accordance with Article 45 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 up to the required amount.\nSection 3\nWrite-down and conversion of instruments of ownership and debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities\nArticle 32\nRequirement to write down and convert instruments of ownership and debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities\n1.   The resolution authority shall apply the write-down and conversion tool in accordance with Article 33 in respect of instruments of ownership and debt instruments issued by the CCP under resolution or other unsecured liabilities in order to absorb losses, recapitalise that CCP or a bridge CCP, or to support the application of the sale of business tool.\n2.   Based on the valuation carried out in accordance with Article 24(3), the resolution authority shall determine the following:\n(a)\nthe amount by which the instruments of ownership and debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities must be written down taking into account any losses that are to be absorbed by the enforcement of any outstanding obligations of the clearing members or other third parties owed to the CCP; and\n(b)\nthe amount by which debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities must be converted into instruments of ownership in order to restore the capital requirements of the CCP or the bridge CCP.\nArticle 33\nProvisions governing the write-down or conversion of instruments of ownership and debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities\n1.   The resolution authority shall apply the write-down and conversion tool in accordance with the priority of claims applicable under normal insolvency proceedings.\n2.   Prior to reducing or converting the principal amount of debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities, the resolution authority shall reduce the nominal amount of instruments of ownership in proportion to the losses and up to their full value, where necessary.\nWhere, in accordance with the valuation carried out pursuant to Article 24(3), the CCP maintains a positive net value after the reduction of the nominal amount of instruments of ownership, the resolution authority shall cancel or dilute, as the case may be, those instruments of ownership.\n3.   The resolution authority shall reduce, convert, or both, the principal amount of debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities to the extent required to achieve the resolution objectives, and up to the full value of those instruments or liabilities, where necessary.\n4.   The resolution authority shall not apply the write-down and conversion tool in respect of the following liabilities:\n(a)\nliabilities to employees, in relation to accrued salary, pension benefits or other fixed remuneration, except for any variable component of remuneration that is not regulated by a collective bargaining agreement;\n(b)\nliabilities to commercial or trade creditors arising from the provision to the CCP of goods or services that are critical to the daily functioning of its operations, including IT services, utilities and the rental, servicing and upkeep of premises;\n(c)\nliabilities to tax and social security authorities, provided that those liabilities are preferred liabilities under the applicable insolvency law;\n(d)\nliabilities owed to systems or operators of systems designated according to Directive 98/26/EC, to participants to the extent that the liabilities result from their participation in such systems, to other CCPs, and to central banks;\n(e)\ninitial margins.\n5.   Where the nominal amount of an instrument of ownership or the principal amount of a debt instrument or other unsecured liabilities is reduced, the following conditions shall apply:\n(a)\nthat reduction shall be permanent;\n(b)\nthe holder of the instrument shall have no claim in connection with that reduction, except for any liability already accrued, any liability for damages that may arise as a result of an appeal challenging the legality of that reduction, any claim based on instruments of ownership issued or transferred pursuant to paragraph 6 of this Article, or any claim for payment in accordance with Article 62; and\n(c)\nwhere that reduction is only partial, the agreement that created the original liability shall continue to apply in respect of the residual amount subject to any necessary amendments of the terms of that agreement due to the reduction.\nPoint (a) of the first subparagraph shall not prevent resolution authorities from applying a write-up mechanism to reimburse holders of debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities and then holders of instruments of ownership, where the level of write-down applied based on the provisional valuation referred to in Article 26(1) is found to exceed the amounts required based on the definitive valuation referred to in Article 26(2).\n6.   Where converting debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities pursuant to paragraph 3, the resolution authority may require the CCP to issue or to transfer instruments of ownership to the holders of the debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities.\n7.   The resolution authority shall only convert debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities pursuant to paragraph 3 where the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe instruments of ownership are issued prior to any issuance of instruments of ownership by the CCP for the purposes of provision of own funds by the State or a government entity; and\n(b)\nthe conversion rate represents appropriate compensation to the affected debt holders for any loss incurred as a result of the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers, in line with their treatment under normal insolvency proceedings.\nFollowing any conversion of debt instruments or other unsecured liabilities to instruments of ownership, the latter shall be subscribed or transferred without delay after the conversion.\n8.   For the purposes of paragraph 7, the resolution authority shall ensure, in the context of drawing up and maintaining the CCP’s resolution plan and as part of the powers to remove impediments to the resolvability of the CCP, that the CCP is at all times able to issue the necessary number of instruments of ownership.\nArticle 34\nEffect of write-down and conversion\nThe resolution authority shall complete or require the completion of all the administrative and procedural tasks necessary to give effect to the application of the write-down and conversion tool, including:\n(a)\nthe amendment of all relevant registers;\n(b)\nthe delisting or removal from trading of instruments of ownership or debt instruments;\n(c)\nthe listing or admission to trading of new instruments of ownership; and\n(d)\nthe relisting or readmission of any debt instruments which have been written down, without the requirement for the issuing of a prospectus in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24).\nArticle 35\nRemoval of procedural obstacles for write-down and conversion\n1.   Where Article 32(1) is applied, the competent authority shall require the CCP to maintain at all times a sufficient amount of instruments of ownership to ensure that the CCP may issue sufficient new instruments of ownership and that the issuance of or conversion into instruments of ownership could be carried out effectively.\n2.   The resolution authority shall apply the write-down and conversion tool regardless of any provisions in the CCP’s instruments of incorporation or statutes, including with respect to pre-emption rights for shareholders or requirements for the consent of shareholders to an increase of capital.\nArticle 36\nSubmission of a business reorganisation plan\n1.   CCPs shall, within one month after the application of the tools referred to in Article 32, conduct a review of the causes of its failure and submit it to the resolution authority alongside a business reorganisation plan in accordance with Article 37. Where the Union State aid framework is applicable, that plan, including following any amendments in accordance with Article 38 and as implemented in accordance with Article 39, shall be compatible with the restructuring plan that the CCP is required to submit to the Commission in accordance with that framework.\nWhere necessary for achieving the resolution objectives, the resolution authority may extend the period referred to in the first subparagraph up to a maximum of two months.\n2.   Where a restructuring plan is required to be notified under the Union State aid framework, the submission of the business reorganisation plan shall be without prejudice to the deadline laid down by that framework for the submission of that restructuring plan.\n3.   The resolution authority shall submit the review and the business reorganisation plan, and any revised plan in accordance with Article 38, to the competent authority and to the resolution college.\nArticle 37\nContent of the business reorganisation plan\n1.   The business reorganisation plan referred to in Article 36 shall set out measures aiming to restore the long-term viability of the CCP or parts of its business within a reasonable timeframe. Those measures shall be based on realistic assumptions as to the economic and financial market conditions under which the CCP will operate.\nThe business reorganisation plan shall take account of the current and potential states of the financial markets and reflect best-case and worst-case assumptions, including a combination of events to identify the CCP’s main vulnerabilities. Assumptions shall be compared with appropriate sector-wide benchmarks.\n2.   The business reorganisation plan shall include at least the following elements:\n(a)\na detailed analysis of the factors and circumstances that caused the CCP to fail or to be likely to fail;\n(b)\na description of the measures to be adopted to restore the CCP’s long-term viability; and\n(c)\na timetable for the implementation of those measures.\n3.   Measures aiming to restore the long-term viability of a CCP may include:\n(a)\nthe reorganisation and restructuring of the activities of the CCP;\n(b)\nchanges to the CCP’s operational systems and infrastructure;\n(c)\nthe sale of assets or of business lines;\n(d)\nchanges to the CCP’s risk management.\n4.   ESMA shall by 12 February 2023 develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the minimum elements that should be included in a business reorganisation plan pursuant to paragraph 2.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 38\nAssessment and adoption of the business reorganisation plan\n1.   Within one month of the submission of the business reorganisation plan by the CCP pursuant to Article 36(1), the resolution authority and the competent authority shall assess whether the measures provided for in that plan would reliably restore the long-term viability of the CCP.\nWhere the resolution authority and the competent authority are satisfied that the plan would restore the CCP’s long-term viability, the resolution authority shall approve the plan.\n2.   Where the resolution authority or the competent authority are not satisfied that the measures provided for in the plan would restore the CCP’s long-term viability, the resolution authority shall notify the CCP of their concerns and require it to resubmit an amended plan addressing those concerns within two weeks of the notification.\n3.   The resolution authority and the competent authority shall assess the resubmitted plan and the resolution authority shall notify the CCP within one week of the reception of that plan whether the concerns are appropriately addressed or whether further amendments are required.\n4.   ESMA shall by 12 February 2023 develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria that a business reorganisation plan is to fulfil for approval by the resolution authority pursuant to paragraph 1.\nThe Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 39\nImplementation and monitoring of the business reorganisation plan\n1.   The CCP shall implement the business reorganisation plan and shall submit a report to the resolution authority and the competent authority as requested and, at least, every six months on its progress in implementing that plan.\n2.   The resolution authority, in agreement with the competent authority, may require the CCP to revise the plan where necessary to achieve the aim referred to in Article 37(1).\nSection 4\nSale of business tool\nArticle 40\nSale of business tool\n1.   The resolution authority may transfer the following to a purchaser that is not a bridge CCP:\n(a)\ninstruments of ownership issued by a CCP under resolution;\n(b)\nany assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of a CCP under resolution.\nThe transfer referred to in the first subparagraph shall take place without obtaining the consent of the shareholders of the CCP, or any third party other than the purchaser and without complying with any procedural requirements under company or securities law other than those provided for in Article 41.\n2.   A transfer made pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be made on commercial terms, having regard to the circumstances, and in accordance with the Union State aid framework.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the resolution authority shall take all reasonable steps to obtain commercial terms that conform to the valuation conducted under Article 24(3).\n3.   Subject to Article 27(10), any consideration paid by the purchaser shall benefit:\n(a)\nthe owners of the instruments of ownership where the sale of business has been effected by transferring instruments of ownership issued by the CCP under resolution from the holders of those instruments to the purchaser;\n(b)\nthe CCP under resolution, where the sale of business has been effected by transferring some or all of the assets or liabilities of the CCP to the purchaser;\n(c)\nany non-defaulting clearing members that have suffered losses resulting from the application of the resolution tools in resolution, proportionate to their losses in resolution.\n4.

The resolution authority may exercise the transfer power referred to in paragraph 1 more than once in order to make supplemental transfers of instruments of ownership issued by the CCP or, as the case may be, the CCP’s assets, rights, obligations, or liabilities.\n6.   The resolution authority may, with the consent of the purchaser, transfer the assets, rights, obligations or liabilities that had been transferred to the purchaser back to the CCP under resolution, or the instruments of ownership back to their original owners.\nWhere the resolution authority uses the transfer power referred to in the first subparagraph, the CCP under resolution or original owners shall be obliged to take back any such assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, or instruments of ownership.\n7.   Any transfer made pursuant to paragraph 1 shall take place irrespective of whether the purchaser is authorised to provide the services and carry out the activities resulting from the acquisition.\nWhere the purchaser is not authorised to provide the services and carry out the activities resulting from the acquisition, the resolution authority, in consultation with the competent authority, shall conduct an appropriate due diligence assessment of the purchaser and ensure that the purchaser has the professional and technical capacity to perform the functions of the purchased CCP and that it applies for authorisation as soon as practicable and, at the latest, within one month of the application of the sale of business tool. The competent authority shall ensure that any such application for authorisation is considered in an expedited manner.\n8.   Where the transfer of instruments of ownership referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article results in the acquisition of or increase in a qualifying holding referred to in Article 31(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the competent authority shall carry out the assessment referred to in that Article within a period that neither delays the application of the sale of business tool nor prevents the resolution action from achieving the relevant resolution objectives.\n9.   Where the competent authority has not completed the assessment referred to in paragraph 8 by the date on which the transfer of instruments of ownership takes effect, the following shall apply:\n(a)\nthe transfer of instruments of ownership shall have immediate legal effect from the date on which they are transferred;\n(b)\nduring the assessment period and during any divestment period provided for in point (f) of this paragraph, the purchaser’s voting rights attached to those instruments of ownership shall be suspended and vested solely in the resolution authority, which shall have no obligation to exercise them and, unless the act or omission implies gross negligence or serious misconduct, shall not be liable for exercising or refraining from exercising them;\n(c)\nduring the assessment period and during any divestment period provided for in point (f) of this paragraph, any penalties provided for in Article 22(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 or measures for infringing the requirements for acquisitions or disposals of qualifying holdings provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 shall not apply to that transfer;\n(d)\nthe competent authority shall notify the resolution authority and the purchaser in writing of the result of its assessment in accordance with Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 promptly after completing its assessment;\n(e)\nwhere the competent authority does not oppose the transfer, the voting rights attached to those instruments of ownership shall be deemed to be fully vested in the purchaser as from the notification referred to in point (d) of this paragraph;\n(f)\nwhere the competent authority opposes the transfer of instruments of ownership, point (b) shall continue to apply and the resolution authority may, having taken into account market conditions, establish a divestment period within which the purchaser shall divest such instruments of ownership.\n10.   For the purposes of exercising its right to provide services in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the purchaser shall be considered to be a continuation of the CCP under resolution, and may continue to exercise any such right that was exercised by the CCP under resolution in respect of the assets, rights, obligations or liabilities transferred.\n11.   The purchaser referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be prevented from exercising the CCP’s rights of membership and accessing the payment and settlement systems and other linked FMIs and trading venues provided that the purchaser meets the criteria for membership or participation in those systems or infrastructures or trading venues.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, the purchaser shall not be denied access to payment and settlement systems, and other linked FMIs and trading venues, on the ground that the purchaser does not possess a rating from a credit rating agency, or that that rating is below the rating levels required to be granted access to those systems or infrastructures or trading venues.\nWhere the purchaser does not meet the criteria referred to in the first subparagraph, the purchaser may continue to exercise the CCP’s rights of membership and accessing those systems and other infrastructures and trading venues for the period specified by the resolution authority. That period shall not exceed 12 months.\n12.   Unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation, shareholders, creditors, clearing members and clients of the CCP under resolution and other third parties whose assets, rights, obligations or liabilities are not transferred shall have no rights over, or in relation to, the assets, rights, obligations or liabilities transferred.\nArticle 41\nSale of business tool: procedural requirements\n1.   Where applying the sale of business tool in relation to a CCP, the resolution authority shall advertise the availability, or make arrangements for the marketing, of the assets, rights, obligations, liabilities, or the instruments of ownership intended to be transferred. Pools of rights, assets, obligations and liabilities may be marketed separately.\n2.   Without prejudice to the Union State aid framework, where applicable, the marketing referred to in paragraph 1 shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria:\n(a)\nit shall be as transparent as possible and not materially misrepresent the assets, rights, obligations, liabilities, or instruments of ownership of the CCP, having regard to the circumstances and in particular the need to maintain financial stability;\n(b)\nit shall not unduly favour or discriminate between potential purchasers;\n(c)\nit shall be free from any conflict of interest;\n(d)\nit shall take account of the need to effect a rapid resolution action; and\n(e)\nit shall aim to maximise, as far as possible, the sale price for the instruments of ownership, assets, rights, obligations or liabilities involved.\nThe criteria referred to in the first subparagraph shall not prevent the resolution authority from soliciting particular potential purchasers.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, the resolution authority may apply the sale of business tool without complying with the requirement to market, or may market the assets, rights, obligations, liabilities or the instruments of ownership where it determines that compliance with that requirement or with those criteria would be likely to undermine one or more of the resolution objectives, including by creating a material threat to financial stability.\nSection 5\nBridge CCP tool\nArticle 42\nBridge CCP tool\n1.   The resolution authority may transfer to a bridge CCP the following:\n(a)\ninstruments of ownership issued by a CCP under resolution;\n(b)\nany assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of the CCP under resolution.\nThe transfer referred to in the first subparagraph may take place without obtaining the consent of the shareholders of the CCP under resolution or any third party other than the bridge CCP and without complying with any procedural requirements under company or securities law other than those provided for in Article 43.\n2.

The allocation of any consideration paid by the bridge CCP in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article shall be carried out as follows:\n(a)\nupon the occurrence of an event covered by the CCP’s default waterfall as set out in Articles 43 and 45 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, in a reversal of the order in which the losses have been imposed by the CCP’s default waterfall; or\n(b)\nupon the occurrence of an event not covered by the CCP’s default waterfall as set out in Articles 43 and 45 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, in a reversal of the order in which the losses were allocated in accordance with any applicable rules of the CCP.\nThe allocation of any remaining consideration shall be carried out in accordance with the priority of claims under normal insolvency proceedings.\n6.   The resolution authority may exercise the transfer power referred to in paragraph 1 more than once in order to make supplemental transfers of instruments of ownership issued by a CCP or of its assets, rights, obligations or liabilities.\n7.   The resolution authority may transfer the rights, obligations, assets or liabilities that had been transferred to the bridge CCP back to the CCP under resolution, or the instruments of ownership back to their original owners where that transfer is expressly provided for in the instrument by which the transfer referred to in paragraph 1 is made.\nWhere the resolution authority uses the transfer power referred to in the first subparagraph, the CCP under resolution or original owners shall be obliged to take back any such assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, or instruments of ownership, provided that the conditions in the first subparagraph of this paragraph or in paragraph 8 are met.\n8.   Where the specific instruments of ownership, assets, rights, obligations or liabilities do not fall within the classes of, or meet the conditions for transfer of, instruments of ownership, assets, rights, obligations or liabilities specified in the instrument by which the transfer was made, the resolution authority may transfer them from the bridge CCP back to the CCP under resolution or the original owners.\n9.

The bridge CCP shall not be prevented from exercising the CCP’s rights of membership and accessing payment and settlement systems and other linked FMIs and trading venues, provided that it meets the criteria for membership and participation in those systems or FMIs or trading venues.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, the bridge CCP shall not be denied access to payment and settlement systems and other FMIs and trading venues on the ground that the bridge CCP does not possess a rating from a credit rating agency, or that that rating is below the rating levels required to be granted access to those systems or infrastructures or trading venues.\nWhere the bridge CCP does not meet the criteria referred to in the first subparagraph, the bridge CCP may continue to exercise the CCP’s rights of membership and accessing those systems and other infrastructures and trading venues for a period specified by the resolution authority. That period shall not exceed 12 months.\n13.   Shareholders, creditors, clearing members and clients of the CCP under resolution and other third parties whose assets, rights, obligations or liabilities are not transferred to the bridge CCP, shall have no rights over, or in relation to, the assets, rights, obligations or liabilities transferred to the bridge CCP, or against its board or senior management.\n14.   The bridge CCP shall have no duty or responsibility to shareholders or creditors of the CCP under resolution, and the board or senior management of the bridge CCP shall have no liability to those shareholders or creditors for acts and omissions in the discharge of their duties, unless the act or omission is due to gross negligence or serious misconduct in accordance with applicable national law.\nArticle 43\nBridge CCP: procedural requirements\n1.

To that end, the resolution authority shall submit a request for such authorisation to the competent authority. If the competent authority decides to grant such authorisation, it shall indicate the period for which the bridge CCP’s obligation to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 is waived. That period shall not exceed 12 months. During that period, the bridge CCP shall be considered as a qualifying CCP as defined in point (88) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for the purposes of that Regulation.\nNotwithstanding the period referred to in the second subparagraph, in the case of prudential requirements under Chapter 3 of Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the waiver shall only be for a period of up to three months.

Public financial support may be provided for the recapitalisation of a CCP in exchange for instruments of ownership.\n2.

counterparties\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt lays down rules and procedures for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs)*.\nThese are designed to ensure CCPs have measures to recover from financial distress or can continue their main tasks if they are failing, or likely to fail, while winding up other activities through normal insolvency procedures.\nThe overall aim is to preserve financial stability and minimise the costs to taxpayers of any CCP failure.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nEach European Union (EU) Member State has the following responsibilities.\nAppointing one or more resolution authorities. These:may be national central banks, ministries or public authorities with administrative powers;have the expertise, resources, operational capacity and extensive powers to act quickly and flexibly.\nDesignating a single ministry with overall responsibility for exercising the functions entrusted to the ministries under the legislation.\nApplying penalties for breaches of the regulation.\nResolution authorities establish, manage and chair a resolution college. This includes the relevant authorities and provides a framework to:\nshare information;\ndraw up resolution plans;\nassess a CCP’s resolvability and possible obstacles;\ncoordinate public information about resolution plans and strategies.\nThe European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA):\ndrafts various regulatory technical standards that will be adopted by the European Commission;\ncreates the ESMA Resolution Committee that will promote the drawing up and coordination of resolution plans and develop methods for the resolution of failing CCPs;\ncooperates with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Banking Authority;\nmaintains a central database of national penalties applied for breaches of the legislation.\nCompetent authorities, resolution authorities and ESMA:\ncooperate closely to carry out the tasks set out in the regulation;\nbase decisions on principles such as: proportionality in view of the CCP’s legal form, size, complexity and liquidity,the need for efficacy and timeliness, the need to keep down costs and, as far as possible, avoid use of public finance.\nRecovery planning requires CCPs to draw up and maintain a recovery plan. These:\nset out actions, with or without a default, to restore financial soundness;\ninclude measures to address all possible risks, absorb losses and replenish financial resources;\ncontain indicators based on a CCP’s risk profile;\ndo not assume access to public finance or central bank liquidity;\nconsider the interests of all stakeholders;\nensure clearing members do not have unlimited exposure to the CCP.\nIt also requires the competent authority, supervisory college and resolution authority to assess the recovery plans and consider any changes.\nResolution planning requires the following.\nThe resolution authority of the CCP has to draw up a resolution plan that: sets out how it would use its resolution powers to absorb losses and ensure the continuity of the CCP’s critical functions;takes account of the impact of the plan on clearing members, financial markets and the financial system;does not assume access to public finance or central bank help;makes prudent assumptions about finance that might be available.\nCCPs under resolution have to cooperate with the resolution authority and provide all the necessary information;\nThe resolution college has to agree on the plan, including any changes, within 4 months of receiving it.\nAssessing resolvability requires the resolution authority, coordinating with the resolution college, to:\nassess whether a CCP is resolvable, to enable it to continue operating its critical functions;\nidentify any obstacles to resolvability and instruct the CCP to take action to remove them.\nEarly intervention measures enable a competent authority to instruct a CCP it considers could be facing financial problems to:\ntake corrective action;\nremove some or all of senior management or board members.\nResolution authorities take special account of the following when implementing their plans.\nObjectives:\ncontinuity of the CCP’s critical functions;\navoidance of damage to the financial system;\nprotection of public funds.\nConditions:\nCCP actual or likely failure;\nabsence of alternative private sector solution;\nimportance of protecting the public interest.\nValuation:\ntwo assessments to ensure a fair, prudent and realistic appreciation of the CCP’s assets, liabilities, rights and obligations.\nSafeguards:\nshareholders, clearing members and other creditors should not lose more than if the resolution authority had not intervened (‘No creditor worse off’ principle);\nclients and indirect clients have the right to compensation clearing members may receive;\nanyone affected by a crisis prevention order or resolution action has a right of appeal.\nResolution authorities can apply the following measures, individually or collectively.\nPosition and loss allocation. Terminating contracts, reducing a CCP’s payment obligations to non-defaulting clearing members or requiring the latter to make a cash contribution to the CCP.\nWrite-down and conversion. Reducing or converting the size of instruments of ownership, debt or other unsecured liabilities, requiring a CCP to provide and implement a business reorganisation plan.\nSale of business. Selling ownership or any assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of a CCP in the resolution procedure.\nBridge CCP. Transferring temporarily to another CCP (‘bridge CCP’) ownership or any assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of a CCP in the resolution procedure.\nAlternative funding. Contracting to borrow or obtain other forms of financing to address temporary cash flow problems.\nMember States may, if a CCP failure threatens a systemic crisis, inject cash or take it into public ownership (government stabilisation tools), provided the measures are temporary and comply with EU State aid rules.\nThe regulation amends the following:\nRegulations (EU) No 1095/2010 (see summary), (EU) No 648/2012 (see summary), (EU) No 600/2014 (see summary), (EU) No 806/2014 (see summary) and (EU) 2015/2365 (see summary);\nDirectives 2002/47/EC (see summary), 2004/25/EC (see summary), 2007/36/EC (see summary), 2014/59/EU (see summary) and (EU) 2017/1132 (see summary).\nUnder the review procedure:\nESMA assesses its staffing and resources needs by 12 February 2024;\nthe Commission submits a report on the legislation to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union by 12 February 2026.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt entered into force on 11 February 2021 and applies from 12 August 2022 with the exception of a few articles that apply earlier.\nBACKGROUND\nCentral counterparties are an essential part of the financial system as they manage a significant amount of counterparty risk and act as a link between multiple banks, other financial counterparties and corporations.\nThe adoption of the European market infrastructure regulation, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, ensured CCPs helped increase market transparency following the 2008 financial crisis.\nFor further information, see: Recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs) (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCentral counterparty.
