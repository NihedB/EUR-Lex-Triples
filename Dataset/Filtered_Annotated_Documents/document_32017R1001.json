{"celex_id": "32017R1001", "reference": "16.6.2017\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 154/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2017/1001 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 14 June 2017\non the European Union trade mark\n(codification)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 118 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 40/94 (4), which was codified in 2009 as Regulation (EC) No 207/2009, created a system of trade mark protection specific to the Union which provided for the protection of trade marks at the level of the Union, in parallel to the protection of trade marks available at the level of the Member States in accordance with the national trade mark systems, harmonised by Council Directive 89/104/EEC (5), which was codified as Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(3)\nIt is desirable to promote throughout the Union a harmonious development of economic activities and a continuous and balanced expansion by completing an internal market which functions properly and offers conditions which are similar to those obtaining in a national market. In order to establish a market of this kind and make it increasingly a single market, not only should barriers to free movement of goods and services be removed and arrangements be instituted which ensure that competition is not distorted, but, in addition, legal conditions should be laid down which enable undertakings to adapt their activities to the scale of the Union, whether in manufacturing and distributing goods or in providing services. For those purposes, trade marks enabling the products and services of undertakings to be distinguished by identical means throughout the entire Union, regardless of frontiers, should feature amongst the legal instruments which undertakings have at their disposal.\n(4)\nFor the purpose of pursuing the Union's said objectives it would appear necessary to provide for Union arrangements for trade marks whereby undertakings can by means of one procedural system obtain EU trade marks to which uniform protection is given and which produce their effects throughout the entire area of the Union. The principle of the unitary character of the EU trade mark thus stated should apply unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n(5)\nThe barrier of territoriality of the rights conferred on proprietors of trade marks by the laws of the Member States cannot be removed by approximation of laws. In order to open up unrestricted economic activity in the whole of the internal market for the benefit of undertakings, it should be possible to register trade marks which are governed by a uniform Union law directly applicable in all Member States.\n(6)\nThe experience acquired since the establishment of the Community trade mark system has shown that undertakings from within the Union and from third countries have accepted the system which has become a successful and viable complement and alternative to the protection of trade marks at the level of the Member States.\n(7)\nThe Union law relating to trade marks nevertheless does not replace the laws of the Member States on trade marks. It would not in fact appear to be justified to require undertakings to apply for registration of their trade marks as EU trade marks.\n(8)\nNational trade marks continue to be necessary for those undertakings which do not want protection of their trade marks at Union level, or which are unable to obtain Union-wide protection while national protection does not face any obstacles. It should be left to each person seeking trade mark protection to decide whether the protection is sought only as a national trade mark in one or more Member States, or only as an EU trade mark, or both.\n(9)\nThe rights in an EU trade mark should not be obtained otherwise than by registration, and registration should be refused in particular if the trade mark is not distinctive, if it is unlawful or if it conflicts with earlier rights.\n(10)\nA sign should be permitted to be represented in any appropriate form using generally available technology, and thus not necessarily by graphic means, as long as the representation is clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.\n(11)\nThe protection afforded by an EU trade mark, the function of which is in particular to guarantee the trade mark as an indication of origin, should be absolute in the case of identity between the mark and the sign and the goods or services. The protection should apply also in cases of similarity between the mark and the sign and the goods or services. An interpretation should be given for the concept of similarity in relation to the likelihood of confusion. The likelihood of confusion, the appreciation of which depends on numerous elements and, in particular, on the recognition of the trade mark on the market, the association which can be made with the used or registered sign, the degree of similarity between the trade mark and the sign and between the goods or services identified, should constitute the specific condition for such protection.\n(12)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty and full consistency with the principle of priority, under which a registered earlier trade mark takes precedence over later registered trade marks, it is necessary to provide that the enforcement of rights conferred by an EU trade mark should be without prejudice to the rights of proprietors acquired prior to the filing or priority date of the EU trade mark. This is in conformity with Article 16(1) of the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights of 15 April 1994.\n(13)\nConfusion as to the commercial source from which the goods or services emanate may occur when a company uses the same or a similar sign as a trade name in such a way that a link is established between the company bearing the name and the goods or services coming from that company. Infringement of an EU trade mark should therefore also comprise the use of the sign as a trade name or similar designation as long as the use is made for the purposes of distinguishing goods or services.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty and full consistency with specific Union legislation, it is appropriate to provide that the proprietor of an EU trade mark should be entitled to prohibit a third party from using a sign in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising is contrary to Directive 2006/114/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(15)\nIn order to ensure trade mark protection and combat counterfeiting effectively, and in line with international obligations of the Union under the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in particular Article V of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on freedom of transit and, as regards generic medicines, the ‘Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health’ adopted by the Doha WTO Ministerial Conference on 14 November 2001, the proprietor of an EU trade mark should be entitled to prevent third parties from bringing goods, in the course of trade, into the Union without being released for free circulation there, where such goods come from third countries and bear without authorisation a trade mark which is identical or essentially identical with the EU trade mark registered in respect of such goods.\n(16)\nTo this effect, it should be permissible for EU trade mark proprietors to prevent the entry of infringing goods and their placement in all customs situations, including transit, transhipment, warehousing, free zones, temporary storage, inward processing or temporary admission, also when such goods are not intended to be placed on the market of the Union. In performing customs controls, the customs authorities should make use of the powers and procedures laid down in Regulation (EU) No 608/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council (8), also at the request of the right holders. In particular, the customs authorities should carry out the relevant controls on the basis of risk analysis criteria.\n(17)\nIn order to reconcile the need to ensure the effective enforcement of trade mark rights with the necessity to avoid hampering the free flow of trade in legitimate goods, the entitlement of the proprietor of the EU trade mark should lapse where, during the subsequent proceedings initiated before the European Union trade mark court (‘EU trade mark court’) competent to take a substantive decision on whether the EU trade mark has been infringed, the declarant or the holder of the goods is able to prove that the proprietor of the EU trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the placing of the goods on the market in the country of final destination.\n(18)\nArticle 28 of Regulation (EU) No 608/2013 provides that a right holder is to be liable for damages towards the holder of the goods where, inter alia, the goods in question are subsequently found not to infringe an intellectual property right.\n(19)\nAppropriate measures should be taken with a view to ensuring the smooth transit of generic medicines. With respect to international non-proprietary names (INN) as globally recognised generic names for active substances in pharmaceutical preparations, it is vital to take due account of the existing limitations on the effect of EU trade mark rights. Consequently, the proprietor of an EU trade mark should not have the right to prevent a third party from bringing goods into the Union without being released for free circulation there, based upon similarities between the INN for the active ingredient in the medicines and the trade mark.\n(20)\nIn order to enable proprietors of EU trade marks to combat counterfeiting effectively, they should be entitled to prohibit the affixing of an infringing mark to goods and preparatory acts carried out prior to the affixing.\n(21)\nThe exclusive rights conferred by an EU trade mark should not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use of signs or indications by third parties which are used fairly and thus in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. In order to ensure equal conditions for trade names and EU trade marks in the event of conflicts, given that trade names are regularly granted unrestricted protection against later trade marks, such use should be only considered to include the use of the personal name of the third party. It should further permit the use of descriptive or non-distinctive signs or indications in general. Furthermore, the proprietor should not be entitled to prevent the fair and honest use of the EU trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to the goods or services as those of the proprietor. Use of a trade mark by third parties to draw the consumer's attention to the resale of genuine goods that were originally sold by or with the consent of the proprietor of the EU trade mark in the Union should be considered as being fair as long as it is at the same time in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Use of a trade mark by third parties for the purpose of artistic expression should be considered as being fair as long as it is at the same time in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Furthermore, this Regulation should be applied in a way that ensures full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the freedom of expression.\n(22)\nIt follows from the principle of free movement of goods that it is essential that the proprietor of an EU trade mark not be entitled to prohibit its use by a third party in relation to goods which have been put into circulation in the European Economic Area, under the trade mark, by him or with his consent, save where there exist legitimate reasons for the proprietor to oppose further commercialisation of the goods.\n(23)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty and safeguard legitimately acquired trade mark rights, it is appropriate and necessary to lay down, without prejudice to the principle that the later trade mark cannot be enforced against the earlier trade mark, that proprietors of EU trade marks should not be entitled to oppose the use of a later trade mark if the later trade mark was acquired at a time when the earlier trade mark could not be enforced against the later trade mark.\n(24)\nThere is no justification for protecting EU trade marks or, as against them, any trade mark which has been registered before them, except where the trade marks are actually used.\n(25)\nFor reasons of equity and legal certainty, the use of an EU trade mark in a form that differs in elements which do not alter the distinctive character of that mark in the form in which it is registered should be sufficient to preserve the rights conferred regardless of whether the trade mark in the form as used is also registered.\n(26)\nAn EU trade mark is to be regarded as an object of property which exists separately from the undertakings whose goods or services are designated by it. Accordingly, it should be capable of being transferred, of being charged as security in favour of a third party and of being the subject matter of licences.\n(27)\nAdministrative measures are necessary at Union level for implementing in relation to every trade mark the trade mark law laid down by this Regulation. It is therefore essential, while retaining the Union's existing institutional structure and balance of powers, to provide for a European Union Intellectual Property Office (‘the Office’) which is independent in relation to technical matters and has legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To this end it is necessary and appropriate that the Office should be a body of the Union having legal personality and exercising the powers which are conferred on it by this Regulation, and that it should operate within the framework of Union law without detracting from the competences exercised by the Union institutions.\n(28)\nEU trade mark protection is granted in relation to specific goods or services whose nature and number determine the extent of protection afforded to the trade mark proprietor. It is therefore essential to lay down rules for the designation and classification of goods and services in this Regulation and to ensure legal certainty and sound administration by requiring that the goods and services for which trade mark protection is sought are identified by the applicant with sufficient clarity and precision to enable the competent authorities and economic operators, on the basis of the application alone, to determine the extent of the protection applied for. The use of general terms should be interpreted as only including all goods and services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the term. Proprietors of EU trade marks, which because of the practice of the Office prior to 22 June 2012 were registered in respect of the entire heading of a class of the system of classification established by the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks of 15 June 1957, should be given the possibility to adapt their lists of goods and services in order to ensure that the content of the Register meets the requisite standard of clarity and precision in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n(29)\nIn order to avoid unnecessary delays in registering an EU trade mark, it is appropriate to lay down a regime of optional EU and national trade mark searches that should be flexible in terms of user needs and preferences. The optional EU and national trade mark searches should be complemented by the making available of all-encompassing, fast and powerful search engines for the use of the public free of charge within the context of cooperation between the Office and the central industrial property offices of the Member States, including the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property.\n(30)\nIt is necessary to ensure that parties who are affected by decisions made by the Office are protected by the law in a manner which is suited to the special character of trade mark law. To that end, provision should be made for an appeal to lie from decisions of the various decision-making instances of the Office. A Board of Appeal of the Office should decide on the appeal. Decisions of the Boards of Appeal should, in turn, be amenable to actions before the General Court, which has jurisdiction to annul or to alter the contested decision.\n(31)\nIn order to ensure the protection of EU trade marks the Member States should designate, having regard to their own national system, as limited a number as possible of national courts of first and second instance having jurisdiction in matters of infringement and validity of EU trade marks.\n(32)\nIt is essential that decisions regarding the validity and infringement of EU trade marks have effect and cover the entire area of the Union, as this is the only way of preventing inconsistent decisions on the part of the courts and the Office and of ensuring that the unitary character of EU trade marks is not undermined. The provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) should apply to all actions at law relating to EU trade marks, save where this Regulation derogates from those rules.\n(33)\nContradictory judgments should be avoided in actions which involve the same acts and the same parties and which are brought on the basis of an EU trade mark and parallel national trade marks. For this purpose, when the actions are brought in the same Member State, the way in which this is to be achieved is a matter for national procedural rules, which are not prejudiced by this Regulation, whilst when the actions are brought in different Member States, provisions modelled on the rules on lis pendens and related actions of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 appear appropriate.\n(34)\nWith the aim of promoting convergence of practices and of developing common tools, it is necessary to establish an appropriate framework for cooperation between the Office and the industrial property offices of the Member States, including the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property, defining key areas of cooperation and enabling the Office to coordinate relevant common projects of interest to the Union and the Member States and to finance, up to a maximum amount, those projects. Those cooperation activities should be beneficial for undertakings using trade mark systems in Europe. For users of the Union regime laid down in this Regulation, the projects, particularly the databases for search and consultation purposes, should provide additional, inclusive, efficient tools that are free of charge to comply with the specific requirements arising from the unitary character of the EU trade mark.\n(35)\nIt is desirable to facilitate friendly, expeditious and efficient dispute resolution by entrusting the Office with the establishment of a mediation centre the services of which could be used by any person with the aim of achieving a friendly settlement of disputes relating to EU trade marks and Community designs by mutual agreement.\n(36)\nThe setting up of the EU trade mark system has resulted in increased financial burdens for the central industrial property offices and other authorities of the Member States. The additional costs are related to the handling of a higher number of opposition and invalidity proceedings involving EU trade marks or brought by proprietors of such trade marks; to the awareness-raising activities linked to the EU trade mark system; as well as to activities intended to ensure the enforcement of EU trade mark rights. It is, therefore, appropriate to ensure that the Office offset part of the costs incurred by Member States for the role they play in ensuring the smooth functioning of the EU trade mark system. The payment of such offsetting should be subject to the submission, by Member States, of relevant statistical data. The offsetting of costs should not be of such an extent that it would cause a budgetary deficit for the Office.\n(37)\nIn order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of the Office, it is considered necessary to grant it an autonomous budget whose revenue comes principally from fees paid by the users of the system. However, the Union budgetary procedure remains applicable as far as any subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the Union are concerned. Moreover, the auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors.\n(38)\nIn the interest of sound financial management, the accumulation by the Office of significant budgetary surpluses should be avoided. This should be without prejudice to the Office maintaining a financial reserve covering one year of its operational expenditure to ensure the continuity of its operations and the performance of its tasks. That reserve should only be used to ensure the continuity of the tasks of the Office as specified in this Regulation.\n(39)\nGiven the essential importance of the amounts of fees payable to the Office for the functioning of the EU trade mark system and its complementary relationship as regards national trade mark systems, it is necessary to set those fee amounts directly in this Regulation in the form of an annex. The amounts of the fees should be fixed at a level which ensures that: first, the revenue they produce is in principle sufficient for the budget of the Office to be balanced; second, there is coexistence and complementarity between the EU trade mark and the national trade mark systems, also taking into account the size of the market covered by the EU trade mark and the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises; and third, the rights of proprietors of an EU trade mark are enforced efficiently in the Member States.\n(40)\nIn order to ensure an effective, efficient and expeditious examination and registration of EU trade mark applications by the Office using procedures which are transparent, thorough, fair and equitable, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the procedures for filing and examining an opposition and on the procedures governing the amendment of the application.\n(41)\nIn order to ensure that an EU trade mark can be revoked or declared invalid in an effective and efficient way by means of transparent, thorough, fair and equitable procedures, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the procedures for revocation and declaration of invalidity.\n(42)\nIn order to allow for an effective, efficient and complete review of decisions of the Office by the Boards of Appeal by means of a transparent, thorough, fair and equitable procedure which takes into account the principles laid down in this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the formal content of the notice of appeal, the procedure for the filing and examination of an appeal, the formal content and form of the Board of Appeal's decisions, and the reimbursement of the appeal fees.\n(43)\nIn order to ensure a smooth, effective and efficient operation of the EU trade mark system, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the requirements as to the details on oral proceedings and the detailed arrangements for taking of evidence, the detailed arrangements for notification, the means of communication and the forms to be used by the parties to proceedings, the rules governing the calculation and duration of time limits, the procedures for the revocation of a decision or for cancellation of an entry in the Register, the detailed arrangements for the resumption of proceedings, and the details on representation before the Office.\n(44)\nIn order to ensure an effective and efficient organisation of the Boards of Appeal, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the organisation of the Boards of Appeal.\n(45)\nIn order to ensure the effective and efficient registration of international trade marks in a manner that is fully consistent with the rules of the Protocol relating to the Madrid Agreement concerning the international registration of marks, adopted at Madrid on 27 June 1989 (‘Madrid Protocol’), the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the procedures concerning the filing and examination of an opposition, including the necessary communications to be made to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), and the details of the procedure concerning international registrations based on a basic application or basic registration relating to a collective mark, certification mark or guarantee mark.\n(46)\nIt is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (10). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(47)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of specifying the details concerning applications, requests, certificates, claims, regulations, notifications and any other document under the relevant procedural requirements established by this Regulation, as well as in respect of maximum rates for costs essential to the proceedings and actually incurred, details concerning publications in the European Union Trade Marks Bulletin and the Official Journal of the Office, the detailed arrangements for exchange of information between the Office and national authorities, detailed arrangements concerning translations of supporting documents in written proceedings, exact types of decisions to be taken by a single member of the opposition or cancellation divisions, details of the notification obligation pursuant to the Madrid Protocol, and detailed requirements regarding the request for territorial extension subsequent to international registration. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).\n(48)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nEU trade mark\n1.   A trade mark for goods or services which is registered in accordance with the conditions contained in this Regulation and in the manner herein provided is hereinafter referred to as a ‘European Union trade mark (“EU trade mark”)’.\n2.   An EU trade mark shall have a unitary character. It shall have equal effect throughout the Union: it shall not be registered, transferred or surrendered or be the subject of a decision revoking the rights of the proprietor or declaring it invalid, nor shall its use be prohibited, save in respect of the whole Union. This principle shall apply unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nOffice\n1.   A European Union Intellectual Property Office (‘the Office’) is established.\n2.   All references in Union law to the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) shall be read as references to the Office.\nArticle 3\nCapacity to act\nFor the purpose of implementing this Regulation, companies or firms and other legal bodies shall be regarded as legal persons if, under the terms of the law governing them, they have the capacity in their own name to have rights and obligations of all kinds, to make contracts or accomplish other legal acts, and to sue and be sued.\nCHAPTER II\nTHE LAW RELATING TO TRADE MARKS\nSECTION 1\nDefinition of an EU trade mark and obtaining an EU trade mark\nArticle 4\nSigns of which an EU trade mark may consist\nAn EU trade mark may consist of any signs, in particular words, including personal names, or designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of the packaging of goods, or sounds, provided that such signs are capable of:\n(a)\ndistinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings; and\n(b)\nbeing represented on the Register of European Union trade marks (‘the Register’), in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor.\nArticle 5\nPersons who can be proprietors of EU trade marks\nAny natural or legal person, including authorities established under public law, may be the proprietor of an EU trade mark.\nArticle 6\nMeans whereby an EU trade mark is obtained\nAn EU trade mark shall be obtained by registration.\nArticle 7\nAbsolute grounds for refusal\n1.   The following shall not be registered:\n(a)\nsigns which do not conform to the requirements of Article 4;\n(b)\ntrade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character;\n(c)\ntrade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin or the time of production of the goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of the goods or service;\n(d)\ntrade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade;\n(e)\nsigns which consist exclusively of:\n(i)\nthe shape, or another characteristic, which results from the nature of the goods themselves;\n(ii)\nthe shape, or another characteristic, of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result;\n(iii)\nthe shape, or another characteristic, which gives substantial value to the goods;\n(f)\ntrade marks which are contrary to public policy or to accepted principles of morality;\n(g)\ntrade marks which are of such a nature as to deceive the public, for instance as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of the goods or service;\n(h)\ntrade marks which have not been authorised by the competent authorities and are to be refused pursuant to Article 6ter of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (‘Paris Convention’);\n(i)\ntrade marks which include badges, emblems or escutcheons other than those covered by Article 6ter of the Paris Convention and which are of particular public interest, unless the consent of the competent authority to their registration has been given;\n(j)\ntrade marks which are excluded from registration, pursuant to Union legislation or national law or to international agreements to which the Union or the Member State concerned is party, providing for protection of designations of origin and geographical indications;\n(k)\ntrade marks which are excluded from registration pursuant to Union legislation or international agreements to which the Union is party, providing for protection of traditional terms for wine;\n(l)\ntrade marks which are excluded from registration pursuant to Union legislation or international agreements to which the Union is party, providing for protection of traditional specialities guaranteed;\n(m)\ntrade marks which consist of, or reproduce in their essential elements, an earlier plant variety denomination registered in accordance with Union legislation or national law, or international agreements to which the Union or the Member State concerned is a party, providing for protection of plant variety rights, and which are in respect of plant varieties of the same or closely related species.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall apply notwithstanding that the grounds of non-registrability obtain in only part of the Union.\n3.   Paragraph 1(b), (c) and (d) shall not apply if the trade mark has become distinctive in relation to the goods or services for which registration is requested as a consequence of the use which has been made of it.\nArticle 8\nRelative grounds for refusal\n1.   Upon opposition by the proprietor of an earlier trade mark, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered:\n(a)\nif it is identical with the earlier trade mark and the goods or services for which registration is applied for are identical with the goods or services for which the earlier trade mark is protected;\n(b)\nif, because of its identity with, or similarity to, the earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade marks there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in the territory in which the earlier trade mark is protected; the likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, ‘earlier trade mark’ means:\n(a)\ntrade marks of the following kinds with a date of application for registration which is earlier than the date of application for registration of the EU trade mark, taking account, where appropriate, of the priorities claimed in respect of those trade marks:\n(i)\nEU trade marks;\n(ii)\ntrade marks registered in a Member State, or, in the case of Belgium, the Netherlands or Luxembourg, at the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property;\n(iii)\ntrade marks registered under international arrangements which have effect in a Member State;\n(iv)\ntrade marks registered under international arrangements which have effect in the Union;\n(b)\napplications for the trade marks referred to in point (a), subject to their registration;\n(c)\ntrade marks which, on the date of application for registration of the EU trade mark, or, where appropriate, of the priority claimed in respect of the application for registration of the EU trade mark, are well known in a Member State, in the sense in which the words ‘well known’ are used in Article 6bis of the Paris Convention.\n3.   Upon opposition by the proprietor of the trade mark, a trade mark shall not be registered where an agent or representative of the proprietor of the trade mark applies for registration thereof in his own name without the proprietor's consent, unless the agent or representative justifies his action.\n4.   Upon opposition by the proprietor of a non-registered trade mark or of another sign used in the course of trade of more than mere local significance, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered where and to the extent that, pursuant to Union legislation or the law of the Member State governing that sign:\n(a)\nrights to that sign were acquired prior to the date of application for registration of the EU trade mark, or the date of the priority claimed for the application for registration of the EU trade mark;\n(b)\nthat sign confers on its proprietor the right to prohibit the use of a subsequent trade mark.\n5.   Upon opposition by the proprietor of a registered earlier trade mark within the meaning of paragraph 2, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered where it is identical with, or similar to, an earlier trade mark, irrespective of whether the goods or services for which it is applied are identical with, similar to or not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered, where, in the case of an earlier EU trade mark, the trade mark has a reputation in the Union or, in the case of an earlier national trade mark, the trade mark has a reputation in the Member State concerned, and where the use without due cause of the trade mark applied for would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier trade mark.\n6.   Upon opposition by any person authorised under the relevant law to exercise the rights arising from a designation of origin or a geographical indication, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered where and to the extent that, pursuant to the Union legislation or national law providing for the protection of designations of origin or geographical indications:\n(i)\nan application for a designation of origin or a geographical indication had already been submitted, in accordance with Union legislation or national law, prior to the date of application for registration of the EU trade mark or the date of the priority claimed for the application, subject to its subsequent registration;\n(ii)\nthat designation of origin or geographical indication confers the right to prohibit the use of a subsequent trade mark.\nSECTION 2\nEffects of an EU trade mark\nArticle 9\nRights conferred by an EU trade mark\n1.   The registration of an EU trade mark shall confer on the proprietor exclusive rights therein.\n2.   Without prejudice to the rights of proprietors acquired before the filing date or the priority date of the EU trade mark, the proprietor of that EU trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade, in relation to goods or services, any sign where:\n(a)\nthe sign is identical with the EU trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered;\n(b)\nthe sign is identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with, or similar to, the goods or services for which the EU trade mark is registered, if there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public; the likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association between the sign and the trade mark;\n(c)\nthe sign is identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark irrespective of whether it is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with, similar to or not similar to those for which the EU trade mark is registered, where the latter has a reputation in the Union and where use of that sign without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the EU trade mark.\n3.   The following, in particular, may be prohibited under paragraph 2:\n(a)\naffixing the sign to the goods or to the packaging of those goods;\n(b)\noffering the goods, putting them on the market, or stocking them for those purposes under the sign, or offering or supplying services thereunder;\n(c)\nimporting or exporting the goods under the sign;\n(d)\nusing the sign as a trade or company name or part of a trade or company name;\n(e)\nusing the sign on business papers and in advertising;\n(f)\nusing the sign in comparative advertising in a manner that is contrary to Directive 2006/114/EC.\n4.

The rights conferred by an EU trade mark shall prevail against third parties from the date of publication of the registration of the trade mark.\n2.   Reasonable compensation may be claimed in respect of acts occurring after the date of publication of an EU trade mark application, where those acts would, after publication of the registration of the trade mark, be prohibited by virtue of that publication.\n3.   A court seised of a case shall not decide upon the merits of that case until the registration has been published.\nArticle 12\nReproduction of an EU trade mark in a dictionary\nIf the reproduction of an EU trade mark in a dictionary, encyclopaedia or similar reference work gives the impression that it constitutes the generic name of the goods or services for which the trade mark is registered, the publisher of the work shall, at the request of the proprietor of the EU trade mark, ensure that the reproduction of the trade mark at the latest in the next edition of the publication is accompanied by an indication that it is a registered trade mark.\nArticle 13\nProhibition of the use of an EU trade mark registered in the name of an agent or representative\nWhere an EU trade mark is registered in the name of the agent or representative of a person who is the proprietor of that trade mark, without the proprietor's authorisation, the latter shall be entitled to oppose the use of his mark by his agent or representative if he has not authorised such use, unless the agent or representative justifies his action.\nArticle 14\nLimitation of the effects of an EU trade mark\n1.   An EU trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade:\n(a)\nthe name or address of the third party, where that third party is a natural person;\n(b)\nsigns or indications which are not distinctive or which concern the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of the goods or services;\n(c)\nthe EU trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to goods or services as those of the proprietor of that trade mark, in particular, where the use of that trade mark is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts.\n2.

An EU trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit its use in relation to goods which have been put on the market in the European Economic Area under that trade mark by the proprietor or with his consent.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply where there exist legitimate reasons for the proprietor to oppose further commercialisation of the goods, especially where the condition of the goods is changed or impaired after they have been put on the market.\nArticle 16\nIntervening right of the proprietor of a later registered trade mark as a defence in infringement proceedings\n1.   In infringement proceedings, the proprietor of an EU trade mark shall not be entitled to prohibit the use of a later registered EU trade mark where that later trade mark would not be declared invalid pursuant to Article 60(1), (3) or (4), Article 61(1) or (2), or Article 64(2) of this Regulation.\n2.   In infringement proceedings, the proprietor of an EU trade mark shall not be entitled to prohibit the use of a later registered national trade mark where that later registered national trade mark would not be declared invalid pursuant to Article 8 or Article 9(1) or (2), or Article 46(3) of Directive (EU) 2015/2436 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n3.   Where the proprietor of an EU trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the use of a later registered trade mark pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2, the proprietor of that later registered trade mark shall not be entitled to prohibit the use of that earlier EU trade mark in infringement proceedings.\nArticle 17\nComplementary application of national law relating to infringement\n1.   The effects of EU trade marks shall be governed solely by the provisions of this Regulation. In other respects, infringement of an EU trade mark shall be governed by the national law relating to infringement of a national trade mark in accordance with the provisions of Chapter X.\n2.   This Regulation shall not prevent actions concerning an EU trade mark being brought under the law of Member States relating in particular to civil liability and unfair competition.\n3.   The rules of procedure to be applied shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter X.\nSECTION 3\nUse of an EU trade mark\nArticle 18\nUse of an EU trade mark\n1.   If, within a period of five years following registration, the proprietor has not put the EU trade mark to genuine use in the Union in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered, or if such use has been suspended during an uninterrupted period of five years, the EU trade mark shall be subject to the sanctions provided for in this Regulation, unless there are proper reasons for non-use.\nThe following shall also constitute use within the meaning of the first subparagraph:\n(a)\nuse of the EU trade mark in a form differing in elements which do not alter the distinctive character of the mark in the form in which it was registered, regardless of whether or not the trade mark in the form as used is also registered in the name of the proprietor;\n(b)\naffixing of the EU trade mark to goods or to the packaging thereof in the Union solely for export purposes.\n2.   Use of the EU trade mark with the consent of the proprietor shall be deemed to constitute use by the proprietor.\nSECTION 4\nEU trade marks as objects of property\nArticle 19\nDealing with EU trade marks as national trade marks\n1.   Unless Articles 20 to 28 provide otherwise, an EU trade mark as an object of property shall be dealt with in its entirety, and for the whole area of the Union, as a national trade mark registered in the Member State in which, according to the Register:\n(a)\nthe proprietor has his seat or his domicile on the relevant date;\n(b)\nwhere point (a) does not apply, the proprietor has an establishment on the relevant date.\n2.   In cases which are not provided for by paragraph 1, the Member State referred to in that paragraph shall be the Member State in which the seat of the Office is situated.\n3.   If two or more persons are mentioned in the Register as joint proprietors, paragraph 1 shall apply to the joint proprietor first mentioned; failing this, it shall apply to the subsequent joint proprietors in the order in which they are mentioned. Where paragraph 1 does not apply to any of the joint proprietors, paragraph 2 shall apply.\nArticle 20\nTransfer\n1.   An EU trade mark may be transferred, separately from any transfer of the undertaking, in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered.\n2.   A transfer of the whole of the undertaking shall include the transfer of the EU trade mark except where, in accordance with the law governing the transfer, there is agreement to the contrary or circumstances clearly dictate otherwise. This provision shall apply to the contractual obligation to transfer the undertaking.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, an assignment of the EU trade mark shall be made in writing and shall require the signature of the parties to the contract, except when it is a result of a judgment; otherwise it shall be void.\n4.   On request of one of the parties a transfer shall be entered in the Register and published.\n5.   An application for registration of a transfer shall contain information to identify the EU trade mark, the new proprietor, the goods and services to which the transfer relates, as well as documents duly establishing the transfer in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3. The application may further contain, where applicable, information to identify the representative of the new proprietor.\n6.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying:\n(a)\nthe details to be contained in the application for registration of a transfer;\n(b)\nthe kind of documentation required to establish a transfer, taking account of the agreements given by the registered proprietor and the successor in title;\n(c)\nthe details of how to process applications for partial transfers, ensuring that the goods and services in the remaining registration and the new registration do not overlap and that a separate file, including a new registration number, is established for the new registration.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 207(2).\n7.   Where the conditions applicable to the registration of a transfer, as laid down in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, or in the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 6, are not fulfilled, the Office shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, it shall reject the application for registration of the transfer.\n8.   A single application for registration of a transfer may be submitted for two or more trade marks, provided that the registered proprietor and the successor in title are the same in each case.\n9.   Paragraphs 5 to 8 shall also apply to applications for EU trade marks.\n10.   In the case of a partial transfer, any application made by the original proprietor pending with regard to the original registration shall be deemed to be pending with regard to the remaining registration and the new registration. Where such application is subject to the payment of fees and those fees have been paid by the original proprietor, the new proprietor shall not be liable to pay any additional fees with regard to such application.\n11.   As long as the transfer has not been entered in the Register, the successor in title may not invoke the rights arising from the registration of the EU trade mark.\n12.   Where there are time limits to be observed vis-à-vis the Office, the successor in title may make the corresponding statements to the Office once the request for registration of the transfer has been received by the Office.\n13.   All documents which require notification to the proprietor of the EU trade mark in accordance with Article 98 shall be addressed to the person registered as proprietor.\nArticle 21\nTransfer of a trade mark registered in the name of an agent\n1.   Where an EU trade mark is registered in the name of the agent or representative of a person who is the proprietor of that trade mark, without the proprietor's authorisation, the latter shall be entitled to demand the assignment of the EU trade mark in his favour, unless such agent or representative justifies his action.\n2.   The proprietor may submit a request for assignment pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article to the following:\n(a)\nthe Office, pursuant to Article 60(1)(b), instead of an application for a declaration of invalidity;\n(b)\na European Union trade mark court (‘EU trade mark court’) as referred to in Article 123, instead of a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity based on Article 128(1).\nArticle 22\nRights in rem\n1.   An EU trade mark may, independently of the undertaking, be given as security or be the subject of rights in rem.\n2.   At the request of one of the parties, the rights referred to in paragraph 1 or the transfer of those rights shall be entered in the Register and published.\n3.   An entry in the Register effected pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be cancelled or modified at the request of one of the parties.\nArticle 23\nLevy of execution\n1.   An EU trade mark may be levied in execution.\n2.

On request of one the parties, the levy of execution shall be entered in the Register and published.\n4.   An entry in the Register effected pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be cancelled or modified at the request of one of the parties.\nArticle 24\nInsolvency proceedings\n1.   The only insolvency proceedings in which an EU trade mark may be involved are those opened in the Member State in the territory of which the debtor has his centre of main interests.\nHowever, where the debtor is an insurance undertaking or a credit institution as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) and Directive 2001/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), respectively, the only insolvency proceedings in which an EU trade mark may be involved are those opened in the Member State where that undertaking or institution has been authorised.\n2.   In the case of joint proprietorship of an EU trade mark, paragraph 1 shall apply to the share of the joint proprietor.\n3.   Where an EU trade mark is involved in insolvency proceedings, on request of the competent national authority an entry to this effect shall be made in the Register and published in the European Union Trade Marks Bulletin referred to in Article 116.\nArticle 25\nLicensing\n1.   An EU trade mark may be licensed for some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered and for the whole or part of the Union. A licence may be exclusive or non-exclusive.\n2.   The proprietor of an EU trade mark may invoke the rights conferred by that trade mark against a licensee who contravenes any provision in his licensing contract with regard to:\n(a)\nits duration;\n(b)\nthe form covered by the registration in which the trade mark may be used;\n(c)\nthe scope of the goods or services for which the licence is granted;\n(d)\nthe territory in which the trade mark may be affixed; or\n(e)\nthe quality of the goods manufactured or of the services provided by the licensee.\n3.   Without prejudice to the provisions of the licensing contract, the licensee may bring proceedings for infringement of an EU trade mark only if its proprietor consents thereto. However, the holder of an exclusive licence may bring such proceedings if the proprietor of the trade mark, after formal notice, does not himself bring infringement proceedings within an appropriate period.\n4.   A licensee shall, for the purpose of obtaining compensation for damage suffered by him, be entitled to intervene in infringement proceedings brought by the proprietor of the EU trade mark.\n5.   On request of one of the parties the grant or transfer of a licence in respect of an EU trade mark shall be entered in the Register and published.\n6.   An entry in the Register effected pursuant to paragraph 5 shall be cancelled or modified at the request of one of the parties.\nArticle 26\nProcedure for entering licences and other rights in the Register\n1.

The application for registration of the rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be deemed to have been filed until the required fee has been paid.\n3.   The application for registration of a licence may contain a request to record a licence in the Register as one or more of the following:\n(a)\nan exclusive licence;\n(b)\na sub-licence in the event that the licence is granted by a licensee whose licence is recorded in the Register;\n(c)\na licence limited to only part of the goods or services for which the mark is registered;\n(d)\na licence limited to part of the Union;\n(e)\na temporary licence.\nWhere a request is made to record the licence as a licence listed in points (c), (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph, the application for registration of a licence shall indicate the goods and services, the part of the Union and the time period for which the licence is granted.\n4.   Where the conditions applicable to registration, as laid down in Articles 22 to 25, in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article and in the other applicable rules adopted pursuant to this Regulation, are not fulfilled, the Office shall notify the applicant of the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within a period specified by the Office, it shall reject the application for registration.\n5.

Legal acts referred to in Articles 20, 22 and 25 concerning an EU trade mark shall have effects vis-à-vis third parties in all the Member States only after entry in the Register. Nevertheless, such an act, before it is so entered, shall have effect vis-à-vis third parties who have acquired rights in the trade mark after the date of that act but who knew of the act at the date on which the rights were acquired.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply in the case of a person who acquires the EU trade mark or a right concerning the EU trade mark by way of transfer of the whole of the undertaking or by any other universal succession.\n3.   The effects vis-à-vis third parties of the legal acts referred to in Article 23 shall be governed by the law of the Member State determined in accordance with Article 19.\n4.   Until such time as common rules for the Member States in the field of bankruptcy enter into force, the effects vis-à-vis third parties of bankruptcy or similar proceedings shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which such proceedings are first brought within the meaning of national law or of conventions applicable in this field.\nArticle 28\nThe application for an EU trade mark as an object of property\nArticles 19 to 27 shall apply to applications for EU trade marks.\nArticle 29\nProcedure for cancelling or modifying the entry in the Register of licences and other rights\n1.

An application for an EU trade mark shall be filed at the Office.\n2.   The Office shall issue to the applicant, without delay, a receipt which shall include at least the file number, a representation, description or other identification of the mark, the nature and the number of the documents and the date of their receipt. That receipt may be issued by electronic means.\nArticle 31\nConditions with which applications must comply\n1.   An application for an EU trade mark shall contain:\n(a)\na request for the registration of an EU trade mark;\n(b)\ninformation identifying the applicant;\n(c)\na list of the goods or services in respect of which the registration is requested;\n(d)\na representation of the mark, which satisfies the requirements set out in Article 4(b).\n2.   The application for an EU trade mark shall be subject to the payment of the application fee covering one class of goods or services and, where appropriate, of one or more class fees for each class of goods and services exceeding the first class and, where applicable, the search fee.\n3.   In addition to the requirements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, an application for an EU trade mark shall comply with the formal requirements laid down in this Regulation and in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to it. If those conditions provide for the trade mark to be represented electronically, the Executive Director may determine the formats and maximum size of such an electronic file.\n4.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in the application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 207(2).\nArticle 32\nDate of filing\nThe date of filing of an EU trade mark application shall be the date on which the documents containing the information specified in Article 31(1) are filed with the Office by the applicant, subject to payment of the application fee within one month of filing those documents.\nArticle 33\nDesignation and classification of goods and services\n1.   Goods and services in respect of which trade mark registration is applied for shall be classified in conformity with the system of classification established by the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks of 15 June 1957 (‘the Nice Classification’).\n2.   The goods and services for which the protection of the trade mark is sought shall be identified by the applicant with sufficient clarity and precision to enable the competent authorities and economic operators, on that sole basis, to determine the extent of the protection sought.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the general indications included in the class headings of the Nice Classification or other general terms may be used, provided that they comply with the requisite standards of clarity and precision set out in this Article.\n4.   The Office shall reject an application in respect of indications or terms which are unclear or imprecise, where the applicant does not suggest an acceptable wording within a period set by the Office to that effect.\n5.   The use of general terms, including the general indications of the class headings of the Nice Classification, shall be interpreted as including all the goods or services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the indication or term. The use of such terms or indications shall not be interpreted as comprising a claim to goods or services which cannot be so understood.\n6.   Where the applicant requests registration for more than one class, the applicant shall group the goods and services according to the classes of the Nice Classification, each group being preceded by the number of the class to which that group of goods or services belongs, and shall present them in the order of the classes.\n7.   Goods and services shall not be regarded as being similar to each other on the ground that they appear in the same class under the Nice Classification. Goods and services shall not be regarded as being dissimilar from each other on the ground that they appear in different classes under the Nice Classification.\n8.   Proprietors of EU trade marks applied for before 22 June 2012 which are registered in respect of the entire heading of a Nice class may declare that their intention on the date of filing had been to seek protection in respect of goods or services beyond those covered by the literal meaning of the heading of that class, provided that the goods or services so designated are included in the alphabetical list for that class in the edition of the Nice Classification in force at the date of filing.\nThe declaration shall be filed at the Office by 24 September 2016, and shall indicate, in a clear, precise and specific manner, the goods and services, other than those clearly covered by the literal meaning of the indications of the class heading, originally covered by the proprietor's intention. The Office shall take appropriate measures to amend the Register accordingly. The possibility to make a declaration in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 18, Article 47(2), Article 58(1)(a), and Article 64(2).\nEU trade marks for which no declaration is filed within the period referred to in the second subparagraph shall be deemed to extend, as from the expiry of that period, only to goods or services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the indications included in the heading of the relevant class.\n9.   Where the register is amended, the exclusive rights conferred by the EU trade mark under Article 9 shall not prevent a third party from continuing to use a trade mark in relation to goods or services where and to the extent that the use of the trade mark for those goods or services:\n(a)\ncommenced before the register was amended; and\n(b)\ndid not infringe the proprietor's rights based on the literal meaning of the record of the goods and services in the register at that time.\nIn addition, the amendment of the list of goods or services recorded in the register shall not give the proprietor of the EU trade mark the right to oppose or to apply for a declaration of invalidity of a later trade mark where and to the extent that:\n(a)\nthe later trade mark was either in use, or an application had been made to register the trade mark, for goods or services before the register was amended; and\n(b)\nthe use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services did not infringe, or would not have infringed, the proprietor's rights based on the literal meaning of the record of the goods and services in the register at that time.\nSECTION 2\nPriority\nArticle 34\nRight of priority\n1.   A person who has duly filed an application for a trade mark in or in respect of any State party to the Paris Convention or to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, or his successors in title, shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing an EU trade mark application for the same trade mark in respect of goods or services which are identical with or contained within those for which the application has been filed, a right of priority during a period of six months from the date of filing of the first application.\n2.   Every filing that is equivalent to a regular national filing under the national law of the State where it was made or under bilateral or multilateral agreements shall be recognised as giving rise to a right of priority.\n3.   By a regular national filing is meant any filing that is sufficient to establish the date on which the application was filed, whatever may be the outcome of the application.\n4.   A subsequent application for a trade mark which was the subject of a previous first application in respect of the same goods or services and which is filed in or in respect of the same State shall be considered as the first application for the purposes of determining priority, provided that, at the date of filing of the subsequent application, the previous application has been withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without being open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding, and has not served as a basis for claiming a right of priority. The previous application may not thereafter serve as a basis for claiming a right of priority.\n5.   If the first filing has been made in a State which is not a party to the Paris Convention or to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in so far as that State, according to published findings, grants, on the basis of the first filing made at the Office and subject to conditions equivalent to those laid down in this Regulation, a right of priority having equivalent effect. The Executive Director shall, where necessary, request the Commission to consider enquiring as to whether a State within the meaning of the first sentence accords that reciprocal treatment. If the Commission determines that reciprocal treatment in accordance with the first sentence is accorded, it shall publish a communication to that effect in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n6.   Paragraph 5 shall apply from the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the communication determining that reciprocal treatment is accorded, unless the communication states an earlier date from which it is applicable. It shall cease to apply from the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of a communication of the Commission to the effect that reciprocal treatment is no longer accorded, unless the communication states an earlier date from which it is applicable.\n7.   Communications as referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 shall also be published in the Official Journal of the Office.\nArticle 35\nClaiming priority\n1.   Priority claims shall be filed together with the EU trade mark application and shall include the date, number and country of the previous application. The documentation in support of priority claims shall be filed within three months of the filing date.\n2.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the kind of documentation to be filed for claiming the priority of a previous application in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 207(2).\n3.   The Executive Director may determine that the documentation to be provided by the applicant in support of the priority claim may consist of less than what is required under the specifications adopted in accordance with paragraph 2, provided that the information required is available to the Office from other sources.\nArticle 36\nEffect of priority right\nThe right of priority shall have the effect that the date of priority shall count as the date of filing of the EU trade mark application for the purposes of establishing which rights take precedence.\nArticle 37\nEquivalence of Union filing with national filing\nAn EU trade mark application which has been accorded a date of filing shall, in the Member States, be equivalent to a regular national filing, where appropriate with the priority claimed for the EU trade mark application.\nSECTION 3\nExhibition priority\nArticle 38\nExhibition priority\n1.   If an applicant for an EU trade mark has displayed goods or services under the mark applied for, at an official or officially recognised international exhibition falling within the terms of the Convention relating to international exhibitions signed at Paris on 22 November 1928 and last revised on 30 November 1972, he may, if he files the application within a period of six months of the date of the first display of the goods or services under the mark applied for, claim a right of priority from that date within the meaning of Article 36. The priority claim shall be filed together with the EU trade mark application.\n2.   An applicant who wishes to claim priority pursuant to paragraph 1 shall file evidence of the display of goods or services under the mark applied for within three months of the filing date.\n3.   An exhibition priority granted in a Member State or in a third country shall not extend the period of priority laid down in Article 34.\n4.

The proprietor of an earlier trade mark registered in a Member State, including a trade mark registered in the Benelux countries, or registered under international arrangements having effect in a Member State, who applies for an identical trade mark for registration as an EU trade mark for goods or services which are identical with or contained within those for which the earlier trade mark has been registered, may claim for the EU trade mark the seniority of the earlier trade mark in respect of the Member State in or for which it is registered.\n2.   Seniority claims shall either be filed together with the EU trade mark application or within two months of the filing date of the application, and shall include the Member State or Member States in or for which the mark is registered, the number and the filing date of the relevant registration, and the goods and services for which the mark is registered. Where the seniority of one or more registered earlier trade marks is claimed in the application, the documentation in support of the seniority claim shall be filed within three months of the filing date. Where the applicant wishes to claim the seniority subsequent to the filing of the application, the documentation in support of the seniority claim shall be submitted to the Office within three months of receipt of the seniority claim.\n3.   Seniority shall have the sole effect under this Regulation that, where the proprietor of the EU trade mark surrenders the earlier trade mark or allows it to lapse, he shall be deemed to continue to have the same rights as he would have had if the earlier trade mark had continued to be registered.\n4.   The seniority claimed for the EU trade mark shall lapse where the earlier trade mark the seniority of which is claimed is declared to be invalid or revoked. Where the earlier trade mark is revoked, the seniority shall lapse provided that the revocation takes effect prior to the filing date or priority date of that EU trade mark.\n5.   The Office shall inform the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property or the central industrial property office of the Member State concerned of the effective claiming of seniority.\n6.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the kind of documentation to be filed for claiming the seniority of a national trade mark or a trade mark registered under international agreements having effect in a Member State in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 207(2).\n7.   The Executive Director may determine that the documentation to be provided by the applicant in support of the seniority claim may consist of less than what is required under the specifications adopted in accordance with paragraph 6, provided that the information required is available to the Office from other sources.\nArticle 40\nClaiming seniority of a national trade mark after registration of an EU trade mark\n1.   The proprietor of an EU trade mark who is the proprietor of an earlier identical trade mark registered in a Member State, including a trade mark registered in the Benelux countries or of an earlier identical trade mark, with an international registration effective in a Member State, for goods or services which are identical to those for which the earlier trade mark has been registered, or contained within them, may claim the seniority of the earlier trade mark in respect of the Member State in or for which it was registered.\n2.   Seniority claims filed pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall include the registration number of the EU trade mark, the name and address of its proprietor, the Member State or Member States in or for which the earlier mark is registered, the number and the filing date of the relevant registration, the goods and services for which the mark is registered and those in respect of which seniority is claimed, and supporting documentation as provided for in the rules adopted pursuant to Article 39(6).\n3.   If the requirements governing the claiming of seniority are not fulfilled, the Office shall communicate the deficiency to the proprietor of the EU trade mark. If the deficiency is not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, the Office shall reject the claim.\n4.   Article 39(3), (4), (5) and (7) shall apply.\nCHAPTER IV\nREGISTRATION PROCEDURE\nSECTION 1\nExamination of applications\nArticle 41\nExamination of the conditions of filing\n1.

Where the EU trade mark application does not satisfy the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, the Office shall request the applicant to remedy the deficiencies or the default on payment within two months of the receipt of the notification.\n3.   If the deficiencies or the default on payment established pursuant to paragraph 1(a) are not remedied within this period, the application shall not be dealt with as an EU trade mark application. If the applicant complies with the Office's request, the Office shall accord as the date of filing of the application the date on which the deficiencies or the default on payment established are remedied.\n4.   If the deficiencies established pursuant to paragraph 1(b) are not remedied within the prescribed period, the Office shall refuse the application.\n5.   If the default on payment established pursuant to paragraph 1(c) is not remedied within the prescribed period, the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn unless it is clear which categories of goods or services the amount paid is intended to cover. In the absence of other criteria to determine which classes are intended to be covered, the Office shall take the classes in the order of the classification. The application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn with regard to those classes for which the class fees have not been paid or have not been paid in full.\n6.   Failure to satisfy the requirements concerning the claim to priority shall result in loss of the right of priority for the application.\n7.   Failure to satisfy the requirements concerning the claiming of seniority of a national trade mark shall result in loss of that right for the application.\n8.   Where failure to satisfy the requirements referred to in paragraph 1(b) and (c) concerns only some of the goods or services, the Office shall refuse the application, or the right of priority or the right of seniority shall be lost, only in so far as those goods and services are concerned.\nArticle 42\nExamination as to absolute grounds for refusal\n1.

The Office shall, at the request of the applicant for the EU trade mark when filing the application, draw up a European Union search report (‘EU search report’) citing those earlier EU trade marks or EU trade mark applications discovered which may be invoked under Article 8 against the registration of the EU trade mark applied for.\n2.   Where, at the time of filing an EU trade mark application, the applicant requests that a search report be prepared by the central industrial property offices of the Member States and where the appropriate search fee has been paid within the time limit for the payment of the filing fee, the Office shall transmit without delay a copy of the EU trade mark application to the central industrial property office of each Member State which has informed the Office of its decision to operate a search in its own register of trade marks in respect of EU trade mark applications.\n3.   Each of the central industrial property offices of the Member States referred to in paragraph 2 shall communicate a search report which shall either cite any earlier national trade marks, national trade mark applications or trade marks registered under international agreements, having effect in the Member State or Member States concerned, which have been discovered and which may be invoked under Article 8 against the registration of the EU trade mark applied for, or state that the search has revealed no such rights.\n4.   The Office, after consulting the Management Board provided for in Article 153 (‘the Management Board’), shall establish the contents and modalities for the reports.\n5.   The Office shall pay an amount to each central industrial property office for each search report provided in accordance with paragraph 3. The amount, which shall be the same for each office, shall be fixed by the Budget Committee by means of a decision adopted by a majority of three quarters of the representatives of the Member States.\n6.   The Office shall transmit to the applicant for the EU trade mark the EU search report requested and any requested national search reports received.\n7.

If the conditions which the application for an EU trade mark is required to satisfy have been fulfilled, the application shall be published for the purposes of Article 46 to the extent that it has not been refused pursuant to Article 42. The publication of the application shall be without prejudice to information already made available to the public otherwise in accordance with this Regulation or acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n2.   Where, after publication, the application is refused pursuant to Article 42, the decision that it has been refused shall be published upon becoming final.\n3.   Where the publication of the application contains an error attributable to the Office, the Office shall of its own motion or at the request of the applicant correct the error and publish the correction.\nThe rules adopted pursuant to Article 49(3) shall apply mutatis mutandis where a correction is requested by the applicant.\n4.   Article 46(2) shall also apply where the correction concerns the list of goods or services or the representation of the mark.\n5.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 207(2).\nSECTION 4\nObservations by third parties and opposition\nArticle 45\nObservations by third parties\n1.   Any natural or legal person and any group or body representing manufacturers, producers, suppliers of services, traders or consumers may submit to the Office written observations, explaining on which grounds, under Articles 5 and 7, the trade mark should not be registered ex officio.\nPersons and groups or bodies as referred to in the first subparagraph shall not be parties to the proceedings before the Office.\n2.   Third party observations shall be submitted before the end of the opposition period or, where an opposition against the trade mark has been filed, before the final decision on the opposition is taken.\n3.   The submission referred to in paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the right of the Office to re-open the examination of absolute grounds on its own initiative at any time before registration, where appropriate.\n4.   The observations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be communicated to the applicant who may comment on them.\nArticle 46\nOpposition\n1.   Within a period of three months following the publication of an EU trade mark application, notice of opposition to registration of the trade mark may be given on the grounds that it may not be registered under Article 8:\n(a)\nby the proprietors of earlier trade marks referred to in Article 8(2) as well as licensees authorised by the proprietors of those trade marks, in respect of Article 8(1) and (5);\n(b)\nby the proprietors of trade marks referred to in Article 8(3);\n(c)\nby the proprietors of earlier marks or signs referred to in Article 8(4) and by persons authorised under the relevant national law to exercise these rights;\n(d)\nby the persons authorised under the relevant Union legislation or national law to exercise the rights referred to in Article 8(6).\n2.   Notice of opposition to registration of the trade mark may also be given, subject to the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, in the event of the publication of an amended application in accordance with the second sentence of Article 49(2).\n3.   Opposition shall be expressed in writing, and shall specify the grounds on which it is made. It shall not be considered as duly entered until the opposition fee has been paid.\n4.   Within a period to be fixed by the Office, the opponent may submit facts, evidence and arguments in support of his case.\nArticle 47\nExamination of opposition\n1.   In the examination of the opposition the Office shall invite the parties, as often as necessary, to file observations, within a period set by the Office, on communications from the other parties or issued by itself.\n2.   If the applicant so requests, the proprietor of an earlier EU trade mark who has given notice of opposition shall furnish proof that, during the five-year period preceding the date of filing or the date of priority of the EU trade mark application, the earlier EU trade mark has been put to genuine use in the Union in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered and which he cites as justification for his opposition, or that there are proper reasons for non-use, provided that the earlier EU trade mark has at that date been registered for not less than five years. In the absence of proof to this effect, the opposition shall be rejected. If the earlier EU trade mark has been used in relation to only part of the goods or services for which it is registered it shall, for the purposes of the examination of the opposition, be deemed to be registered in respect only of that part of the goods or services.\n3.   Paragraph 2 shall apply to earlier national trade marks referred to in Article 8(2)(a), by substituting use in the Member State in which the earlier national trade mark is protected for use in the Union.\n4.   The Office may, if it thinks fit, invite the parties to make a friendly settlement.\n5.   If examination of the opposition reveals that the trade mark may not be registered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which the EU trade mark application has been made, the application shall be refused in respect of those goods or services. Otherwise the opposition shall be rejected.\n6.   The decision refusing the application shall be published upon becoming final.\nArticle 48\nDelegation of powers\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 208 specifying the details of the procedure for filing and examining an opposition set out in Articles 46 and 47.\nSECTION 5\nWithdrawal, restriction, amendment and division of the application\nArticle 49\nWithdrawal, restriction and amendment of the application\n1.

The goods or services in the divisional application shall not overlap with the goods or services which remain in the original application or those which are included in other divisional applications.\n2.   The declaration of division shall not be admissible:\n(a)\nif, where an opposition has been entered against the original application, such a divisional application has the effect of introducing a division amongst the goods or services against which the opposition has been directed, until the decision of the Opposition Division has become final or the opposition proceedings are finally terminated otherwise;\n(b)\nbefore the date of filing referred to in Article 32 has been accorded by the Office and during the opposition period provided for in Article 46(1).\n3.   The declaration of division shall be subject to a fee. The declaration shall be deemed not to have been made until the fee has been paid.\n4.   Where the Office finds that the requirements laid down in paragraph 1 and in the rules adopted pursuant to paragraph 9(a) are not fulfilled, it shall invite the applicant to remedy the deficiencies within a period to be specified by the Office.

Where the grounds for revocation of rights exist in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the EU trade mark is registered, the rights of the proprietor shall be declared to be revoked in respect of those goods or services only.\nSECTION 3\nGrounds for invalidity\nArticle 59\nAbsolute grounds for invalidity\n1.   An EU trade mark shall be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings:\n(a)\nwhere the EU trade mark has been registered contrary to the provisions of Article 7;\n(b)\nwhere the applicant was acting in bad faith when he filed the application for the trade mark.\n2.   Where the EU trade mark has been registered in breach of the provisions of Article 7(1)(b), (c) or (d), it may nevertheless not be declared invalid if, in consequence of the use which has been made of it, it has after registration acquired a distinctive character in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered.\n3.

An EU trade mark shall be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings:\n(a)\nwhere there is an earlier trade mark as referred to in Article 8(2) and the conditions set out in paragraph 1 or 5 of that Article are fulfilled;\n(b)\nwhere there is a trade mark as referred to in Article 8(3) and the conditions set out in that paragraph are fulfilled;\n(c)\nwhere there is an earlier right as referred to in Article 8(4) and the conditions set out in that paragraph are fulfilled;\n(d)\nwhere there is an earlier designation of origin or geographical indication as referred to in Article 8(6) and the conditions set out in that paragraph are fulfilled.\nAll the conditions referred to in the first subparagraph shall be fulfilled at the filing date or the priority date of the EU trade mark.\n2.   An EU trade mark shall also be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings where the use of such trade mark may be prohibited pursuant to another earlier right under the Union legislation or national law governing its protection, and in particular:\n(a)\na right to a name;\n(b)\na right of personal portrayal;\n(c)\na copyright;\n(d)\nan industrial property right.\n3.

Where the proprietor of one of the rights referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 has previously applied for a declaration that an EU trade mark is invalid or made a counterclaim in infringement proceedings, he may not submit a new application for a declaration of invalidity or lodge a counterclaim on the basis of another of the said rights which he could have invoked in support of his first application or counterclaim.\n5.   Article 59(3) shall apply.\nArticle 61\nLimitation in consequence of acquiescence\n1.   Where the proprietor of an EU trade mark has acquiesced, for a period of five successive years, in the use of a later EU trade mark in the Union while being aware of such use, he shall no longer be entitled on the basis of the earlier trade mark to apply for a declaration that the later trade mark is invalid in respect of the goods or services for which the later trade mark has been used, unless registration of the later EU trade mark was applied for in bad faith.\n2.   Where the proprietor of an earlier national trade mark as referred to in Article 8(2) or of another earlier sign referred to in Article 8(4) has acquiesced, for a period of five successive years, in the use of a later EU trade mark in the Member State in which the earlier trade mark or the other earlier sign is protected while being aware of such use, he shall no longer be entitled on the basis of the earlier trade mark or of the other earlier sign to apply for a declaration that the later trade mark is invalid in respect of the goods or services for which the later trade mark has been used, unless registration of the later EU trade mark was applied for in bad faith.\n3.

The EU trade mark shall be deemed not to have had, as from the outset, the effects specified in this Regulation, to the extent that the trade mark has been declared invalid.\n3.   Subject to the national provisions relating either to claims for compensation for damage caused by negligence or lack of good faith on the part of the proprietor of the trade mark, or to unjust enrichment, the retroactive effect of revocation or invalidity of the trade mark shall not affect:\n(a)\nany decision on infringement which has acquired the authority of a final decision and been enforced prior to the revocation or invalidity decision;\n(b)\nany contract concluded prior to the revocation or invalidity decision, in so far as it has been performed before that decision; however, repayment, to an extent justified by the circumstances, of sums paid under the relevant contract may be claimed on grounds of equity.\nSECTION 5\nProceedings in the office in relation to revocation or invalidity\nArticle 63\nApplication for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity\n1.

The application shall be filed in a written reasoned statement. It shall not be deemed to have been filed until the fee has been paid.\n3.   An application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity shall be inadmissible where an application relating to the same subject matter and cause of action, and involving the same parties, has been adjudicated on its merits, either by the Office or by an EU trade mark court as referred to in Article 123, and the decision of the Office or that court on that application has acquired the authority of a final decision.\nArticle 64\nExamination of the application\n1.   On the examination of the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity, the Office shall invite the parties, as often as necessary, to file observations, within a period to be fixed by the Office, on communications from the other parties or issued by itself.\n2.   If the proprietor of the EU trade mark so requests, the proprietor of an earlier EU trade mark, being a party to the invalidity proceedings, shall furnish proof that, during the period of five years preceding the date of the application for a declaration of invalidity, the earlier EU trade mark has been put to genuine use in the Union in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered and which the proprietor of that earlier trade mark cites as justification for his application, or that there are proper reasons for non-use, provided that the earlier EU trade mark has at that date been registered for not less than five years. If, at the date on which the EU trade mark application was filed or at the priority date of the EU trade mark application, the earlier EU trade mark had been registered for not less than five years, the proprietor of the earlier EU trade mark shall furnish proof that, in addition, the conditions set out in Article 47(2) were satisfied at that date. In the absence of proof to this effect, the application for a declaration of invalidity shall be rejected. If the earlier EU trade mark has been used only in relation to part of the goods or services for which it is registered, it shall, for the purpose of the examination of the application for a declaration of invalidity, be deemed to be registered in respect of that part of the goods or services only.\n3.   Paragraph 2 shall apply to earlier national trade marks referred to in Article 8(2)(a), by substituting use in the Member State in which the earlier national trade mark is protected for use in the Union.\n4.   The Office may, if it thinks fit, invite the parties to make a friendly settlement.\n5.   If the examination of the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity reveals that the trade mark should not have been registered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered, the rights of the proprietor of the EU trade mark shall be revoked or it shall be declared invalid in respect of those goods or services. Otherwise the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity shall be rejected.\n6.

Cancellation or revocation as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined, ex officio or at the request of one of the parties to the proceedings, by the department which made the entry or took the decision. The cancellation of the entry in the Register or the revocation of the decision shall be effected within one year of the date on which the entry was made in the Register or that decision was taken, after consultation with the parties to the proceedings and any proprietor of rights to the EU trade mark in question that are entered in the Register. The Office shall keep records of any such cancellation or revocation.\n3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 208 specifying the procedure for the revocation of a decision or for the cancellation of an entry in the Register.\n4.   This Article shall be without prejudice to the right of the parties to submit an appeal under Articles 66 and 72, or to the possibility of correcting errors and manifest oversights under Article 102.

In the latter case, the appeal fee shall be reimbursed to the appellant.\nArticle 104\nRestitutio in integrum\n1.   The applicant for or proprietor of an EU trade mark or any other party to proceedings before the Office who, in spite of all due care required by the circumstances having been taken, was unable to comply with a time limit vis-à-vis the Office shall, upon application, have his rights re-established if the obstacle to compliance has the direct consequence, by virtue of the provisions of this Regulation, of causing the loss of any right or means of redress.\n2.   The application shall be filed in writing within two months of the removal of the obstacle to compliance with the time limit. The omitted act shall be completed within this period. The application shall only be admissible within the year immediately following the expiry of the unobserved time limit. In the case of non-submission of the request for renewal of registration or of non-payment of a renewal fee, the further period of six months provided in the third sentence of Article 53(3) shall be deducted from the period of one year.\n3.   The application shall state the grounds on which it is based and shall set out the facts on which it relies. It shall not be deemed to be filed until the fee for re-establishment of rights has been paid.\n4.   The department competent to decide on the omitted act shall decide upon the application.\n5.   This Article shall not be applicable to the time limits referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, Article 46(1) and (3) and Article 105.\n6.   Where the applicant for or proprietor of an EU trade mark has his rights re-established, he may not invoke his rights vis-à-vis a third party who, in good faith, has put goods on the market or supplied services under a sign which is identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark in the course of the period between the loss of rights in the application or in the EU trade mark and publication of the mention of re-establishment of those rights.\n7.   A third party who may avail himself of the provisions of paragraph 6 may bring third party proceedings against the decision re-establishing the rights of the applicant for or proprietor of an EU trade mark within a period of two months as from the date of publication of the mention of re-establishment of those rights.\n8.   Nothing in this Article shall limit the right of a Member State to grant restitutio in integrum in respect of time limits provided for in this Regulation and to be observed vis-à-vis the authorities of such State.\nArticle 105\nContinuation of proceedings\n1.   An applicant for or proprietor of an EU trade mark or any other party to proceedings before the Office who has omitted to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the Office may, upon request, obtain the continuation of proceedings, provided that at the time the request is made the omitted act has been carried out. The request for continuation of proceedings shall be admissible only if it is submitted within two months of the expiry of the unobserved time limit. The request shall not be deemed to have been filed until the fee for continuation of the proceedings has been paid.\n2.   This Article shall not apply to the time limits laid down in Article 32, Article 34(1), Article 38(1), Article 41(2), Article 46(1) and (3), Article 53(3), Article 68, Article 72(5), Article 104(2) and Article 139, or to the time limits laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article or the time limit for claiming seniority pursuant to Article 39 after the application has been filed.\n3.   The department competent to decide on the omitted act shall decide upon the application.\n4.   If the Office accepts the application, the consequences of having failed to observe the time limit shall be deemed not to have occurred. If a decision has been taken between the expiry of that time limit and the request for the continuation of proceedings, the department competent to decide on the omitted act shall review the decision and, where completion of the omitted act itself is sufficient, take a different decision. If, following the review, the Office concludes that the original decision does not require to be altered, it shall confirm that decision in writing.\n5.   If the Office rejects the application, the fee shall be refunded.\nArticle 106\nInterruption of proceedings\n1.   Proceedings before the Office shall be interrupted:\n(a)\nin the event of the death or legal incapacity of the applicant for, or proprietor of, an EU trade mark or of the person authorised by national law to act on his behalf. To the extent that that death or incapacity does not affect the authorisation of a representative appointed under Article 120, proceedings shall be interrupted only on application by such representative;\n(b)\nin the event of the applicant for, or proprietor of, an EU trade mark being prevented, for legal reasons resulting from action taken against his property, from continuing the proceedings before the Office;\n(c)\nin the event of the death or legal incapacity of the representative of an applicant for, or proprietor of, an EU trade mark, or of that representative being prevented, for legal reasons resulting from action taken against his property, from continuing the proceedings before the Office.\n2.   Proceedings before the Office shall be resumed as soon as the identity of the person authorised to continue them has been established.\n3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 208 specifying the detailed arrangements for the resumption of proceedings before the Office.\nArticle 107\nReference to general principles\nIn the absence of procedural provisions in this Regulation or in acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation, the Office shall take into account the principles of procedural law generally recognised in the Member States.\nArticle 108\nTermination of financial obligations\n1.   Rights of the Office to the payment of a fee shall be extinguished after four years from the end of the calendar year in which the fee fell due.\n2.   Rights against the Office for the refunding of fees or sums of money paid in excess of a fee shall be extinguished after four years from the end of the calendar year in which the right arose.\n3.   The period laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be interrupted, in the case covered by paragraph 1, by a request for payment of the fee, and in the case covered by paragraph 2, by a reasoned claim in writing. On interruption it shall begin again immediately and shall end at the latest six years after the end of the year in which it originally began, unless, in the meantime, judicial proceedings to enforce the right have begun; in this case the period shall end at the earliest one year after the judgment has acquired the authority of a final decision.\nSECTION 2\nCosts\nArticle 109\nCosts\n1.   The losing party in opposition proceedings, proceedings for revocation, proceedings for a declaration of invalidity or appeal proceedings shall bear the fees paid by the other party. Without prejudice to Article 146(7), the losing party shall also bear all costs incurred by the other party that are essential to the proceedings, including travel and subsistence and the remuneration of a representative within the meaning of Article 120(1), within the limits of the scales set for each category of costs in the implementing act to be adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. The fees to be borne by the losing party shall be limited to the fees paid by the other party for opposition, for an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity of the EU trade mark and for appeal.\n2.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the maximum rates for costs essential to the proceedings and actually incurred by the successful party. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 207(2).\nWhen specifying such amounts with respect to travel and subsistence costs, the Commission shall take into account the distance between the place of residence or business of the party, representative or witness or expert and the place where the oral proceedings are held, the procedural stage at which the costs have been incurred, and, as far as costs of representation within the meaning of Article 120(1) are concerned, the need to ensure that the obligation to bear the costs may not be misused for tactical reasons by the other party. Subsistence expenses shall be calculated in accordance with the Staff Regulations of Officials of the Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Union, laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 (15) (‘the Staff Regulations’ and ‘Conditions of Employment’ respectively).\nThe losing party shall bear the costs for one opposing party only and, where applicable, one representative only.\n3.   However, where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, or if reasons of equity so dictate, the Opposition Division, Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal shall decide a different apportionment of costs.\n4.   The party who terminates the proceedings by withdrawing the EU trade mark application, the opposition, the application for revocation of rights, the application for a declaration of invalidity or the appeal, or by not renewing registration of the EU trade mark or by surrendering the EU trade mark, shall bear the fees and the costs incurred by the other party as stipulated in paragraphs 1 and 3.\n5.   Where a case does not proceed to judgment the costs shall be at the discretion of the Opposition Division, Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal.\n6.   Where the parties conclude before the Opposition Division, Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal a settlement of costs differing from that provided for in paragraphs 1 to 5, the department concerned shall take note of that agreement.\n7.   The Opposition Division or Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal shall fix the amount of the costs to be paid pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 6 of this Article when the costs to be paid are limited to the fees paid to the Office and the representation costs. In all other cases, the registry of the Board of Appeal or a member of the staff of the Opposition Division or Cancellation Division shall fix, on request, the amount of the costs to be reimbursed. The request shall be admissible only for the period of two months following the date on which the decision for which an application was made for the costs to be fixed becomes final and shall be accompanied by a bill and supporting evidence. For the costs of representation pursuant to Article 120(1), an assurance by the representative that the costs have been incurred shall be sufficient. For other costs, it shall be sufficient if their plausibility is established. Where the amount of the costs is fixed pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, representation costs shall be awarded at the level laid down in the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article and irrespective of whether they have been actually incurred.\n8.   The decision on the fixing of costs, stating the reasons on which it is based, may be reviewed by a decision of the Opposition Division or Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal on a request filed within one month of the date of notification of the awarding of costs. It shall not be deemed to be filed until the fee for reviewing the amount of the costs has been paid. The Opposition Division, the Cancellation Division or the Board of Appeal, as the case may be, shall take a decision on the request for a review of the decision on the fixing of costs without oral proceedings.\nArticle 110\nEnforcement of decisions fixing the amount of costs\n1.   Any final decision of the Office fixing the amount of costs shall be enforceable.\n2.   Enforcement shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. Each Member State shall designate a single authority responsible for verifying the authenticity of the decision referred to in paragraph 1 and shall communicate its contact details to the Office, the Court of Justice and the Commission. The order for the enforcement of the decision shall be appended to the decision by that authority, with the verification of the authenticity of the decision as the sole formality.\n3.   When these formalities have been completed on application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.\n4.   Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court of Justice. However, the courts of the country concerned shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.\nSECTION 3\nInformation which may be made available to the public and to the authorities of the Member States\nArticle 111\nRegister of EU trade marks\n1.

Subject to the provisions of this Regulation as well as to any provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 applicable by virtue of Article 122, proceedings in respect of the actions and claims referred to in Article 124 shall be brought in the courts of the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled or, if he is not domiciled in any of the Member States, in which he has an establishment.\n2.   If the defendant is neither domiciled nor has an establishment in any of the Member States, such proceedings shall be brought in the courts of the Member State in which the plaintiff is domiciled or, if he is not domiciled in any of the Member States, in which he has an establishment.\n3.   If neither the defendant nor the plaintiff is so domiciled or has such an establishment, such proceedings shall be brought in the courts of the Member State where the Office has its seat.\n4.

In the actions referred to in points (a) and (c) of Article 124, a plea relating to revocation of the EU trade mark submitted otherwise than by way of a counterclaim shall be admissible where the defendant claims that the EU trade mark could be revoked for lack of genuine use at the time the infringement action was brought.\nArticle 128\nCounterclaims\n1.   A counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity may only be based on the grounds for revocation or invalidity mentioned in this Regulation.\n2.   An EU trade mark court shall reject a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity if a decision taken by the Office relating to the same subject matter and cause of action and involving the same parties has already become final.\n3.   If the counterclaim is brought in a legal action to which the proprietor of the trade mark is not already a party, he shall be informed thereof and may be joined as a party to the action in accordance with the conditions set out in national law.\n4.   The EU trade mark court with which a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity of the EU trade mark has been filed shall not proceed with the examination of the counterclaim, until either the interested party or the court has informed the Office of the date on which the counterclaim was filed. The Office shall record that information in the Register. If an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity of the EU trade mark had already been filed before the Office before the counterclaim was filed, the court shall be informed thereof by the Office and stay the proceedings in accordance with Article 132(1) until the decision on the application is final or the application is withdrawn.\n5.   Article 64(2) to (5) shall apply.\n6.   Where an EU trade mark court has given a judgment which has become final on a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity of an EU trade mark, a copy of the judgment shall be sent to the Office without delay, either by the court or by any of the parties to the national proceedings. The Office or any other interested party may request information about such transmission. The Office shall mention the judgment in the Register and shall take the necessary measures to comply with its operative part.\n7.   The EU trade mark court hearing a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity may stay the proceedings on application by the proprietor of the EU trade mark and after hearing the other parties and may request the defendant to submit an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity to the Office within a time limit which it shall determine. If the application is not made within the time limit, the proceedings shall continue; the counterclaim shall be deemed withdrawn. Article 132(3) shall apply.\nArticle 129\nApplicable law\n1.   The EU trade mark courts shall apply the provisions of this Regulation.\n2.   On all trade mark matters not covered by this Regulation, the relevant EU trade mark court shall apply the applicable national law.\n3.   Unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation, an EU trade mark court shall apply the rules of procedure governing the same type of action relating to a national trade mark in the Member State in which the court is located.\nArticle 130\nSanctions\n1.   Where an EU trade mark court finds that the defendant has infringed or threatened to infringe an EU trade mark, it shall, unless there are special reasons for not doing so, issue an order prohibiting the defendant from proceeding with the acts which infringed or would infringe the EU trade mark. It shall also take such measures in accordance with its national law as are aimed at ensuring that this prohibition is complied with.\n2.   The EU trade mark court may also apply measures or orders available under the applicable law which it deems appropriate in the circumstances of the case.\nArticle 131\nProvisional and protective measures\n1.   Application may be made to the courts of a Member State, including EU trade mark courts, for such provisional, including protective, measures in respect of an EU trade mark or EU trade mark application as may be available under the law of that State in respect of a national trade mark, even if, under this Regulation, an EU trade mark court of another Member State has jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.\n2.   An EU trade mark court whose jurisdiction is based on Article 125(1), (2), (3) or (4) shall have jurisdiction to grant provisional and protective measures which, subject to any necessary procedure for recognition and enforcement pursuant to Chapter III of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012, are applicable in the territory of any Member State. No other court shall have such jurisdiction.\nArticle 132\nSpecific rules on related actions\n1.   An EU trade mark court hearing an action referred to in Article 124 other than an action for a declaration of non-infringement shall, unless there are special grounds for continuing the hearing, of its own motion after hearing the parties or at the request of one of the parties and after hearing the other parties, stay the proceedings where the validity of the EU trade mark is already in issue before another EU trade mark court on account of a counterclaim or where an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity has already been filed at the Office.\n2.   The Office, when hearing an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity shall, unless there are special grounds for continuing the hearing, of its own motion after hearing the parties or at the request of one of the parties and after hearing the other parties, stay the proceedings where the validity of the EU trade mark is already in issue on account of a counterclaim before an EU trade mark court. However, if one of the parties to the proceedings before the EU trade mark court so requests, the court may, after hearing the other parties to these proceedings, stay the proceedings. The Office shall in this instance continue the proceedings pending before it.\n3.   Where the EU trade mark court stays the proceedings it may order provisional and protective measures for the duration of the stay.\nArticle 133\nJurisdiction of EU trade mark courts of second instance — Further appeal\n1.   An appeal to the EU trade mark courts of second instance shall lie from judgments of the EU trade mark courts of first instance in respect of proceedings arising from the actions and claims referred to in Article 124.\n2.   The conditions under which an appeal may be lodged with an EU trade mark court of second instance shall be determined by the national law of the Member State in which that court is located.\n3.   The national rules concerning further appeal shall be applicable in respect of judgments of EU trade mark courts of second instance.\nSECTION 3\nOther disputes concerning EU trade marks\nArticle 134\nSupplementary provisions on the jurisdiction of national courts other than EU trade mark courts\n1.   Within the Member State whose courts have jurisdiction under Article 122(1) those courts shall have jurisdiction for actions other than those referred to in Article 124, which would have jurisdiction ratione loci and ratione materiae in the case of actions relating to a national trade mark registered in that State.\n2.   Actions relating to an EU trade mark, other than those referred to in Article 124, for which no court has jurisdiction under Article 122(1) and paragraph 1 of this Article may be heard before the courts of the Member State in which the Office has its seat.\nArticle 135\nObligation of the national court\nA national court which is dealing with an action relating to an EU trade mark, other than the action referred to in Article 124, shall treat the EU trade mark as valid.\nCHAPTER XI\nEFFECTS ON THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES\nSECTION 1\nCivil actions on the basis of more than one trade mark\nArticle 136\nSimultaneous and successive civil actions on the basis of EU trade marks and national trade marks\n1.

The court which would be required to decline jurisdiction may stay its proceedings if the jurisdiction of the other court is contested;\n(b)\nthe court other than the court first seised may stay its proceedings where the trade marks concerned are identical and valid for similar goods or services and where the trade marks concerned are similar and valid for identical or similar goods or services.\n2.   The court hearing an action for infringement on the basis of an EU trade mark shall reject the action if a final judgment on the merits has been given on the same cause of action and between the same parties on the basis of an identical national trade mark valid for identical goods or services.\n3.   The court hearing an action for infringement on the basis of a national trade mark shall reject the action if a final judgment on the merits has been given on the same cause of action and between the same parties on the basis of an identical EU trade mark valid for identical goods or services.\n4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply in respect of provisional, including protective, measures.\nSECTION 2\nApplication of national laws for the purpose of prohibiting the use of EU trade marks\nArticle 137\nProhibition of use of EU trade marks\n1.   This Regulation shall, unless otherwise provided for, not affect the right existing under the laws of the Member States to invoke claims for infringement of earlier rights within the meaning of Article 8 or Article 60(2) in relation to the use of a later EU trade mark. Claims for infringement of earlier rights within the meaning of Article 8(2) and (4) may, however, no longer be invoked if the proprietor of the earlier right may no longer apply for a declaration that the EU trade mark is invalid in accordance with Article 61(2).\n2.   This Regulation shall, unless otherwise provided for, not affect the right to bring proceedings under the civil, administrative or criminal law of a Member State or under provisions of Union law for the purpose of prohibiting the use of an EU trade mark to the extent that the use of a national trade mark may be prohibited under the law of that Member State or under Union law.\nArticle 138\nPrior rights applicable to particular localities\n1.   The proprietor of an earlier right which only applies to a particular locality may oppose the use of the EU trade mark in the territory where his right is protected in so far as the law of the Member State concerned so permits.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the proprietor of the earlier right has acquiesced in the use of the EU trade mark in the territory where his right is protected for a period of five successive years, being aware of such use, unless the EU trade mark was applied for in bad faith.\n3.   The proprietor of the EU trade mark shall not be entitled to oppose use of the right referred to in paragraph 1 even though that right may no longer be invoked against the EU trade mark.\nSECTION 3\nConversion into a national trade mark application\nArticle 139\nRequest for the application of national procedure\n1.   The applicant for or proprietor of an EU trade mark may request the conversion of his EU trade mark application or EU trade mark into a national trade mark application:\n(a)\nto the extent that the EU trade mark application is refused, withdrawn, or deemed to be withdrawn;\n(b)\nto the extent that the EU trade mark ceases to have effect.\n2.   Conversion shall not take place:\n(a)\nwhere the rights of the proprietor of the EU trade mark have been revoked on the grounds of non-use, unless in the Member State for which conversion is requested the EU trade mark has been put to use which would be considered to be genuine use under the laws of that Member State;\n(b)\nfor the purpose of protection in a Member State in which, in accordance with the decision of the Office or of the national court, grounds for refusal of registration or grounds for revocation or invalidity apply to the EU trade mark application or EU trade mark.\n3.   The national trade mark application resulting from the conversion of an EU trade mark application or an EU trade mark shall enjoy in respect of the Member State concerned the date of filing or the date of priority of that application or trade mark and, where appropriate, the seniority of a trade mark of that State claimed under Articles 39 or 40.\n4.   In cases where an EU trade mark application is deemed to be withdrawn, the Office shall send to the applicant a communication fixing a period of three months from the date of that communication in which a request for conversion may be filed.\n5.   Where the EU trade mark application is withdrawn or the EU trade mark ceases to have effect as a result of a surrender being recorded or of failure to renew the registration, the request for conversion shall be filed within three months of the date on which the EU trade mark application has been withdrawn or on which the EU trade mark ceases to have effect.\n6.   Where the EU trade mark application is refused by decision of the Office or where the EU trade mark ceases to have effect as a result of a decision of the Office or of an EU trade mark court, the request for conversion shall be filed within three months of the date on which that decision acquired the authority of a final decision.\n7.

If the Office or an EU trade mark court has refused the EU trade mark application or has declared the EU trade mark invalid on absolute grounds which are found to apply throughout the Union or on account of an earlier EU trade mark or other Union industrial property right, conversion shall be excluded under Article 139(2) for all Member States.\n5.   Where the request for conversion complies with the requirements referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the Office shall transmit the request for conversion and the data referred to in Article 111(2) to the central industrial property offices of the Member States, including the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property, for which the request has been found admissible.

The Executive Director shall lay down the amount to be charged for any services rendered by the Office other than those set out in Annex I, as well as the amount to be charged for the European Union Trade Marks Bulletin, the Official Journal of the Office and any other publications issued by the Office.

The amount of each charge shall not exceed what is necessary to cover the costs of the specific service rendered by the Office.\n2.   Fees and charges in respect of which the due date is not specified in this Regulation shall be due on the date of receipt of the request for the service for which the fee or the charge is incurred.\nWith the consent of the Budget Committee, the Executive Director may determine which of the services mentioned in the first subparagraph are not to be dependent upon the advance payment of the corresponding fees or charges.\nArticle 179\nPayment of fees and charges\n1.   Fees and charges due to the Office shall be paid by payment or transfer to a bank account held by the Office.\nWith the consent of the Budget Committee, the Executive Director may establish which specific methods of payment other than those set out in the first subparagraph, in particular by means of deposits in current accounts held with the Office, may be used.\nDeterminations made pursuant to the second subparagraph shall be published in the Official Journal of the Office.\nAll payments, including by any other method of payment established pursuant to the second subparagraph, shall be made in euros.\n2.   Every payment shall indicate the name of the person making the payment and shall contain the necessary information to enable the Office to establish immediately the purpose of the payment. In particular, the following information shall be provided:\n(a)\nwhen the application fee is paid, the purpose of the payment, namely ‘application fee’;\n(b)\nwhen the opposition fee is paid, the file number of the application and the name of the applicant for the EU trade mark against which opposition is entered, and the purpose of the payment, namely ‘opposition fee’;\n(c)\nwhen the revocation fee and the invalidity fee are paid, the registration number and the name of the proprietor of the EU trade mark against which the application is directed, and the purpose of the payment, namely ‘revocation fee’ or ‘invalidity fee’.\n3.   If the purpose of the payment referred to in paragraph 2 cannot immediately be established, the Office shall require the person making the payment to notify it in writing of this purpose within such period as it may specify. If the person does not comply with this request in due time, the payment shall be considered not to have been made. The amount which has been paid shall be refunded.\nArticle 180\nDeemed date of payment\n1.   In the cases referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 179(1), the date on which the payment shall be considered to have been made to the Office shall be the date on which the amount of the payment or of the transfer is actually entered in a bank account held by the Office.\n2.   Where the methods of payment referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 179(1) may be used, the Executive Director shall establish the date on which such payments are to be considered to have been made.\n3.   Where, under paragraphs 1 and 2, payment of a fee is not considered to have been made until after the expiry of the period in which it was due, it shall be considered that this period has been observed if evidence is provided to the Office that the persons who made the payment in a Member State, within the period within which the payment should have been made, duly gave an order to a banking establishment to transfer the amount of the payment, and paid a surcharge of 10 % of the relevant fee or fees, but not exceeding EUR 200. No surcharge shall be payable if the relevant order to the banking establishment has been given not later than 10 days before the expiry of the period for payment.\n4.   The Office may request the person who made the payment to produce evidence as to the date on which the order to the banking establishment as referred to in paragraph 3 was given and, where required, to pay the relevant surcharge within a period to be specified by it. If the person fails to comply with that request or if the evidence is insufficient, or if the required surcharge is not paid in due time, the period for payment shall be considered not to have been observed.\nArticle 181\nInsufficient payments and refund of insignificant amounts\n1.   A time limit for payment shall, in principle, be considered to have been observed only if the full amount of the fee has been paid in due time. If the fee is not paid in full, the amount which has been paid shall be refunded after the period for payment has expired.\n2.   The Office may, however, in so far as is possible within the time remaining before the end of the period, give the person making the payment the opportunity to pay the amount lacking or, where this is considered justified, overlook any small amounts lacking, without prejudice to the rights of the person making the payment.\n3.   With the consent of the Budget Committee, the Executive Director may waive action for the enforced recovery of any sum due where the sum to be recovered is minimal or where such recovery is too uncertain.\n4.   Where an excessive sum is paid to cover a fee or a charge, the excess shall not be refunded if the amount is insignificant and the party concerned has not expressly requested a refund.\nWith the consent of the Budget Committee the Executive Director may determine the amount below which an excessive sum paid to cover a fee or a charge shall not be refunded.\nDeterminations pursuant to the second subparagraph shall be published in the Official Journal of the Office.\nCHAPTER XIII\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTRATION OF MARKS\nSECTION I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 182\nApplication of provisions\nUnless otherwise specified in this chapter, this Regulation and the acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation shall apply to applications for international registrations under the Madrid Protocol (‘international applications’), based on an application for an EU trade mark or on an EU trade mark and to registrations of marks in the international register maintained by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (‘international registrations’ and ‘the International Bureau’, respectively) designating the Union.\nSECTION 2\nInternational registration on the basis of applications for an EU trade mark and of EU trade marks\nArticle 183\nFiling of an international application\n1.

If the deficiencies referred to in paragraph 5 are not remedied or the required indications referred to in paragraph 6 are not given within the period fixed by the Office, the Office shall refuse to forward the international application to the International Bureau.\n8.   The Office shall forward the international application to the International Bureau along with the certification provided for under Article 3(1) of the Madrid Protocol as soon as the international application meets the requirements laid down in this Article, the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article, and in Article 183 of this Regulation.\n9.

If no refusal has been notified in accordance with Article 5(1) and (2) of the Madrid Protocol or if any such refusal has been withdrawn, the international registration of a mark designating the Union shall, from the date referred to in paragraph 1, have the same effect as the registration of a mark as an EU trade mark.\n3.   For the purposes of applying Article 11 of this Regulation, publication of the particulars of the international registration designating the Union pursuant to Article 190(1) shall take the place of publication of an EU trade mark application, and publication pursuant to Article 190(2) shall take the place of publication of the registration of an EU trade mark.\nArticle 190\nPublication\n1.   The Office shall publish the date of registration of a mark designating the Union pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Madrid Protocol or the date of the subsequent designation of the Union pursuant to Article 3ter(2) of the Madrid Protocol, the language of filing of the international application and the second language indicated by the applicant, the number of the international registration and the date of publication of such registration in the Gazette published by the International Bureau, a reproduction of the mark and the numbers of the classes of the goods or services in respect of which protection is claimed.\n2.

The applicant for an international registration designating the Union may claim, in the international application, the seniority of an earlier trade mark registered in a Member State, including a trade mark registered in the Benelux countries, or registered under international arrangements having effect in a Member State, as provided for in Article 39.\n2.   The documentation, as specified in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 39(6), in support of the seniority claim shall be submitted within three months of the date on which the International Bureau notifies the international registration to the Office. In this regard, Article 39(7) shall apply.\n3.   Where the holder of the international registration is obliged to be represented before the Office pursuant to Article 119(2), the communication as referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall contain the appointment of a representative within the meaning of Article 120(1).\n4.   Where the Office finds that the seniority claim under paragraph 1 of this Article does not comply with Article 39, or does not comply with the other requirements laid down in this Article, it shall invite the applicant to remedy the deficiencies. If the requirements referred to in the first sentence are not satisfied within the time limit specified by the Office, the right of seniority in respect of that international registration shall be lost. If the deficiencies concern only some of the goods and services, the right of seniority shall be lost only in so far as those goods and services are concerned.\n5.   The Office shall inform the International Bureau of any declaration of a loss of the right of seniority pursuant to paragraph 4. It shall also inform the International Bureau of any withdrawal or restriction of the seniority claim.\n6.   Article 39(5) shall apply, unless the right of seniority is declared lost pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article.\nArticle 192\nSeniority claimed before the Office\n1.

A seniority claim under paragraph 1 of this Article shall fulfil the requirements referred to in Article 40 and shall contain information to enable its examination against those requirements.\n4.   If the requirements governing the claiming of seniority referred to in paragraph 3 and specified in the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 6 are not fulfilled, the Office shall invite the holder of the international registration to remedy the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, the Office shall reject the claim.\n5.   Where the Office has accepted the seniority claim, or where a seniority claim has been withdrawn or cancelled by the Office, the Office shall inform the International Bureau accordingly.\n6.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in a seniority claim under paragraph 1 of this Article and the details of the information to be notified pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article.

Where the holder of an international registration fails to overcome the ground for refusing protection within the time limit or, if appropriate, to appoint a representative or to indicate a second language, the Office shall refuse the protection in whole or for part of the goods and services for which the international registration is registered. The refusal of protection shall take the place of a refusal of an EU trade mark application. The decision shall be subject to appeal in accordance with Articles 66 to 72.\n7.   Where, as of the start of the opposition period referred to in Article 196(2), the Office has not issued an ex officio provisional notification of refusal pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, it shall send a statement to the International Bureau, indicating that the examination of absolute grounds of refusal pursuant to Article 42 has been completed but that the international registration is still subject to oppositions or observations of third parties. This interim statement shall be without prejudice to the right of the Office to re-open the examination of absolute grounds on its own initiative any time before the final statement of grant of protection has been issued.\n8.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in the notification of ex officio provisional refusal of protection to be sent to the International Bureau and in the final communications to be sent to the International Bureau on the final grant or refusal of protection.

The Office shall inform the proprietors of any earlier EU trade marks or EU trade mark applications cited in the Union search report of the publication of the international registration designating the Union as provided for in Article 190(1).

The effects of an international registration designating the Union may be declared invalid.\n2.   The application for invalidation of the effects of an international registration designating the Union shall take the place of an application for a declaration of revocation as provided for in Article 58 or for a declaration of invalidity as provided for in Article 59 or Article 60.\n3.   Where pursuant to Article 64 or Article 128 of this Regulation and this Article, the effects of an international registration designating the Union have been declared invalid by means of a final decision, the Office shall notify the International Bureau in accordance with Article 5(6) of the Madrid Protocol.\n4.

Union trade mark\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt establishes EU-wide rules and conditions for the granting of an EU trade mark.\nIt codifies and replaces Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and its numerous successive amendments.\nKEY POINTS\nEU trade mark\nAny person or company, including authorities established under public law, may obtain an EU trade mark through registration.\nIt may consist of any signs, in particular words (including personal names), designs, letters, numerals and the shape of goods or of their packaging, provided that such signs are capable of:\ndistinguishing the goods or services of one business from those of another; and\nbeing represented on the register of trade marks in such a way that the public and the authorities know exactly the subject matter that is being protected.\nOwner’s rights\nIt grants the owner exclusive rights, which prohibit third parties from using any of the following for commercial purposes:\nany sign which is identical with the EU trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered;\nany sign where there is a likelihood of confusion with another trade mark;\nany sign which is identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the EU trade mark is registered, where use of that sign takes advantage of the reputation and distinctive character of the trade mark.\nHowever, the owner of the EU trade mark may not prohibit third parties from using the following for commercial purposes:\nthe owner’s own name or address;\nindications concerning characteristics of goods or services such as the kind, quality or quantity;\nthe trade mark where it is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, as accessories or spare parts.\nApplication\nApplicants must file an application for an EU trade mark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).\nThe application must contain the following information:\na request for the registration of a EU trade mark,\ninformation identifying the applicant,\na list of the goods or services in respect of which the registration is requested,\na representation of the trade mark.\nApplicants must also pay an application fee. The application fee must be paid within 1 month of the filing date — the date on which the documents are filed with the EUIPO.\nRegistration\nOnce the application has been filed, EUIPO will examine whether it meets all the conditions for the granting of an EU trade mark.\nPublication of the application will allow third parties opposed to the granting of the trade mark to do so, on the basis of earlier rights, in opposition proceedings.\nIf the application meets all the required criteria and no opposition is either entered or accepted, then the trade mark registration is published.\nDuration and renewal\nEU trade marks are registered for a period of 10 years from the date of filing of the application.\nRegistration may be renewed for further periods of 10 years. The renewal application must be filed 6 months before the end of the validity of the registration.\nSurrender, revocation and invalidity\nAn EU trade mark may be surrendered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered. The rights of the owner may also be revoked if:\nthe trade mark has not been subject to genuine use* in the EU for 5 years;\nthe trade mark has become the common name for a product or service;\nthe trade mark could deceive the public as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of the goods or services.\nThe regulation also establishes grounds for invalidity of the trade mark. These grounds include, for example, cases where the applicant acted in bad faith when filing the application for the trade mark.\nEU collective marksWhen an application for registration is filed, it is possible to designate an EU trade mark as being collective. The following are authorised to file EU collective marks — associations of:\nmanufacturers\nproducers\nsuppliers of services\ntraders\nlegal persons governed by public law.\nEU certification marksIt is also possible to designate an EU trade mark as a certification mark. The owner of such a mark certifies the material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services, quality, accuracy or other characteristics (excluding geographical origin) of the certified goods and services.\nLegal action\nRegulation (EU) No 1215/2012 applies to proceedings relating to EU trade marks and applications for EU trade marks, as well as to simultaneous and successive actions on the basis of EU and national trade marks.EU countries must designate ‘EU trade mark courts’. These courts have exclusive jurisdiction in all disputes concerning the infringement and validity of EU trade marks.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 October 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nEUIPO replaces the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market from 23 March 2016 in line with Regulation (EU) 2015/2424 which amended Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 both of which were replaced by Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 .\nFor more information, see:\nEUIPO — trade marks.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nGenuine use: if a company registers an EU trade mark, uses it for a period and then stops using it for a continuous period of 5 years, the trade mark may be revoked. This is because there is no value in giving protection to trade marks if they are not being used and there is no interest in preventing another company, that might legitimately wish to use the mark, from using it.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the European Union trade mark (OJ L 154, 16.6.2017, pp. 1-99)\nlast update 13.02.2018", "tags": ["registered trademark", "trademark law", "EU trade mark", "codification of EU law"], "subjects": ["Intellectual, industrial and commercial property"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32017R1001_p1": {"text": "EUIPO replaces the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market from 23 March 2016 in line with regulation 2015/2424 which amended regulation 207/2009 both of which were replaced by regulation 2017/1001 .", "triples": [" regulation 2015/2424,  amended,  regulation 207/2009", " regulation 2017/1001,  replaced,  regulation 207/2009", " regulation 2017/1001,  replaced,  regulation 2015/2424"]}}}
