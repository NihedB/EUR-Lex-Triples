The rules on technical standards included in bilateral agreements or arrangements between Member States of the Community and Contracting Parties of the Interbus Agreement, concerning bilateral traffic and transit, which are stricter than the rules established in this Agreement may be applied until 31 December 2006.2. Member States of the Community and Contracting Parties of the Interbus Agreement concerned shall inform the Joint Committee established in Article 23 of the Agreement on the contents of such bilateral agreements or arrangements.Article 71. A document proving the date of the vehicle's first registration shall be kept on board and shall be presented at the request of any authorised inspecting officer. For the purpose of this Annex, the terms \"date of vehicle's first registration\" shall refer to the first registration of the vehicle after its manufacture. When this date of registration is not available, it will be referred to as the date of construction.2. Where the original bus engine has been replaced by a new engine, the document referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be substituted by a document proving the compliance of the new engine with the relevant type-approval rules mentioned in Article 3.Article 81. Notwithstanding the provision referred to in paragraph (a) of Article 1 of this Annex, Contracting Parties may establish random inspections in order to control that the buses and coaches concerned comply with the provisions of Directive 96/96/EC. For the purpose of this Annex \"random inspections\" shall mean an unscheduled and therefore unexpected inspection of a bus or coach circulating on the territory of a Contracting Party carried out by the authorities at the roadside.2. In order to carry out the roadside inspection provided for in this Annex, competent authorities of Contracting Parties shall use the checklist included in Annex IIa and IIb. A copy of this checklist drawn up by the authority which carried it out shall be given to the driver of the bus or coach and presented on request in order to simplify or avoid, where possible, subsequent inspections within a short and unreasonable period.3. If the vehicle examiner considers that the deficiency in the maintenance of the bus or coach justifies further examination, the bus or coach may be subjected to a roadworthiness test at an approved testing centre in accordance with Article 2 of Directive 96/96/EC.4. Without prejudice to other penalties which may be imposed, if the consequence of the random inspection is that the bus or coach does not comply with the provisions of Directive 96/96/EC and therefore is considered to present a serious risk to its occupants or other road users, the bus or coach may be banned immediately from use on public roads.5. Roadside checks shall be carried out without discrimination on the grounds of nationality, residence or registration of buses and coaches and drivers respectively.ANNEX IIa>PIC FILE= \"L_2002321EN.002902.TIF\">ANNEX IIbTECHNICAL STANDARDS OF THE ROADSIDE CHECKBuses and coaches as defined in Article 3 of this Agreement shall be maintained in such a condition that they can be deemed as roadworthy by the inspection authorities.The items that shall be inspected will include those that are considered to be important for the safe and clean operation of the bus or coach. As well as simple functional checks (lighting, signalling, tyre condition, etc.), specific tests and/or inspections shall be carried out on the vehicle's brakes and the motor vehicle's emissions in the following manner:1. BrakesEvery part of the braking system and its means of operation shall be maintained in good and efficient working order and be properly adjusted.The bus or coach's brakes shall be capable of performing the following three braking functions:(a) for buses and coaches and their trailers and semi-trailers, a service brake capable of slowing down the vehicle and of stopping it safely, rapidly and efficiently, whatever its conditions of loading and whatever the upward or downward gradient of the road on which it is moving;(b) for buses and coaches and their trailers and semi-trailers, a parking brake capable of holding the bus or coach stationary, whatever its condition of loading, on a noticeable upward or downward gradient, the operative surfaces of the brake being held in the braking position by a device whose action is purely mechanical;(c) for buses and coaches, a secondary (emergency) brake capable of slowing down and stopping the bus or coach, whatever its condition of loading, within a reasonable distance, even in the event of failure of the service brake.Where the maintenance condition of the bus or coach is in doubt, the inspection authorities may test the bus' or coach's braking performance in accordance with some or all of the provisions of Directive 96/96/EC Annex II(I).2. Exhaust emissions2.1. Exhaust emission2.1.1. Buses and coaches equipped with positive-ignition (petrol) engines(a) Where the exhaust emissions are not controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter which is lambda-probe controlled:1. visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that there is no leakage;2. if appropriate, visual inspection of the emission control system in order to check that the required equipment has been fitted.After a reasonable period of engine conditioning (taking account of the bus or coach manufacturer's recommendations) the carbon monoxide (CO) content of the exhaust gases is measured when the engine is idling (no load).The maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the bus or coach manufacturer. Where this information is not available or where Member States' competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference value, the CO content must not exceed the following:- for buses and coaches registered or put into service for the first time between the date from which Contracting Parties required the buses and coaches to comply with Directive 70/220/EEC(1) and 1 October 1986: CO - 4,5 % vol,- for buses and coaches registered or put into service for the first time after 1 October 1986: CO - 3,5 % vol.(b) Where the exhaust emissions are controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter which is lambda-probe controlled:1. visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that there are no leakages and that all parts are complete;2. visual inspection of the emission control system in order to check that the required equipment has been fitted;3. determination of the efficiency of the bus or coach's emission control system by measuring the lambda value and the CO content of the exhaust gases in accordance with Section 4 or with the procedures proposed by the manufacturers and approved at the time of type-approval. For each of the tests, the engine is conditioned in accordance with the bus or coach manufacturer's recommendations;4. exhaust pipe emissions - limit values:measurement at engine idling speed:the maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the bus or coach manufacturer. Where this information is not available, the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,5 % volMeasurement at high idle speed, engine speed to be at least 2000 min-1:CO content: maximum 0,3 % vollambda: 1 ± 0,03 in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.2.1.2. Buses and coaches equipped with compression ignition (diesel) enginesMeasurement of exhaust gas opacity with free acceleration (no load from idling up to cut-off speed). The level of concentration must not exceed the level recorded on the plate pursuant to Directive 72/306/EEC(2). Where this information is not available or where Contracting Parties' competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference, the limit values of the coefficient of absorption are as follows:maximum coefficient of absorption for:- naturally aspirated diesel engines = 2,5 m-1,- turbo-charged diesel engines = 3,0 m-1or equivalent values where use is made of equipment of a type different from that used for EC type-approval.2.1.3. Test equipmentBuses' and coaches' emissions are tested using equipment designed to establish accurately whether the limit values prescribed or indicated by the manufacturer have been complied with.2.2.

Agreement)THE CONTRACTING PARTIES:Having regard to the desire to promote the development of international transport in Europe and especially to facilitate the organisation and operation thereof,Having regard to the desire to facilitate tourism and cultural exchange between the Contracting Parties,Whereas:The Agreement on the international carriage of passengers by road by means of occasional coach and bus services (ASOR), signed in Dublin on 26 May 1982 does not provide for any scope for the accession of new Parties.The experience and the liberalisation achieved by this latter Agreement should be maintained.It is desirable to provide for harmonised liberalisation of certain international occasional services by coach and bus and the transit operations thereof.It is desirable to provide for certain harmonised rules of procedure for non-liberalised international occasional services, that are thus still subject to authorisation.It is necessary to provide for a high degree of harmonisation of the technical conditions applying to buses and coaches carrying out international occasional services between Contracting Parties in order to improve road safety and protection of the environment.It is necessary that Contracting Parties should apply uniform measures concerning the work of the crews of buses and coaches engaged in international road transport.It is desirable to provide for harmonisation of the conditions for access to the occupation of road passenger transport operator.The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality or the place of establishment of the transport operator, and of the origin or destination of the bus or coach, should be considered to be a basic condition applying to the provision of international transport services.It is necessary to provide for uniform models for transport documents such as the control document for liberalised occasional services and also the authorisation and the application form for non-liberalised services in order to facilitate and simplify inspection procedures.It is necessary to provide for certain harmonised measures on the enforcement of the Agreement, especially as far as control procedures, penalties and mutual assistance are concerned.It is appropriate to establish certain procedures for the management of the Agreement in order to ensure proper enforcement and to permit some technical adaptation of the Annexes.The Agreement should be open for accession to future members of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport and to certain other European countries,HAVE DECIDED to establish uniform rules for the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus, andHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:SECTION ISCOPE AND DEFINITIONSArticle 1Scope1. This Agreement shall apply:(a) to the international carriage of passengers, of any nationality, by road by means of occasional services:- between the territories of two Contracting Parties, or starting and finishing on the territory of the same Contracting Party and, should the need arise during such services, in transit through the territory of another Contracting Party or through the territory of a non-Contracting State,- carried out by transport operators for hire or reward established in a Contracting Party in accordance with its law and holding a licence to undertake carriage by means of international occasional services by coach and bus,- using buses and coaches registered in the Contracting Party where the transport operator is established;(b) to unladen journeys of the buses and coaches concerned with these services.2. None of the provisions of this Agreement may be interpreted as providing the possibility of operating national occasional services in the territory of a Contracting Party by operators established in another Contracting Party.3. The use of buses and coaches designed to carry passengers for the transport of goods for commercial purposes shall be excluded from the scope of this Agreement.4. This Agreement does not concern own-account occasional services.Article 2Non-discriminationContracting Parties shall ensure that the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of the nationality or the place of establishment of the transport operator, and of the origin or destination of the bus or coach, is applied, in particular with regard to fiscal provisions as established in section VI, as well as control and penalties as established in section IX.Article 3DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:1. \"buses and coaches\" are vehicles which, by virtue of their construction and their equipment, are suitable for carrying more than nine persons, including the driver, and are intended for that purpose;2. \"international occasional services\" are services between the territory of at least two Contracting Parties falling within neither the definition of regular services or special regular services nor the definition of a shuttle service. Such services may be operated with some degree of frequency without thereby ceasing to be occasional services;3. \"regular services\" are services which provide for the carriage of passengers according to a specified frequency and along specified routes, whereby passengers may be taken up or set down at predetermined stopping points. Regular services can be subject to the obligation to respect previously established timetables and tariffs;4. \"special regular services\" are services, by whomsoever organised, which provide for the carriage of specified categories of passengers to the exclusion of other passengers, in so far as such services are operated under the conditions specified in point 3. Special regular services shall include:- the carriage of workers between home and work,- the carriage of school pupils and students to and from the educational institution.The fact that a special regular service may be varied according to the needs of users shall not affect its classification as a regular service;5. 1. \"shuttle services\" are services whereby, by means of repeated outward and return journeys, previously formed groups of passengers are carried from a single place of departure to a single destination. Each group, consisting of the passengers who made the outward journey, shall be carried back to the place of departure on a later journey by the same transport operator.Place of departure and destination shall mean, respectively, the place where the journey begins and the place where the journey ends, together with, in each case, the surrounding localities within a radius of 50 km;2. in the course of shuttle services, no passenger may be taken up or set down during the journey;3. the first return journey and the last outward journey in a series of shuttles shall be made unladen;4. however, the classification of a transport operation as a shuttle service shall not be affected by the fact that, with the agreement of the competent authorities in the Contracting Party or Parties concerned:- passengers, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 1, make the return journey with another group or another transport operator,- passengers, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 2, are taken up or set down along the way,- the first outward journey and the last return journey of the series of shuttles are, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 3, made unladen;6. \"Contracting Parties\" are those signatories that have consented to be bound by this Agreement and for which this Agreement is in force.This Agreement applies to those territories where the Treaty establishing the European Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and to BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, BULGARIA, CROATIA, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, ESTONIA, HUNGARY, LATVIA, LITHUANIA, MOLDOVA, POLAND, ROMANIA, SLOVAKIA, SLOVENIA and TURKEY, as far as they have concluded this Agreement;7. \"competent authorities\" are those authorities designated by the Member States of the Community and by the other Contracting Parties to carry out the tasks set out in sections V, VI, VII, VIII and IX of this Agreement;8. \"transit\" means the part of a transport operation through the territory of a Contracting Party without passengers being picked up or set down.SECTION IICONDITIONS APPLYING TO ROAD PASSENGER TRANSPORT OPERATORSArticle 41. Contracting Parties which have not yet done so shall apply provisions equivalent to those established by the European Community Directive referred to in Annex 1.2. Concerning the condition on the appropriate financial standing referred to in Article 3(3) of such Directive, Contracting Parties may apply a minimum available capital and reserves lower than the amount established in point (c) of the said paragraph 3, up to the date of 1 January 2003 or even to 1 January 2005 under condition in the latter case that a corresponding declaration be made at the time of the ratification of the Agreement, without prejudice to the provisions included in the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States and certain Contracting Parties to the present Agreement.SECTION IIITECHNICAL CONDITIONS APPLYING TO VEHICLESArticle 5The buses and coaches used to carry out the international occasional services covered by this Agreement shall comply with the technical standards laid down in Annex 2.SECTION IVACCESS TO THE MARKETArticle 6Liberalised occasional servicesThe following occasional services shall be exempted from authorisation on the territory of any Contracting Party other than that in which the transport operator is established:1. closed-door tours, that is to say services whereby the same bus or coach is used to carry the same group of passengers throughout the journey and to bring them back to the place of departure. The place of departure is in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;2. services which make the outward journey laden and the return journey unladen. The place of departure is in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;3. services during which the outward journey is made unladen and all the passengers are taken up in the same place, provided that one of the following conditions is met:(a) passengers constitute groups, on the territory of a non-Contracting Party or of a Contracting Party other than that in which the transport operator is established or that where the passengers are taken up, that have been formed under contracts of carriage made before their arrival in the territory of the latter Contracting Party. Passengers are carried on the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;(b) passengers have been previously brought, by the same transport operator in the circumstances provided for under point 2, into the territory of the Contracting Party where they are taken up again and carried into the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;(c) passengers have been invited to travel into the territory of another Contracting Party, the cost of transport being borne by the person issuing the invitation. Such passengers must constitute a homogeneous group, which has not been formed solely with a view to undertaking that particular journey and which is brought into the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established.The following shall also be exempted from authorisation:4. transit operations through the territory of Contracting Parties in conjunction with occasional services that are exempted from authorisation;5. unladen buses and coaches to be used exclusively for the replacement of a bus or a coach damaged or broken down, while performing an international service covered by this Agreement.For services provided by transport operators established within the European Community, the points of departure and/or destination of the services can be in any Member State of the European Community, independently of the Member State in which the bus or coach is registered or the Member State in which the transport operator is established.Article 7Non-liberalised occasional services1. Occasional services other than those referred to in Article 6 shall be subject to authorisation in accordance with Article 15.2. For services provided by transport operators established within the European Community, the points of departure and/or destination of the services can be in any Member State of the European Community, independently of the Member State in which the bus or coach is registered or the Member State in which the transport operator is established.SECTION VSOCIAL PROVISIONSArticle 8The Contracting Parties to this Agreement which have not yet done so shall accede to the European Agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport (AETR) of 1 July 1970, as subsequently amended, or shall apply Community regulation 3820/85 regulation 3821/85 as in force at the entry into force of this Agreement.SECTION VICUSTOM AND FISCAL PROVISIONSArticle 91. Buses and coaches that are engaged in transport operations in accordance with this Agreement shall be exempted from all vehicle taxes and charges levied on the circulation or possession of vehicles as well as from all special taxes or charges levied on transport operations in the territory of the other Contracting Parties.Buses and coaches shall not be exempted from payment of taxes and charges on motor fuel, value added tax on transport services, road tolls and user charges levied on the use of infrastructure.2. Contracting Parties shall ensure that tolls and any other form of user charges may not be imposed at the same time for the use of a single road section. However, Contracting Parties may also impose tolls on networks where user charges are levied, for the use of bridges, tunnels and mountain passes.3. The fuel for buses and coaches, contained in the fuel tanks established by the manufacturer for this purpose, and in any case not more than 600 litres, as well as the lubricants contained in buses and coaches for the sole purpose of their operation, shall be exempted from import duties and any other taxes and payments imposed in other Contracting Parties.4. The Joint Committee established in Article 23 will draft a list of the taxes concerning road transport of passengers by bus and coach levied in each Contracting Party. This list will indicate the taxes falling under the provisions of paragraph 1, first subparagraph, of this Article that can only be levied in the Contracting Party of registration of the vehicle. This list will also indicate the taxes falling under the provisions of paragraph 1, second subparagraph, of this Article that may be levied in Contracting Parties other than the Contracting Party of registration of the vehicle. Contracting Parties which replace any tax included in the lists referred to with another tax of the same or a different kind shall notify the Joint Committee in order to make the necessary amendments.5. Spare parts and tools imported for the repair of a damaged bus or coach while performing an international road transport operation shall be exempted from customs duty and from all taxes and charges at the time of importation into the territory of the other Contracting Party under the conditions laid down in its provisions concerning temporary admission of such goods.

As well as simple functional checks (lighting, signalling, tyre condition, etc.), specific tests and/or inspections shall be carried out on the vehicle's brakes and the motor vehicle's emissions in the following manner:1. BrakesEvery part of the braking system and its means of operation shall be maintained in good and efficient working order and be properly adjusted.The bus or coach's brakes shall be capable of performing the following three braking functions:(a) for buses and coaches and their trailers and semi-trailers, a service brake capable of slowing down the vehicle and of stopping it safely, rapidly and efficiently, whatever its conditions of loading and whatever the upward or downward gradient of the road on which it is moving;(b) for buses and coaches and their trailers and semi-trailers, a parking brake capable of holding the bus or coach stationary, whatever its condition of loading, on a noticeable upward or downward gradient, the operative surfaces of the brake being held in the braking position by a device whose action is purely mechanical;(c) for buses and coaches, a secondary (emergency) brake capable of slowing down and stopping the bus or coach, whatever its condition of loading, within a reasonable distance, even in the event of failure of the service brake.Where the maintenance condition of the bus or coach is in doubt, the inspection authorities may test the bus' or coach's braking performance in accordance with some or all of the provisions of directive 96/96/ec Annex II(I).2. Exhaust emissions2.1. Exhaust emission2.1.1. Buses and coaches equipped with positive-ignition (petrol) engines(a) Where the exhaust emissions are not controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter which is lambda-probe controlled:1. visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that there is no leakage;2. if appropriate, visual inspection of the emission control system in order to check that the required equipment has been fitted.After a reasonable period of engine conditioning (taking account of the bus or coach manufacturer's recommendations) the carbon monoxide (CO) content of the exhaust gases is measured when the engine is idling (no load).The maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the bus or coach manufacturer. Where this information is not available or where Member States' competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference value, the CO content must not exceed the following:- for buses and coaches registered or put into service for the first time between the date from which Contracting Parties required the buses and coaches to comply with directive 70/220/eec(1) and 1 October 1986: CO - 4,5 % vol,- for buses and coaches registered or put into service for the first time after 1 October 1986: CO - 3,5 % vol.(b) Where the exhaust emissions are controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter which is lambda-probe controlled:1. visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that there are no leakages and that all parts are complete;2. visual inspection of the emission control system in order to check that the required equipment has been fitted;3. determination of the efficiency of the bus or coach's emission control system by measuring the lambda value and the CO content of the exhaust gases in accordance with Section 4 or with the procedures proposed by the manufacturers and approved at the time of type-approval. For each of the tests, the engine is conditioned in accordance with the bus or coach manufacturer's recommendations;4. exhaust pipe emissions - limit values:measurement at engine idling speed:the maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the bus or coach manufacturer. Where this information is not available, the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,5 % volMeasurement at high idle speed, engine speed to be at least 2000 min-1:CO content: maximum 0,3 % vollambda: 1 ± 0,03 in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.2.1.2. Buses and coaches equipped with compression ignition (diesel) enginesMeasurement of exhaust gas opacity with free acceleration (no load from idling up to cut-off speed). The level of concentration must not exceed the level recorded on the plate pursuant to directive 72/306/eec(2). Where this information is not available or where Contracting Parties' competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference, the limit values of the coefficient of absorption are as follows:maximum coefficient of absorption for:- naturally aspirated diesel engines = 2,5 m-1,- turbo-charged diesel engines = 3,0 m-1or equivalent values where use is made of equipment of a type different from that used for EC type-approval.2.1.3. Test equipmentBuses' and coaches' emissions are tested using equipment designed to establish accurately whether the limit values prescribed or indicated by the manufacturer have been complied with.2.2.
