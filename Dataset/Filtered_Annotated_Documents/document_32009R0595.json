{"celex_id": "32009R0595", "reference": "18.7.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 188/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 595/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 18 June 2009\non type-approval of motor vehicles and engines with respect to emissions from heavy duty vehicles (Euro VI) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information and amending Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and Directive 2007/46/EC and repealing Directives 80/1269/EEC, 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To that end a comprehensive Community type-approval system for motor vehicles is in place. The technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to emissions should therefore be harmonised to avoid requirements that differ from one Member State to another and to ensure a high level of environmental protection.\n(2)\nThis Regulation is a new separate regulation in the context of the Community type-approval procedure under Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive) (3). Therefore, Annexes IV, VI and XI to that Directive should be amended accordingly.\n(3)\nFollowing the request of the European Parliament, a new regulatory approach has been introduced in Community vehicle legislation. This Regulation should therefore lay down only fundamental provisions on vehicle emissions, whereas the technical specifications should be laid down by implementing measures adopted under the comitology procedures.\n(4)\nThe Sixth Community Environment Action Programme adopted by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 (4) establishes the need to reduce pollution to levels which minimise harmful effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations and to the environment as a whole. Community legislation has established appropriate standards for ambient air quality for the protection of human health and sensitive individuals in particular, as well as for national emission ceilings. Following its communication of 4 May 2001, which established the ‘Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) programme’, the Commission adopted another communication on 21 September 2005 entitled ‘Thematic strategy for air pollution’. One of the conclusions of that thematic strategy is that further reductions in emissions from the transport sector (air, maritime and land transport), from households and from the energy, agricultural and industrial sectors are needed to achieve EU air quality objectives. In this context, the task of reducing vehicle emissions should be approached as part of an overall strategy. The Euro VI standards are one of the measures designed to reduce the actual in-use emissions of air pollutants such as particulate pollutants (PM) as well as ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbons.\n(5)\nAchieving EU air quality objectives requires a continuous effort to reduce vehicle emissions. For that reason, industry should be provided with clear information on future emission limit values and should be allowed an appropriate period of time in which to attain them and pursue the requisite technical developments.\n(6)\nIn particular, a reduction in NOx emissions from heavy duty vehicles is necessary to improve air quality and comply with limit values for pollution and national emission ceilings. Setting limit values for NOx emissions at an early stage should provide long-term, European Union-wide planning certainty for vehicle manufacturers.\n(7)\nIn setting emission standards it is important to take into account the implications for competitiveness of markets and manufacturers, the direct and indirect costs imposed on business and the benefits that accrue in terms of stimulating innovation, improving air quality, reducing health costs and increasing life expectancy.\n(8)\nUnrestricted access to vehicle repair information, via a standardised format which can be used to retrieve the technical information, and effective competition on the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services are necessary to improve the functioning of the internal market, particularly as regards the free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. A great proportion of such information is related to on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems and their interaction with other vehicle systems. It is necessary to lay down technical specifications to be followed by the manufacturers concerning the provision of information on their websites, along with targeted measures to ensure reasonable access for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n(9)\nNot later than 7 August 2013, the Commission should review the operation of the system of unrestricted access to vehicle repair and maintenance information with a view to determining whether it would be appropriate to consolidate all provisions governing access to vehicle repair and maintenance information within the revised framework legislation on type-approval. If the provisions governing access to such information are consolidated in this way, the corresponding provisions of this Regulation should be repealed, as long as existing rights of access to repair and maintenance information are preserved.\n(10)\nThe Commission should encourage the development of an international standard format for unrestricted and standardised access to vehicle repair and maintenance information, for example through the work of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN).\n(11)\nIt is essential to establish a common European standard for the format of vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information. Until such time as that standard is adopted, vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information for heavy duty vehicles should be presented in a readily accessible manner and in a format guaranteeing non-discriminatory access. The information should be made available on the websites of manufacturers, or, if this is not feasible due to the nature of the information, in another appropriate format.\n(12)\nThe Commission should keep under review emissions which are, as yet, unregulated and which arise as a consequence of the wider use of new fuel formulations, engine technologies and emission control systems. The Commission should also, where necessary, submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council with a view to regulating such emissions.\n(13)\nIt is appropriate to encourage the introduction of alternative fuel vehicles, which can have low NOx and particulate emissions. Thus, limit values for hydrocarbons, non-methane hydrocarbons and methane should be introduced.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure that emissions of ultrafine particulate pollutants (PM 0,1 μm and below) are controlled, the Commission should be empowered to adopt a number-based approach to emissions of particulate pollutants in addition to the mass-based approach which is currently used. The number-based approach to emissions of particles should draw on the results of the Particulate measurement programme (PMP) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) and be consistent with the existing ambitious objectives for the environment.\n(15)\nIn order to achieve these environmental objectives, it is appropriate to indicate that the particle number limits are likely to reflect the highest levels of performance currently obtained with particle filters by using the best available technology.\n(16)\nThe Commission should adopt worldwide harmonised driving cycles in the test procedure that provides the basis for EC type-approval emissions regulations. The application of portable emissions measurement systems for verifying the actual in-use emissions and the introduction of procedures to control off-cycle emissions should also be considered.\n(17)\nRetrofitting heavy duty vehicles with diesel particle filters could result in higher nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions. As part of the thematic strategy on air pollution, the Commission should therefore draft a legislative proposal to harmonise national legislation on retrofitting and ensure that it incorporates environmental conditions.\n(18)\nOBD systems are important to control emissions during the use of a vehicle. Due to the importance of controlling real-world emissions, the Commission should keep under review the requirements for such systems and the tolerance thresholds for monitoring faults.\n(19)\nIn order to monitor the contribution of this sector, as a whole, to the global emissions of greenhouse gases, the Commission should introduce the measuring of fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of heavy duty vehicles.\n(20)\nIn order to promote the market for clean and energy efficient vehicles, the Commission should study the feasibility and the development of a definition and a methodology of energy consumption and CO2 emissions for whole vehicles and not only for engines, without prejudice to the use of virtual and actual testing. Such a definition and the methodology should also cover alternative driveline concepts (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the effects of improvements on vehicles such as aerodynamics, weight, loading capacity and rolling resistance. If a suitable method of presentation and comparison can be identified, the derived fuel consumption and CO2 emissions should be made publicly available for separate vehicle types.\n(21)\nIn order to better control actual in-use emissions including off-cycle emissions and to facilitate the in-service conformity process, a testing methodology and performance requirements based on the use of portable emission measurement systems should be adopted within an appropriate timeframe.\n(22)\nWith a view to meeting EU air quality objectives, the Commission should introduce harmonised provisions to ensure that off-cycle emissions from heavy duty engines and vehicles are appropriately controlled over a broad range of engine and ambient operating conditions.\n(23)\nThe correct functioning of the after-treatment system, and more specifically in the case of NOx, is the basic requirement for fulfilling the established standards for pollutant emissions. In this context, measures to guarantee the proper operation of systems relying on the use of a reagent should be introduced.\n(24)\nMember States are able, by means of financial incentives, to accelerate the placing on the market of vehicles which satisfy the requirements adopted at Community level. This Regulation should not affect the right of Member States to include emissions in the method for calculating taxes levied on vehicles.\n(25)\nWhen Member States draw up measures to ensure retrofitting of existing heavy duty vehicles, such measures should be based on the Euro VI standards.\n(26)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(27)\nThe requirements of engine power of motor vehicles contained in Council Directive 80/1269/EEC of 16 December 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the engine power of motor vehicles (5) should be introduced in this Regulation and in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2007 on type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information (6). Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 should be amended accordingly and Directive 80/1269/EEC should be repealed.\n(28)\nIn order to simplify Community legislation, it is appropriate to replace the existing heavy duty vehicles emissions legislation, namely Directive 2005/55/EC (7) and Commission Directive 2005/78/EC (8), by a regulation. The use of a regulation should ensure that the detailed technical provisions are directly applicable to manufacturers, approval authorities and technical services and that they can be updated in a fast and efficient way. Therefore Directives 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC should be repealed and Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 should be amended accordingly.\n(29)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9).\n(30)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to introduce particle number based limit values in Annex I, to specify, if appropriate, the value of the admissible level of the NO2 component in the NOx limit value, to establish specific procedures, tests and requirements for type-approval, as well as a particle number measurement procedure, and to adopt measures concerning off-cycle emissions, the use of portable emissions measurement systems, access to vehicle repair and maintenance information and test cycles used to measure emissions. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(31)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the realisation of the internal market through the introduction of common technical requirements concerning emissions from motor vehicles and guaranteed access to vehicle repair and maintenance information for independent operators on the same basis as for authorised dealers and repairers, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes common technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles, engines and replacement parts with regard to their emissions.\nThis Regulation also lays down rules for in-service conformity of vehicles and engines, durability of pollution control devices, OBD systems, measurement of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions and accessibility of vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation shall apply to motor vehicles of categories M1, M2, N1 and N2 as defined in Annex II of Directive 2007/46/EC with a reference mass exceeding 2 610 kg and to all motor vehicles of categories M3 and N3, as defined in that Annex.\nThis Regulation shall apply without prejudice to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007.\nAt the request of the manufacturer, the type-approval of a completed vehicle granted under this Regulation and its implementing measures shall be extended to its incomplete vehicle with a reference mass not exceeding 2 610 kg.

With effect from 31 December 2012, national authorities shall refuse, on grounds relating to emissions, to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval in respect of new types of vehicles or engines which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.\nType-approval technical certificates corresponding to the emission stages prior to Euro VI may be granted to vehicles and engines intended for export to third countries, provided such certificates clearly state that the vehicles and engines in question cannot be placed on the Community market.\n2.   With effect from 31 December 2013, national authorities shall, in the case of new vehicles which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures, consider certificates of conformity to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 26 of Directive 2007/46/EC and shall, on grounds relating to emissions, prohibit the registration, sale and entry into service of such vehicles.\nWith effect from the same date and except in the case of replacement engines for in-service vehicles, national authorities shall prohibit the sale or use of new engines which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and subject to entry into force of the implementing measures referred to in Article 4(3), Article 5(4) and in the first subparagraph of Article 6(2), if a manufacturer so requests, national authorities may not, on grounds relating to emissions of vehicles, refuse to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval for a new type of vehicle or engine, or prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of a new vehicle and the sale or use of new engines, where the vehicle or engines concerned comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.\nArticle 9\nObligations of Member States concerning type-approval of replacement parts\nThe sale or installation on a vehicle of new replacement pollution control devices intended to be fitted on vehicles approved under this Regulation and its implementing measures shall be prohibited if they are not of a type in respect of which a type-approval has been granted in compliance with this Regulation and its implementing measures.\nArticle 10\nFinancial incentives\n1.   Subject to the entry into force of the implementing measures to this Regulation, Member States may provide for financial incentives that apply to motor vehicles in series production, which comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.\nThose incentives shall apply to all new vehicles put on the market of the Member State concerned, which comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures. However, they shall cease to apply on 31 December 2013 at the latest.\n2.   Subject to the entry into force of the implementing measures to this Regulation, Member States may grant financial incentives for retrofitting in order to meet the emission limit values set out in Annex I of in-use vehicles and for scrapping vehicles which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.\n3.   For each type of motor vehicle, the financial incentives referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not exceed the additional cost of the technical devices used to ensure compliance with the emission limits specified in Annex I, including the cost of installation on the vehicle.\n4.   The Commission shall be informed of plans to institute or change the financial incentives referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.\nArticle 11\nPenalties\n1.   Member States shall lay down the provisions on penalties applicable for infringement of the provisions of this Regulation and its implementing measures and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Member States shall notify those provisions to the Commission by 7 February 2011 and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.\n2.   The types of infringements by manufacturers which are subject to a penalty shall include:\n(a)\nmaking false declarations during the approval procedures or procedures leading to a recall;\n(b)\nfalsifying test results for type-approval or in-service conformity;\n(c)\nwithholding data or technical specifications which could lead to recall or withdrawal of type-approval;\n(d)\nuse of defeat strategies;\n(e)\nrefusal to provide access to information.\nThe types of infringements by manufacturers, repairers and operators of the vehicles which are subject to a penalty shall include tampering with systems which control NOx emissions. This shall include, for example, tampering with systems which use a consumable reagent.\nThe types of infringements committed by operators of the vehicles which are subject to a penalty shall include driving a vehicle without a consumable reagent.\nArticle 12\nRedefinition of specifications\n1.   After the completion of the relevant parts of the PMP of the UN/ECE, conducted under the auspices of the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations, the Commission shall, without lowering the level of environmental protection within the Community:\n(a)\nintroduce as an additional control upon emissions of particulate matter particle number based limit values set at a level appropriate to the technologies actually being used at that time to meet the particulate mass limit;\n(b)\nadopt a measurement procedure for particle number.\nThe Commission shall also, without lowering the level of environmental protection within the Community, specify a limit value for emissions of NO2 in addition to that for total emissions of NOx, if appropriate. The limit for emissions of NO2 shall be set at a level reflecting the performance of then existing technologies.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(2).\n2.   The Commission shall establish correlation factors between the European transient cycle (ETC) and the European steady state cycle (ESC) as described in Directive 2005/55/EC, and the worldwide harmonised transient driving cycle (WHTC) and the worldwide harmonised steady state driving cycle (WHSC) and shall adapt the limit values to that effect. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(2).\n3.   The Commission shall keep under review the procedures, tests and requirements referred to in Article 5(4) as well as the test cycles used to measure emissions.\nIf the review finds that those procedures, tests, requirements and test cycles are no longer adequate or no longer reflect actual world emissions, they shall be adapted so as to adequately reflect the emissions generated by real driving on the road. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(2).\n4.   The Commission shall keep under review the pollutants listed in point 2 of Article 3. If the Commission concludes that it is appropriate to regulate the emissions of additional pollutants, it shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a proposal for amending this Regulation.\nArticle 13\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Technical Committee — Motor Vehicles (TCMV) established by Article 40(1) of Directive 2007/46/EC.\n2.

VI): certification rules\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 595/2009 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines (with respect to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information)\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt defines the rules for type approval* of motor vehicles, engines and replacement parts for heavy-duty vehicles (lorries, buses and coaches) with respect to their emission performance. It also sets out rules on: in-service conformity of vehicles and engines;durability of pollution-control devices;on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems;accessibility of vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information;measurement of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.\nIt repeals Directives 80/1269/EEC, 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC with effect from 31 December 2013.\nRegulation (EU) 2018/858 (see summary), which has applied from 1 September 2020, amends Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 by removing the references regarding access to vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThis regulation applies to motor vehicles of categories M1, M2, N1 and N2 with a reference mass exceeding 2 610 kg, and to all motor vehicles of categories M3 and N3, as defined in Regulation (EU) 2018/858.\nManufacturer obligations\nManufacturers must:\nbe able to demonstrate that all new vehicles, engines or spare parts sold, registered or put into service in the EU have been type-approved in accordance with this regulation;\ntake technical measures to guarantee effective limitation of exhaust emissions throughout the normal life of the vehicles under normal conditions of use.\nRequirements and tests\nManufacturers must equip their vehicles or engines with components that they comply with the emission limits laid down in Annex I of this regulation under conditions specified by the European Commission in this regulation and in the implementing acts.\nAccess to information\nManufacturers must: guarantee independent operators (i.e. businesses which are independent from authorised dealers and repairers of a given vehicle brand) access to information on OBD systems and on diagnostic equipment, tools or software;provide a standardised, secure and remote facility to enable independent repairers to complete operations which involve access to the vehicle security system.\nThe information should be made available on manufacturers' websites, or, if this is not feasible, in another appropriate format.\nFrom 1 September 2020, all rules relating to vehicle repair and maintenance information will be found in Chapter XIV of Regulation (EU) 2018/858.\nTimetable\nNational authorities must not lgrant EU or national type approval for vehicles that do not comply with this regulation from 31 December 2012, and must prohibit the registration of new vehicles that do not comply with this regulation from 31 December 2013.\nFinancial incentives\nCountries could grant financial incentives for the purchase of motor vehicles produced in series which comply with this regulation until 31 December 2013. Retrofitting measures may also be considered either to adapt in-use motor vehicles or for scrapping.\nThe amount of the financial incentives must be equal to the additional cost of the technical measures introduced to ensure compliance of the vehicle with emission limits.\nImplementing legislation\nImplementing acts set out measures to implement Regulation (EC) No 595/2009:\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 582/2011 sets out the specific technical requirements for the approval of heavy-duty vehicles with regard to emissions and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. It has been amended several times and covers aspects such as: arrangements to ensure that vehicle OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information is accessible in a non-discriminatory manner and that training material is available to independent operators and authorised dealers and repairers;rules regarding multi-stage type-approval, customer adaptations, small volume manufacturers, carry-over systems and fees for access to vehicle repair and maintenance information;extending the scope of the Forum on Access to Vehicle Information’s activities to vehicles covered by Regulation (EC) No 595/2009;a requirement to ensure all engine systems and vehicles are equipped with an OBD system;conformity of production;in-service conformity;remedial measures in the event of non-compliance;requirements to limit off-cycle emissions;pollution-control devices;detailed requirements for type approval;rules for EC type approval of: an engine system or engine family* as a separate technical unit with regard to emissions and access to repair and maintenance information,a vehicle with regard to emissions and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information,a type of replacement pollution-control device as a separate technical unit.\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 (see summary) complements the legal rules established by Regulation (EU) No 582/2011. It lays down the rules for: certifying lorry components with an impact on CO2 emissions and the fuel consumption of vehicles;issuing licences to perform simulations to determine CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of new vehicles to be sold, registered or put into service in the EU;using simulation tools and declaring the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption values that they determine.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 7 August 2009. However, some of the amendments to Directive 2007/46/EC included in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 have only applied since 31 December 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nReducing CO2 emissions from Heavy-Duty Vehicles (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nType-approval: the procedure whereby an approval authority certifies that a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit satisfies certain legal requirements.\nEngine family: manufacturer’s grouping of engine types which, through their design, havesimilar exhaust emission characteristics, and respect the applicable emissionlimit values.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 595/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines with respect to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (Euro VI) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information and amending Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and Directive 2007/46/EC and repealing Directives 80/1269/EEC, 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC (OJ L 188, 18.7.2009, pp. 1-13)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
