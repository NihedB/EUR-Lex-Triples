With this Council Decision, the convention is approved on behalf of the Community.\nThe convention lays down a set of measures to protect human beings and the environment against the transboundary effects of industrial accidents, and to promote active international cooperation between the contracting parties before, during and after such accidents.\nIt applies to industrial accidents capable of causing transboundary effects, including accidents caused by natural disasters, with the exception of:\nnuclear accidents or radiological emergencies;\naccidents at military installations;\ndam failures;\nland-based transport accidents;\nthe accidental release of genetically modified organisms;\naccidents caused by activities in the marine environment and the spillage of harmful substances at sea.\nThe contracting parties must identify hazardous activities within their jurisdiction and must inform the affected parties of any such proposed or existing activity. At the initiative of any one of them, the other parties must enter into discussions on the identification of activities capable of causing transboundary effects.\nThe signatory states must take appropriate measures to prevent industrial accidents. In particular they must:\ninduce action by operators to reduce the risk of industrial accidents;\nestablish policies on the siting of new hazardous activities and on significant modifications to existing hazardous activities, with the objective of minimising the risk to the population and the environment;\nprepare for emergencies caused by industrial accidents, introducing the necessary measures, including contingency plans, to prevent and minimise transboundary effects. The signatories must endeavour to make their plans compatible.\nUnder the convention, the contracting states must ensure that adequate information is given to the public in the areas capable of being affected by an industrial accident arising out of a hazardous activity. The contracting states must also, in appropriate cases, give the public an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process concerning prevention and preparedness measures.\nNatural or legal persons who are, or may be, affected by the transboundary effects of an industrial accident in the territory of a signatory state must be given the same access to the relevant administrative and judicial proceedings as a national of the state concerned.\nEach party to the convention must introduce a system of notification.\nIn the event or imminent threat of an industrial accident causing or capable of causing transboundary effects, the state of origin must:\nnotify the affected states without delay;\nensure that the contingency plans are activated;\nensure that the response measures are taken as swiftly as possible so as to contain and minimise the effects of the accident.
