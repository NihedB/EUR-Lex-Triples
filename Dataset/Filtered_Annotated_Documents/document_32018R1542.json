On 28 June 2018, the European Council called for the adoption as soon as possible of a new Union regime of restrictive measures to address the use and proliferation of chemical weapons.\n(2)\nOn 15 October 2018 the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544 concerning restrictive measures against the proliferation and use of chemical weapons. The Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544 provides for travel restrictions and the freezing of funds and economic resources of certain persons, entities or bodies that are responsible for, provide financial, technical or material support for, or are otherwise involved in, manufacturing or using chemical weapons or engaging in preparations for the use of chemical weapons, as well as those who assist or encourage such activities. Those persons, entities and bodies are listed in the Annex to Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544.\n(3)\nFurther action by the Union is needed in order to implement certain provisions of Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544.\n(4)\nThe High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission should make a proposal for a Regulation concerning restrictive measures against the proliferation and use of chemical weapons.\n(5)\nThis Regulation supports the 2003 EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, as well as the international framework regarding the proliferation of chemical weapons: the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (‘CWC’), the Decision of the Conference of the States Parties to the CWC addressing the threat from chemical weapons use, adopted on 27 June 2018, the Australia Group, ‘the Proliferation Security Initiative’ and the International Partnership against the Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons. This Regulation also supports the implementation of relevant UNSC Resolutions, notably Resolutions 1540 (2004), 2118 (2013), 2209 (2015), 2235 (2015) and 2325 (2016).\n(6)\nThis Regulation contributes to the Union's efforts to tackle the proliferation and use of chemical weapons and to the Union's efforts to support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and its Technical Secretariat. The scope of chemical weapons referred to in this Regulation is based on the scope and definition provided for by the CWC.\n(7)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and the right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation should be applied in accordance with those rights.\n(8)\nThe power to establish and amend the list in Annex I to this Regulation should be exercised by the Council in order to ensure consistency with the process for establishing, amending and reviewing the Annex to Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544.\n(9)\nFor the implementation of this Regulation, and in order to ensure maximum legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data concerning natural and legal persons, entities and bodies whose funds and economic resources must be frozen in accordance with this Regulation should be made public. Any processing of personal data should comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).\n(10)\nMember States and the Commission should inform each other of the measures taken pursuant to this Regulation and should inform each other of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation.\n(11)\nMember States should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and make sure that they are implemented. Those sanctions should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(12)\nIn order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, it should enter into force immediately upon its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘chemical weapons’ means chemical weapons as defined in Article II of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC);\n(b)\n‘claim’ means any claim, whether asserted by legal proceedings or not, made before or after the date of entry into force of this Regulation, under or in connection with a contract or transaction, and includes in particular:\n(i)\na claim for performance of any obligation arising under or in connection with a contract or transaction;\n(ii)\na claim for extension or payment of a bond, financial guarantee or indemnity of whatever form;\n(iii)\na claim for compensation in respect of a contract or transaction;\n(iv)\na counterclaim;\n(v)\na claim for the recognition or enforcement, including by the procedure of exequatur, of a judgment, an arbitration award or an equivalent decision, wherever made or given;\n(c)\n‘contract or transaction’ means any transaction of whatever form and whatever the applicable law, whether comprising one or more contracts or similar obligations made between the same or different parties; for this purpose ‘contract’ includes a bond, guarantee or indemnity, particularly a financial guarantee or financial indemnity, and credit, whether legally independent or not, as well as any related provision arising under, or in connection with, the transaction;\n(d)\n‘competent authorities’ refers to the competent authorities of the Member States as identified on the websites listed in Annex II;\n(e)\n‘economic resources’ means assets of any kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, which are not funds, but may be used to obtain funds, goods or services;\n(f)\n‘freezing of economic resources’ means preventing the use of economic resources to obtain funds, goods or services in any way, including, but not limited to, by selling, hiring or mortgaging them;\n(g)\n‘freezing of funds’ means preventing any move, transfer, alteration, use of, access to, or dealing with funds in any way that would result in any change in their volume, amount, location, ownership, possession, character, destination or other change that would enable the funds to be used, including portfolio management;\n(h)\n‘funds’ means financial assets and benefit of every kind, including, but not limited to:\n(i)\ncash, cheques, claims on money, drafts, money orders and other payment instruments;\n(ii)\ndeposits with financial institutions or other entities, balances on accounts, debts and debt obligations;\n(iii)\npublicly- or privately-traded securities and debt instruments, including stocks and shares, certificates representing securities, bonds, notes, warrants, debentures and derivatives contracts;\n(iv)\ninterest, dividends or other income on or value accruing from or generated by assets;\n(v)\ncredit, right of set-off, guarantees, performance bonds or other financial commitments;\n(vi)\nletters of credit, bills of lading, bills of sale; and\n(vii)\ndocuments showing evidence of an interest in funds or financial resources;\n(i)\n‘territory of the Union’ means the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in the Treaty, including their airspace.\nArticle 2\n1.

proliferation and use of chemical weapons\nSUMMARY OF:\nDecision (CFSP) 2018/1544 — restrictive measures against the proliferation and use of chemical weapons\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1542 — restrictive measures against the proliferation and use of chemical weapons\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION AND THE DECISION?\n              \nTogether, the decision (adopted in the context of the EU’s common foreign and security policy) and the regulation (adopted on the basis of Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)) introduce a new ‘thematic’ EU sanctions regime, to counter the threat posed by the use and proliferation of chemical weapons*.\nThe decision obliges EU countries to impose an EU-wide travel ban and provides for an asset freeze targeting individuals, entities or bodies involved in the development and use of chemical weapons.\nThe regulation implements those measures falling under the TFEU, in particular the asset freeze.\nThese measures contribute to the EU’s efforts to tackle the proliferation and use of chemical weapons and its efforts to support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and its Technical Secretariat.\nKEY POINTS\nDecision (CFSP) 2018/1544\nThe decision requires EU countries to prevent entry to or transit through their territory of target persons and entities who are directly responsible for the development and use of chemical weapons, as well as those who provide financial, technical or material support, and those who assist, encourage or are associated with them.\nSome exceptions are permitted including, for example:\nan EU country is not obliged to refuse its own nationals entry to its territory;\nan EU country which is bound by an obligation of international law, such as being a host of an international intergovernmental organisation;\nan EU country that is host country of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nEU countries must freeze any funds and economic resources* belonging to, held or controlled by target persons or entities. Exceptionally, they may authorise the release of some of these funds if, for example, they are necessary:\nfor the basic needs of the target individual or entity;\nto pay for legal services;\nto pay fees or service charges for the routine holding or maintenance of the frozen funds or economic resources;\nto satisfy a court or arbitral decision that predates the asset freeze.\nEU countries must notify the other EU countries and the European Commission in these cases.\nThe Council is responsible for drawing up and amending the list of target individuals and entities in the annex to the decision. The Council acts by unanimity based on a proposal either from an EU country or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\nThe Council then communicates its decision to the targeted individual(s) or entity(ies) either directly (if their address is known) or indirectly through the publication of a notice.\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1542\nThe regulation:\ncomplements the decision and sets out a series of definitions;\nrequires that all funds and economic resources belonging to, held or controlled by any target individual or body identified by the Council and listed in Annex I be frozen;\nsets out the exceptional instances where certain frozen funds may be released and the conditions to be met — see above in regard to Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544.\nFinancial or credit institutions that receive funds transferred by third parties to the account of a listed individual or body may credit the frozen accounts, but any additions to such accounts will also be frozen. The institution must inform the relevant competent authority about any such transaction without delay.\nThe freezing of funds and economic resources or the refusal to make funds or economic resources available, carried out in good faith on the basis that such action is in line with this regulation, must not give rise to liability of any kind on the part of the individual or body implementing it, or its directors or employees, unless it is proved that the funds and economic resources were frozen or withheld as a result of negligence.\nAny knowing or intentional involvement in activities to circumvent the measures (travel ban and/or asset freeze) is prohibited.\nThe regulation applies:\nwithin the EU territory, including its airspace;\non board any aircraft or any vessel under the jurisdiction of an EU country;\nto any individual inside or outside the territory of the EU who is a national of an EU country;\nto any individual or body, inside or outside the EU territory, which is incorporated or constituted under the law of an EU country;\nto any legal person, entity or body in respect of any business done in whole or in part within the EU.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nThe decision and regulation have applied since 16 October 2018.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe new regime of restrictive measures, or sanctions, was adopted by the EU on 15 October 2018 as a follow-up to the conclusions of the June 2018 European Council, which called for the adoption as soon as possible of a new EU regime of restrictive measures to address the use and proliferation of chemical weapons.\nThe first sanctions under the new regime were introduced in January 2019 resulting in the amendment of the decision and regulation (see ‘Related documents’).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nChemical weapons: chemical weapons as defined in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), are the following, taken together or separately:(a) toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where intended for purposes not prohibited under this Convention, as long as the types and quantities are consistent with such purposes;(b) munitions and devices, specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of those toxic chemicals specified in subparagraph (a), which would be released as a result of the employment of such munitions and devices;(c) any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of munitions and devices specified in subparagraph (b).\nEconomic resources: assets of any kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, which are not funds, but may be used to obtain funds, goods or services.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544 of 15 October 2018 concerning restrictive measures against the proliferation and use of chemical weapons (OJ L 259, 16.10.2018, pp. 25-30)\nSuccessive amendments to Council Decision (CFSP) 2018/1544 have been incorporated in the original text.
