Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 applies, the Community or Montenegro, shall supply the Stabilisation and Association Council with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. The Parties within the Stabilisation and Association Council may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Stabilisation and Association Council, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article on the exportation of the product concerned.4. Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or Montenegro may apply forthwith the precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.5. Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately notified to the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their elimination as soon as circumstances permit.Article 43State monopoliesWith regard to any state monopolies of a commercial character, Montenegro shall ensure that, by the entry into force of this Agreement, no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States of the European Union and Montenegro.Article 44Rules of originExcept if otherwise stipulated in this Agreement, Protocol 3 lays down the rules of origin for the application of the provisions of this Agreement.Article 45Restrictions authorisedThis Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value or the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold and silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.Article 46Failure to provide administrative cooperation1. The Parties agree that administrative cooperation is essential for the implementation and the control of the preferential treatment granted under this Title and underline their commitment to combat irregularities and fraud in customs and related matters.2. Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud under this Title, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in accordance with this Article.3. For the purpose of this Article a failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia:(a) a repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned;(b) a repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of subsequent verification of the proof of origin;(c) a repeated refusal or undue delay in obtaining authorisation to conduct administrative cooperation missions to verify the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in question.For the purpose of this Article a finding of irregularities or fraud may be made, inter alia, where there is a rapid increase, without satisfactory explanation, in imports of goods exceeding the usual level of production and export capacity of the other Party, which is linked to objective information concerning irregularities or fraud.4. The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:(a) The Party which has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud shall without undue delay notify the Stabilisation and Association Committee of its finding together with the objective information and enter into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee, on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties.(b) Where the Parties have entered into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee as above and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned. A temporary suspension shall be notified to the Stabilisation and Association Committee without undue delay.(c) Temporary suspensions under this Article shall be limited to that necessary to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed. Temporary suspensions shall be notified immediately after their adoption to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application are no longer given.5. At the same time as the notification to the Stabilisation and Association Committee under paragraph 4(a) of this Article, the Party concerned should publish a notice to importers in its Official Journal. The notice to importers should indicate for the product concerned that there is a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud.Article 47In case of error by the competent authorities in the proper management of the preferential system at export, and in particular in the application of the provisions of Protocol 3 to the present Agreement where this error leads to consequences in terms of import duties, the Contracting Party facing such consequences may request the Stabilisation and Association Council to examine the possibilities of adopting all appropriate measures with a view to resolving the situation.Article 48The application of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands.TITLE VMOVEMENT OF WORKERS, ESTABLISHMENT, SUPPLY OF SERVICES, CAPITALCHAPTER IMovement of workersArticle 491.

The Community and Montenegro undertake, in accordance with the following provisions, to take the necessary steps to allow progressively the supply of services by Community companies, Montenegrin companies or by Community nationals or nationals of Montenegro which are established in the territory of a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.2. In step with the liberalisation process mentioned in paragraph 1, the Parties shall permit the temporary movement of natural persons providing the service or who are employed by the service provider as key personnel as defined in Article 58, including natural persons who are representatives of a Community or Montenegrin company or national and are seeking temporary entry for the purpose of negotiating for the sale of services or entering into agreements to sell services for that service provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves.3. After four years, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall take the measures necessary to progressively implement the provisions of paragraph 1. Account shall be taken of the progress achieved by the Parties in the approximation of their laws.Article 601.

If one Party is of the view that measures introduced by the other Party since the entry into force of this Agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, such first Party may request the other Party to enter into consultations.Article 61With regard to supply of transport services between the Community and Montenegro, the following provisions shall apply:1) With regard to land transport, Protocol 4 lays down the rules applicable to the relationship between the Parties in order to ensure, particularly, unrestricted road transit traffic across Montenegro and the Community as a whole, the effective application of the principle of non-discrimination and progressive harmonisation of the transport legislation of Montenegro with that of the Community.2) With regard to international maritime transport, the Parties undertake to apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to the international maritime markets and trades on a commercial basis, and to respect international and European obligations in the field of safety, security and environmental standards.The Parties affirm their commitment to a freely competitive environment as an essential feature of international maritime transport.3) In applying the principles of paragraph 2, the Parties shall:(a) not introduce cargo-sharing clauses in future bilateral Agreements with third countries;(b) abolish, upon the entry into force of this Agreement, all unilateral measures and administrative, technical and other obstacles that could have restrictive or discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport;(c) Each Party shall grant, inter alia, no less favourable treatment for the ships operated by nationals or companies of the other Party than that accorded to a Party's own ships with regard to access to ports open to international trade, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading.4) With a view to ensuring a coordinated development and progressive liberalisation of transport between the Parties adapted to their reciprocal commercial needs, the conditions of mutual market access in air transport shall be dealt with by the ECAA.5) Prior to the conclusion of the ECAA, the Parties shall not take any measures or actions which are more restrictive or discriminatory as compared with the situation existing prior to the entry into force of this Agreement.6) Montenegro shall adapt its legislation, including administrative, technical and other rules, to that of the Community existing at any time in the field of air, maritime, inland waterway and land transport insofar as it serves liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods.7) In step with the common progress in the achievement of the objectives of this Chapter, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine ways of creating the conditions necessary for improving freedom to provide air, land and inland waterway transport services.CHAPTER IVCurrent payments and movement of capitalArticle 62The Parties undertake to authorise, in freely convertible currency, in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, any payments and transfers on the current account of balance of payments between the Community and Montenegro.Article 631.

Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 62 and of this Article, where, in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital between the Community and Montenegro cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the operation of exchange rate policy or monetary policy in the Community or Montenegro, the Community and Montenegro, respectively, may take safeguard measures with regard to movements of capital between the Community and Montenegro for a period not exceeding six months if such measures are strictly necessary.7. Nothing in the above provisions shall be taken to limit the rights of economic operators of the Parties from benefiting from any more favourable treatment that may be provided for in any existing bilateral or multilateral Agreement involving Parties to this Agreement.8.

The provisions of this Title shall be applied subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.2. They shall not apply to activities that in the territory of any of the Parties are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.Article 66For the purpose of this Title, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parties from applying their laws and regulations regarding entry and stay, employment, working conditions, establishment of natural persons and supply of services, notably insofar as the granting, renewal or refusal of a residence permit is concerned, provided that, in so doing, they do not apply them in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Party under the terms of a specific provision of this Agreement. This provision shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 65.Article 67Companies which are controlled and exclusively owned jointly by Montenegrin companies or nationals of Montenegro and Community companies or nationals shall also be covered by the provisions of this Title.Article 681. The Most-Favoured-Nation treatment granted in accordance with the provisions of this Title shall not apply to the tax advantages that the Parties are providing or will provide in the future on the basis of Agreements designed to avoid double taxation or other tax arrangements.2.

None of the provisions of this Title shall be construed to prevent Member States or Montenegro from applying the relevant provisions of their fiscal legislation, from distinguishing between taxpayers who are not in identical situations, in particular as regards their place of residence.Article 691. The Parties shall endeavour wherever possible to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, for balance of payments purposes. A Party adopting such measures shall present as soon as possible to the other Party a timetable for their removal.2. Where one or more Member States or Montenegro is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Community and Montenegro may, in accordance with the conditions established under the WTO Agreement, adopt restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is strictly necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community and Montenegro shall inform the other Party forthwith.3.

The Parties recognise the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Montenegro to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Montenegro shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Montenegro shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced.2. This approximation shall start on the date of signing of this Agreement, and shall gradually extend to all the elements of the Community acquis referred to in this Agreement by the end of the transitional period defined in Article 8 of this Agreement.3. Approximation will, at an early stage, focus on fundamental elements of the Internal Market acquis, including financial sector legislation, Justice, Freedom and Security as well as on trade-related areas. At a further stage, Montenegro shall focus of the remaining parts of the acquis.Approximation shall be carried out on the basis of a programme to be agreed between the European Commission and Montenegro.4. Montenegro shall also define, in agreement with the European Commission, the modalities for the monitoring of the implementation of approximation of legislation and law enforcement actions to be taken.Article 73Competition and other economic provisions1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the Community and Montenegro:(i) all Agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;(ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community or Montenegro as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;(iii) any State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain products.2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition rules applicable in the Community, in particular from Articles 81, 82, 86 and 87 of the EC Treaty and interpretative instruments adopted by the Community institutions.3. The Parties shall ensure that an operationally independent authority is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(i) and (ii) of this Article, regarding private and public undertakings and undertakings to which special rights have been granted.4. Montenegro shall establish an operationally independent authority which is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(iii) within one year from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. This authority shall have, inter alia, the powers to authorise State aid schemes and individual aid grants in conformity with paragraph 2, as well as the powers to order the recovery of State aid that has been unlawfully granted.5. The Community on one side and Montenegro on the other side shall ensure transparency in the area of State aid, inter alia by providing to the other Parties a regular annual report, or equivalent, following the methodology and the presentation of the Community survey on State aid. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid.6. Montenegro shall establish a comprehensive inventory of aid schemes instituted before the establishment of the authority referred to in paragraph 4 and shall align such aid schemes with the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 within a period of no more than 4 years from the entry into force of this Agreement.7. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii), the Parties recognise that during the first five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by Montenegro shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Montenegro shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 87(3) (a) of the EC Treaty.(b) Within four years from the entry into force of this Agreement, Montenegro shall submit to the European Commission its GDP per capita figures harmonised at NUTS II level. The authority referred to in paragraph 4 and the European Commission shall then jointly evaluate the eligibility of the regions of Montenegro as well as the maximum aid intensities in relation thereto in order to draw up the regional aid map on the basis of the relevant Community guidelines.8. As appropriate, Protocol 5 establishes the rules on state aid in the steel industry. This Protocol establishes the rules applicable in the event restructuring aid is granted to the steel industry. It would stress the exceptional character of such aid and the fact that the aid would be limited in time and would be linked to capacity reductions within the framework of feasibility programmes.9. With regard to products referred to in Chapter II of Title IV:(a) paragraph 1(iii) shall not apply;(b) any practices contrary to paragraph 1(i) shall be assessed according to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of Articles 36 and 37 of the EC Treaty and specific Community instruments adopted on this basis.10. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Stabilisation and Association Council or after 30 working days following referral for such consultation. Nothing in this Article shall prejudice or affect in any way the taking, by the Community or Montenegro, of countervailing measures in accordance with the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the respective related internal legislation.Article 74Public undertakingsBy the end of the third year following the entry into force of this Agreement, Montenegro shall apply to public undertakings and undertakings to which special and exclusive rights have been granted the principles set out in the EC Treaty, with particular reference to Article 86.Special rights of public undertakings during the transitional period shall not include the possibility to impose quantitative restrictions or measures having an equivalent effect on imports from the Community into Montenegro.Article 75Intellectual, industrial and commercial property1. Pursuant to the provisions of this Article and Annex VII, the Parties confirm the importance that they attach to ensuring adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights.2. From the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall grant to each others companies and nationals, in respect of the recognition and protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property, treatment no less favourable than that granted by them to any third country under bilateral Agreements.3. Montenegro shall take the necessary measures in order to guarantee no later than five years after entry into force of this Agreement a level of protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights similar to that existing in the Community, including effective means of enforcing such rights.4. Montenegro undertakes to accede, within the period referred to above, to the multilateral conventions on intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights referred to in Annex VII. The Stabilisation and Association Council may decide to oblige Montenegro to accede to specific multilateral Conventions in this area.5. If problems in the area of intellectual, industrial and commercial property affecting trading conditions occur, they shall be referred urgently to the Stabilisation and Association Council, at the request of either Party, with a view to reaching mutually satisfactory solutions.Article 76Public procurement1. The Community and Montenegro consider the opening-up of the award of public contracts on the basis of non-discrimination and reciprocity, following in particular the WTO rules, to be a desirable objective.2. Montenegrin companies, whether established or not in the Community, shall be granted access to contract award procedures in the Community pursuant to Community procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Community companies as from the entry into force of this Agreement.The above provisions shall also apply to contracts in the utilities sector once the government of Montenegro has adopted the legislation introducing the Community rules in this area. The Community shall examine periodically whether Montenegro has indeed introduced such legislation.3. Community companies established in Montenegro under the provisions of Chapter II of Title V shall, from the entry into force of this Agreement, be granted access to contract award procedures in Montenegro under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Montenegrin companies.4. Community companies not established in Montenegro shall be granted access to contract award procedures in Montenegro under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Montenegrin companies as from the entry into force of this Agreement.5.

For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the Community:(a) products wholly obtained in the Community within the meaning of Article 5;(b) products obtained in the Community incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Community within the meaning of Article 6.2. For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in Montenegro:(a) products wholly obtained in Montenegro within the meaning of Article 5;(b) products obtained in Montenegro incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in Montenegro within the meaning of Article 6.Article 3Cumulation in the Community1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in the Community if such products are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in Montenegro, in the Community or in any country or territory participating in the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process [1], or incorporating the materials originating in Turkey to which the Decision n° 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 [2] applies, provided that the working or processing carried out in the Community goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.2. Where the working or processing carried out in the Community does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the Community only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the Community.3. Products, originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1, which do not undergo any working or processing in the Community, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.4. The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:(a) a preferential trade Agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) is applicable between the countries or territories involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination;(b) materials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol;and(c) notices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in Montenegro according to its own procedures.The cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).The Community shall provide Montenegro, through the European Commission with details of the Agreements and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1.The products in Annex V shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in this Article.Article 4Cumulation in Montenegro1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2), products shall be considered as originating in Montenegro if such products are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in the Community, Montenegro, or in any country or territory participating in the European Union's Stabilisation and Association Process [1] or incorporating the materials originating in Turkey to which the Decision n° 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 [2] applies, provided that the working or processing carried out in Montenegro goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.2. Where the working or processing carried out in Montenegro does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in Montenegro only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in Montenegro.3. Products, originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1, which do not undergo any working or processing in Montenegro, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.4. The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:(a) a preferential trade Agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) is applicable between the countries or territories involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination;(b) materials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol;and(c) notices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in Montenegro according to its own procedures.The cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).Montenegro shall provide the Community, through the European Commission with details of the Agreements, including their dates of entry into force, and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1.The products in Annex V shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in this Article.Article 5Wholly obtained products1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the Community or in Montenegro:(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;(b) vegetable products harvested there;(c) live animals born and raised there;(d) products from live animals raised there;(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;(f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the Community or of Montenegro by their vessels;(g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f);(h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;(i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;(j) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;(k) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in (a) to (j).2.

For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:(a) their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;(b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 7.Article 7Insufficient working or processing1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 6 are satisfied:(a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;(b) breaking-up and assembly of packages;(c) washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;(d) ironing or pressing of textiles;(e) simple painting and polishing operations;(f) husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;(g) operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps;(h) peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;(i) sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;(j) sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);(k) simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;(l) affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;(m) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any other material;(n) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;(o) a combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (n);(p) slaughter of animals.2. All operations carried out either in the Community or in Montenegro on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.Article 8Unit of qualification1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.It follows that:(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonized System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.Article 9Accessories, spare parts and toolsAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.Article 10SetsSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.Article 11Neutral elementsIn order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:(a) energy and fuel;(b) plant and equipment;(c) machines and tools;(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.TITLE IIITERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTSArticle 12Principle of territoriality1. Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 4 and paragraph 3 of this Article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or in Montenegro.2. Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 4, where originating goods exported from the Community or from Montenegro to another country return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(a) the returning goods are the same as those exported;and(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.3. The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the Community or Montenegro on materials exported from the Community or from Montenegro and subsequently re-imported there, provided:(a) the said materials are wholly obtained in the Community or in Montenegro or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 7 prior to being exported;and(b) it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(i) the re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials;and(ii) the total added value acquired outside the Community or Montenegro by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed.4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the Community or Montenegro. But where, in the list in Annex II, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the Community or Montenegro by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.5. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, \"total added value\" shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside the Community or Montenegro, including the value of the materials incorporated there.6. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 6(2) is applied.7.

Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:(a) a single transport document covering the passage from the exporting country through the country of transit; or(b) a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:(i) giving an exact description of the products;(ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used;and(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.Article 14Exhibitions1. Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country or territory other than those referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and sold after the exhibition for importation in the Community or in Montenegro shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(a) an exporter has consigned these products from the Community or from Montenegro to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Community or in Montenegro;(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition;and(d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.2.

Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the Community, in Montenegro or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in the Community or in Montenegro to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the Community or in Montenegro to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there.3. The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 8(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 9 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 10 when such items are non-originating.5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which this Agreement applies. Furthermore, they shall not preclude the application of an export refund system for agricultural products, applicable upon export in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.TITLE VPROOF OF ORIGINArticle 16General requirements1. Products originating in the Community shall, on importation into Montenegro and products originating in Montenegro shall, on importation into the Community benefit from this Agreement upon submission of either:(a) a movement certificate EUR.1, a specimen of which appears in Annex III; or(b) in the cases specified in Article 22(1), a declaration, subsequently referred to as the \"invoice declaration\", given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified; the text of the invoice declaration appears in Annex IV.2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, in the cases specified in Article 27, benefit from this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to above.Article 17Procedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.11. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.2. For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex III. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which this Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.4. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Member State of the Community or of Montenegro if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, Montenegro or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.5. The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.Article 18Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively1. Notwithstanding Article 17(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:(a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances;or(b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file.4. Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with the following phrase in English:\"ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY\".5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the \"Remarks\" box of the movement certificate EUR.1.Article 19Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.11. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with the following word in English:\"DUPLICATE\".3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the \"Remarks\" box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.Article 20Issue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previouslyWhen originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the Community or in Montenegro, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the Community or Montenegro. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.Article 21Accounting segregation1. Where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called \"accounting segregation\" method to be used for managing such stocks.2. This method must be able to ensure that, for a specific reference-period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as \"originating\" is the same as that which would have been obtained if there had been physical segregation of the stocks.3. The customs authorities may grant such authorisation, subject to any conditions deemed appropriate.4. This method is recorded and applied on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured.5. The beneficiary of this facilitation may issue or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.6. The customs authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation and may withdraw it at any time whenever the beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.Article 22Conditions for making out an invoice declaration1. An invoice declaration as referred to in Article 16(1)(b) may be made out:(a) by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23,or(b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed EUR 6000.2. An invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Montenegro or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.3. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.4. An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.5. Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.6. An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.Article 23Approved exporter1. The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter, hereinafter referred to as \"approved exporter\", who makes frequent shipments of products under this Agreement to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.2. The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.3. The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the invoice declaration.4. The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.5. The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.Article 24Validity of proof of origin1. A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.Article 25Submission of proof of originProofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this Agreement.Article 26Importation by instalmentsWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonized System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.Article 27Exemptions from proof of origin1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers’ personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1200 in the case of products forming part of travellers’ personal luggage.Article 28Supporting documentsThe documents referred to in Articles 17(3) and 22(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Montenegro or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist inter alia of the following:(a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal book-keeping;(b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or in Montenegro where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;(c) documents proving the working or processing of materials in the Community or in Montenegro, issued or made out in the Community or in Montenegro, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;(d) movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or in Montenegro in accordance with this Protocol, or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4, in accordance with rules of origin which are identical to the rules in this Protocol;(e) appropriate evidence concerning working or processing undergone outside the Community or Montenegro by application of Article 12, proving that the requirements of that Article have been satisfied.Article 29Preservation of proof of origin and supporting documents1.

The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them.Article 30Discrepancies and formal errors1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.Article 31Amounts expressed in euro1. For the application of the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Community, of Montenegro and of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) or Article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.4. A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Stabilisation and Association Committee at the request of the Community or of Montenegro. When carrying out this review, the Stabilisation and Association Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.TITLE VIARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATIONArticle 32Mutual assistance1. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Community and of Montenegro shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations.2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Community and Montenegro shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 or the invoice declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.Article 33Verification of proofs of origin1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Montenegro or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.Article 34Dispute settlementWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 33 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Stabilisation and Association Committee.In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.Article 35PenaltiesPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.Article 36Free zones1. The Community and Montenegro shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or in Montenegro are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.TITLE VIICEUTA AND MELILLAArticle 37Application of this Protocol1. The term \"Community\" used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta or Melilla.2. Products originating in Montenegro, when imported into Ceuta and Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities. Montenegro shall grant to imports of products covered by this Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community.3. For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 38.Article 38Special conditions1. Providing they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, the following shall be considered as:1) products originating in Ceuta and Melilla:(a) products wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;(b) products obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 6;or that(ii) those products are originating in Montenegro or in the Community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7;2) products originating in Montenegro:(a) products wholly obtained in Montenegro;(b) products obtained in Montenegro, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 6;or that(ii) those products are originating in Ceuta and Melilla or in the Community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7.2. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.3. The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter \"Montenegro\" and \"Ceuta and Melilla\" in Box 2 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations. In addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in Box 4 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations.4. The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.TITLE VIIIFINAL PROVISIONSArticle 39Amendments to this ProtocolThe Stabilisation and Association Council may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.[1] As defined in the Conclusions of the General Affairs Council in April 1997 and Commission Communication of May 1999 on the establishment of the Stabilisation and Association process with Western Balkan countries.[2] Decision n° 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 applies to products other than agricultural products as defined in the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey and other than coal and steel products as defined in the Agreement between the European Coal and Steel Community and the Republic of Turkey on trade in products covered by the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX IINTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX IINote 1The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 6.Note 22.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.Note 33.1. The provisions of Article 6, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a contracting party.Example:An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex7224.If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.Example:The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).Example:The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.Example:In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth – even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is, the fibre stage.3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.Note 44.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.Note 55.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.The following are the basic textile materials:- silk,- wool,- coarse animal hair,- fine animal hair,- horsehair,- cotton,- paper-making materials and paper,- flax,- true hemp,- jute and other textile bast fibres,- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,- synthetic man-made filaments,- artificial man-made filaments,- current-conducting filaments,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),- other synthetic man-made staple fibres,- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,- other artificial man-made staple fibres,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,- products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,- other products of heading 5605.Example:A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.Example:A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.Example:Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.Example:If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.Note 66.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.Example:If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.6.3. Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.Note 77.1. For the purposes of headings ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum-distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(i) isomerisation.7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum-distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(ij) isomerisation;(k) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);(l) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;(m) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;(n) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;(o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;(p) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.7.3. For the purposes of headings ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX IILIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUSThe products mentioned in the list may not be all covered by this Agreement.

Cooperation shall cover land transport, and in particular road, rail and combined transport, and shall include the relevant infrastructure.2. In this connection, the scope of this Protocol shall cover in particular:- transport infrastructure in the territory of one or other Party to the extent necessary to achieve the objective of this Protocol;- market access, on a reciprocal basis, in the field of road transport;- essential legal and administrative supporting measures including commercial, taxation, social and technical measures;- cooperation in developing a transport system which meets environmental needs;- a regular exchange of information on the development of the transport policies of the Parties, with particular regard to transport infrastructure.Article 3DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Protocol, the following definitions shall apply:(a) Community transit traffic: the carriage, by a carrier established in the Community, of goods in transit through the territory of Montenegro \"en route\" to or from a Member State of the Community;(b) Montenegrin transit traffic: the carriage, by a carrier established in Montenegro, of goods in transit from Montenegro through Community territory and destined for a third country or of goods from a third country destined for Montenegro;(c) combined transport: the transport of goods where the lorry, trailer, semi-trailer, with or without tractor unit, swap body or container of 20 feet or more, uses the road on the initial or final leg of the journey and on the other leg, rail or inland waterway or maritime services where this section exceeds 100 kilometres as the crow flies and make the initial or final road transport leg of the journey;- between the point where the goods are loaded and the nearest suitable rail loading station for the initial leg, and between the nearest suitable rail unloading station and the point where the goods are unloaded for the final leg, o- within a radius not exceeding 150 km as the crow flies from the inland waterway port or seaport of loading or unloading.INFRASTRUCTUREArticle 4General ProvisionThe Contracting Parties hereby agree to adopt mutually coordinated measures to develop a multimodal transport infrastructure network as a vital means of solving the problems affecting the carriage of goods through Montenegro in particular on the road routes 1, 2b, 4, and 6 connecting the border with Croatia to Bar, the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina to the border with Albania, the border with Serbia to Misici and Ribaravina to Bac at the border with Serbia respectively; the rail routes 2 and 4 connecting Podgorica to the border with Albania and the border with Serbia to Bar; the port of Bar and the Podgorica airport, which form part of the Core Regional Transport Network as defined in the MoU referred to in Article 5.Article 5PlanningThe development of a multimodal regional transport network on the territory of Montenegro which serves the needs of Montenegro and the South-Eastern European region covering the main road and rail routes, inland waterways, inland ports, ports, airports and other relevant modes of the network is of particular interest to the Community and Montenegro. This network was defined in the Memorandum of Understanding for developing a Core Transport Infrastructure Network for South East Europe which was signed by ministers from the region, and the European Commission, in June 2004. The development of the network and the selection of priorities is being carried out by a Steering Committee comprised of representatives of each of the signatories.Article 6Financial aspects1. The Community may contribute financially, under Article 116 of this Agreement, to the necessary infrastructure work referred to in Article 5. This financial contribution may take the form of credit from the European Investment Bank and any other form of financing which can provide further additional resources.2. In order to speed up the work the European Commission will endeavour, as far as possible, to encourage the use of additional resources such as investment by certain Member States on a bilateral basis or from public or private funds.RAIL AND COMBINED TRANSPORTArticle 7General provisionThe Parties shall adopt the mutually coordinated measures necessary for the development and promotion of rail and combined transport as a mean of ensuring that in the future a major proportion of their bilateral and transit transport through Montenegro is performed under more environmentally-friendly conditions.Article 8Particular aspects relating to infrastructureAs part of the modernisation of the railways of Montenegro, the necessary steps shall be taken to adapt the system for combined transport, with particular regard to the development or building of terminals, tunnel gauges and capacity, which require substantial investment.Article 9Supporting measuresThe Parties shall take all the steps necessary to encourage the development of combined transport.The purpose of such measures shall be:- to encourage the use of combined transport by users and consignors;- to make combined transport competitive with road transport, in particular through the financial support of the Community, Montenegro in the context of their respective legislation;- to encourage the use of combined transport over long distances and to promote, in particular the use of swap bodies, containers and unaccompanied transport in general;- to improve the speed and reliability of combined transport and in particular:- to increase the frequency of convoys in accordance with the needs of consignors and users;- to reduce the waiting time at terminals and increase their productivity;- to remove in an appropriate manner, all obstacles from the approach routes so as to improve access to combined transport;- to harmonise, where necessary, the weights, dimensions and technical characteristics of specialised equipment, in particular so as to ensure the necessary compatibility of gauges, and to take coordinated action to order and to put into service such equipment as is required by the level of traffic;- and, in general, to take any other appropriate action.Article 10The role of the railwaysIn connection with the respective powers of the States and the railways, the Parties shall, in respect of both passenger and goods transport, recommend that their railways:- step up cooperation, whether bilateral, multilateral or within international railway organisations, in all fields, with particular regard to the improvement of the quality and the safety of transport services;- try to establish in common a system of organising the railways so as to encourage consignors to send freight by rail rather than road, in particular for transit purposes, on a basis of fair competition and while leaving the user freedom of choice in this matter;- prepare the participation of Montenegro in the implementation and future evolution of the Community acquis on the development of the railways.ROAD TRANSPORTArticle 11General Provisions1. With regard to mutual access to transport markets, the Parties agree, initially and without prejudice to paragraph 2, to maintain the regime resulting from bilateral Agreements or other existing international bilateral instruments concluded between each Member State of the Community and Montenegro or, where there are no such Agreements or instruments, arising from the de facto situation in 1991.However, whilst awaiting the conclusion of Agreements between the Community and Montenegro on access to the road transport market, as provided for in Article 12, and on road taxation, as provided for in Article 13(2), Montenegro shall cooperate with the Member States of the Community to amend these bilateral Agreements to adapt them to this Protocol.2. The Parties hereby agree to grant unrestricted access to Community transit traffic through Montenegro and to Montenegrin transit traffic through the Community with effect from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.3. If, as a result of the rights granted under paragraph 2, transit traffic by Community hauliers increases to such a degree as to cause or threaten to cause serious harm to road infrastructure and/or traffic fluidity on the axes mentioned in Article 5, and under the same circumstances problems arise on Community territory close to the borders of Montenegro, the matter shall be submitted to the Stabilisation and Association Council in accordance with Article 121 of this Agreement. The Parties may propose exceptional temporary, non-discriminatory measures as are necessary to limit or mitigate such harm.4. If the Community establishes rules aiming to reduce pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles registered in the European Union and to improve traffic safety, a similar regime shall apply to heavy goods vehicles registered in Montenegro that wish to circulate through the Community territory. The Stabilisation and Association Council shall decide on the necessary modalities.5. The Parties shall refrain from taking any unilateral action that might lead to discrimination between Community carriers or vehicles and carriers or vehicles from Montenegro. Each Contracting Party shall take all steps necessary to facilitate road transport to or through the territory of the other Contracting Party.Article 12Access to the marketThe Parties shall, as a matter of priority, undertake to work together to seek, each of them subject to their internal rules:- courses of action likely to favour the development of a transport system which meets the needs of the Contracting Parties, and which is compatible, on the one hand, with the completion of the internal Community market and the implementation of the common transport policy and, on the other hand, with economic and transport policies of Montenegro;- a definitive system for regulating future road transport market access between Contracting Parties on the basis of reciprocity.Article 13Taxation, tolls and other charges1. The Parties accept that the taxation of road vehicles, tolls and other charges on either side must be non-discriminatory.2. The Parties shall enter into negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement on road taxation, as soon as possible, on the basis of the rules adopted by the Community on this matter. The purpose of this Agreement shall be, in particular, to ensure the free flow of trans-frontier traffic, to progressively eliminate differences between the road taxation systems applied by the Parties and to eliminate distortions of competition arising from such differences.3. Pending the conclusion of the negotiations mentioned in paragraph 2, the Parties will eliminate discrimination between hauliers of the Community and Montenegro when levying taxes and charges on the circulation and/or possession of heavy goods vehicles as well as taxes or charges levied on transport operations in the territory of the Parties. Montenegro undertakes to notify the European Commission, if so requested, the amount of taxes, tolls and charges which they apply, as well as the methods of calculating them.4. Until the conclusion of the Agreement mentioned in paragraph 2 and in Article 12 any change proposed after the entry into force of this Agreement to fiscal charges, tolls or other charges, including the systems for their collection which may be applied to Community traffic in transit through Montenegro will be subject to a prior consultation procedure.Article 14Weights and dimensions1. Montenegro accepts that road vehicles complying with Community standards on weights and dimensions may circulate freely and without hindrance in this respect on the routes covered by Article 5. During six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, road vehicles which do not comply with existing standards of Montenegro may be subject to a special non-discriminatory charge which reflects the damage caused by additional axle weight.2. Montenegro will endeavour to harmonise their existing regulations and standards for road construction with the legislation prevailing in the Community by the end of the fifth year after the entry into force of this Agreement and will make major efforts for improvement of the existing routes covered by Article 5 to those new regulations and standards within the proposed time, in accordance with their financial possibilities.Article 15Environment1. In order to protect the environment, the Parties shall endeavour to introduce standards on gaseous and particulate emissions and noise levels for heavy goods vehicles, which ensure a high level of protection.2. In order to provide the industry with clear information and to encourage coordinated research, programming and production, exceptional national standards in this field shall be avoided.Vehicles which comply with standards laid down by international Agreements also relating to environment may operate without further restrictions in the territory of the Parties.3. For the purpose of introducing new standards, the Parties shall work together to achieve the abovementioned objectives.Article 16Social aspects1. Montenegro shall harmonise their legislations on the training of road haulage personnel, particularly with respect to the carriage of dangerous goods, to the EC standards.2. Montenegro as a contracting party to the European Agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport (ERTA), and the Community will coordinate to the maximum extent possible their policies concerning driving time, interruptions and rest periods for drivers and crew composition, in respect of the future development of the social legislation in this area.3. The Parties shall cooperate with regard to implementation and enforcement of the social legislation in the field of road transport.4. The Parties shall ensure the equivalence of their respective laws on the admission to the occupation of road haulage operator, with a view to their mutual recognition.Article 17Provisions relating to traffic1. The Parties shall pool their experience and endeavour to harmonise their legislation so as to improve the flow of traffic during peak periods (weekends, public holidays, the tourist season).2. In general, the Parties shall encourage the introduction, development and coordination of a road traffic information system.3. They shall endeavour to harmonise their legislation on the carriage of perishable goods, live animals and dangerous substances.4. The Parties shall also endeavour to harmonise the technical assistance to be provided to drivers, the dissemination of essential information on traffic and other matters of concern to tourists, and emergency services including ambulance services.Article 18Road Safety1. Montenegro shall harmonise their legislation on road safety, particularly with regard to the transport of dangerous goods, to that of the Community by the end of the second year after the entry into force of this Agreement.2. Montenegro as a contracting Party of the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) and the Community will coordinate to the maximum extent possible their policies concerning the carriage of dangerous goods.3. The Parties shall cooperate with regard to implementation and enforcement of road safety legislation, particularly on driving licences and measures to reduce road accidents.SIMPLIFICATION OF FORMALITIESArticle 19Simplification of formalities1. The Parties agree to simplify the flow of goods by rail and road, whether bilateral or in transit.2. The Parties agree to begin negotiations with a view to concluding an Agreement on the facilitation of controls and formalities relating to the carriage of goods.3.

The Parties recognise the need that Montenegro addresses promptly any structural weaknesses of its steel sector to ensure the global competitiveness of its industry.2. Further to the disciplines stipulated by paragraph 1(iii) of Article 73 of this Agreement, the assessment of the compatibility of State aid to the steel industry as defined in Annex I of the Guidelines on national regional aid for 2007-2013 shall be made on the basis of the criteria arising from the application of Article 87 of the EC Treaty to the steel sector, including secondary legislation.3. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii) of Article 73 of this Agreement with regard to the steel industry, the Community recognises that, during five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, Montenegro may exceptionally grant State aid for restructuring purposes to steel producing firms in difficulties, provided that(a) it leads to the long-term viability of the benefiting firms under normal market conditions at the end of the restructuring period, and(b) the amount and intensity of such aid are strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore such viability, and aid is where appropriate progressively reduced;(c) Montenegro presents restructuring programmes that are linked to a global rationalisation which includes the closing of inefficient capacity. Every steel producing firm benefiting from restructuring aid shall, as far as possible, provide for compensatory measures balancing the distortion of competition caused by the aid.4. Montenegro shall submit to the European Commission for assessment a National Restructuring Programme and individual business plans for each of the companies benefiting from restructuring aid which demonstrate that the above conditions are fulfilled.The individual business plans shall have been assessed and agreed by the State aid monitoring authority of Montenegro in view of their compliance with paragraph 3 of this Protocol.The European Commission shall confirm that the National Restructuring Programme is in compliance with the requirements of paragraph 3.5. The European Commission shall monitor the implementation of the plans, in close cooperation with the competent national authorities, in particular the State aid monitoring authority of Montenegro.If the monitoring indicates that aid to the beneficiaries which is not approved in the National Restructuring Programme or any restructuring aid to steel firms not identified in the National Restructuring Programme has been granted from the date of signature of this Agreement onwards, the State aid monitoring authority of Montenegro shall ensure that any such aid is reimbursed.6. Upon request, the Community shall provide Montenegro with technical support for the preparation of the National Restructuring Programme and the individual business plans.7. Each Party shall ensure full transparency with respect to State aid. In particular, as regards State aid granted to steel production in Montenegro and the implementation of the restructuring programme and the business plans, a full and continuous exchange of information shall take place.8. The Stabilisation and Association Council shall monitor the implementation of the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 above. To this effect, the Stabilisation and Association Council may draft implementing rules.9. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice of the other Party is incompatible with the terms of this Protocol, and if that practice causes or threatens to cause prejudice to the interests of the first Party or material injury to its domestic industry, this Party may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Sub-Committee dealing with competition matters or after thirty working days following referral for such consultation.--------------------------------------------------PROTOCOL 6protocol on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters MontenegroArticle 1DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Protocol:(a) \"customs legislation\" shall mean any legal or regulatory provisions applicable in the territories of the Contracting Parties, governing the import, export and transit of goods and their placing under any other customs regime or procedure, including measures of prohibition, restriction and control;(b) \"applicant authority\" shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been designated by a Contracting Party for this purpose and which makes a request for assistance on the basis of this Protocol;(c) \"requested authority\" shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been designated by a Contracting Party for this purpose and which receives a request for assistance on the basis of this Protocol;(d) \"personal data\" shall mean all information relating to an identified or identifiable individual;(e) \"operation in breach of customs legislation\" shall mean any violation or attempted violation of customs legislation.Article 2Scope1.

Under no circumstances should the ruling be issued later than 120 days from the date of the establishment of the panel.2. In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to issue its ruling within 45 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. Under no circumstance should it take longer than 100 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. The arbitration panel may give a preliminary ruling within 10 days of its establishment on whether it deems the case to be urgent.3.

The complaining Party may withdraw its complaint by written notification to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, the Party complained against and the Stabilisation and Association Committee, at any time before the ruling is notified to the Parties and the Stabilisation and Association Committee. Such withdrawal is without prejudice to the complaining Party's right to introduce a new complaint regarding the same measure at a later point in time.5. The arbitration panel shall, at the request of both Parties, suspend its work at any time for a period not exceeding 12 months. Once the period of 12 months has been exceeded, the authority for the establishment of the panel will lapse, without prejudice to the right of the complaining Party to request at a later stage the establishment of a panel on the same measure.Section IIComplianceArticle 6Compliance with the arbitration panel rulingEach Party shall take any measure necessary to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, and the Parties will endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time to comply with the ruling.Article 7Reasonable period of time for compliance1.

If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the arbitration panel rules that the measure notified under Article 8 paragraph 1 is not in conformity with that Party's obligations under this Agreement, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, present an offer for temporary compensation.2. If no agreement on compensation is reached within 30 days of the end of the reasonable period of time, or of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 8 that a measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, to suspend the application of benefits granted under the provisions referred to in Article 2 of this Protocol at a level equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation. The complaining Party may implement the suspension 10 days after the date of the notification, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph 3.3. If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation, it may request in writing to the chairperson of the original arbitration panel before the expiry of the 10 day period referred to in paragraph 2 for the reconvening of the original arbitration panel. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of benefits to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee within 30 days of the date of the submission of the request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration panel has issued its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the ruling of the arbitration panel.4. The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall be applied only until any measure found to violate this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with this Agreement, or until the Parties have agreed to settle the dispute.Article 10Review of any measure taken to comply after the suspension of benefits1. The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee of any measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its request for an end to the suspension of benefits applied by the complaining Party.2. If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with this Agreement within 30 days of the date of the submission of the notification, the complaining Party may request in writing to the chairperson of the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the arbitration panel will determine whether the complaining party can continue the suspension of benefits at the original or at a different level. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity with this Agreement, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated.3. In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article 4 shall apply. The period for notifying the ruling remains 45 days from the date of the panel’s establishment.Section IIICommon provisionsArticle 11Open HearingsThe meetings of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public under the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure referred to in Article 18, unless the arbitration panel decides otherwise on its own motion or at the request of the Parties.Article 12Information and technical adviceAt the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the panel may seek information from any source it deems appropriate for the panel proceeding.
