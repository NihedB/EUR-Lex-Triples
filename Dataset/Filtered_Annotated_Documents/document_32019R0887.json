{"celex_id": "32019R0887", "reference": "29.5.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 142/16\nCOMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/887\nof 13 March 2019\non the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies referred to in Article 71 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regards to Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union amending Regulations (EU) No 1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No 1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (1), and in particular the third paragraph of Article 71 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nBy Delegated Regulation (EU) No 110/2014 (2), the Commission adopted a the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies referred to in Article 209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).\n(2)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. It is therefore necessary to adopt a model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies referred to in Article 71 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 (hereafter ‘PPP bodies’).\n(3)\nIn order to adopt rules ensuring sound financial management of Union funds and to enable PPP bodies to adopt their own financial rules, it is necessary to adopt a model financial regulation for those bodies. The PPP bodies' financial rules may not depart from this Regulation except where their specific needs so require, and with the Commission's prior consent.\n(4)\nThe model financial regulation for PPP bodies should be consistent with the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 and should allow for additional simplification and clarification to take into account the experience gained in their application.\n(5)\nFollowing the adoption of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/1929 (4) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/2461 (5) amended Delegated Regulation (EU) No 110/2014 on the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies to align the rules on discharge, reporting and external audit on those applicable to the bodies referred to in Article 70 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. Rules on governance, internal audit and accountability applicable to PPP bodies should be made consistent with the corresponding provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/715 (6) applicable to the bodies referred to in Article 70 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046.\n(6)\nGiven that Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (7) has been repealed, the obligation for the PPP bodies to adopt their own implementing rules should also be removed.\n(7)\nPPP bodies should establish and implement their budget in accordance with the budgetary principles of unity, budgetary accuracy, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, specification and sound financial management, which requires transparency and effective and efficient internal control.\n(8)\nTo ensure continuity of operation and in order to allow for the commitment of routine administrative expenditure at the end of a financial year, PPP bodies should be able under specific conditions to commit such expenditure in advance against the appropriations provided for the following financial.\n(9)\nTaking into account their specificities, PPP bodies should not be able to use corporate sponsoring.\n(10)\nThe concept of performance as regards the budget should be clarified. Performance should be linked to the principle of sound financial management. The principle of sound financial management should be defined. A link should be established between, on the one hand, the objectives set and performance indicators and, on the other hand, the results and the economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of appropriations.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure the overall implementation of the tasks and activities of a PPP body, it should be able to enter the unused appropriations for a given year in the estimate of revenue and expenditure of the following three financial years.\n(12)\nIt is necessary to specify the powers and responsibilities of the accounting officer and of the authorising officer, taking into account the public-private nature of PPP bodies. The authorising officers should be fully responsible for all revenue and expenditure operations executed under their authority and should be held accountable for their actions, including, where necessary, through disciplinary proceedings. In order to prevent errors and irregularities, authorising officers should set up a multiannual control strategy which should be based on risk-based and cost-effectiveness considerations.\n(13)\nIn order to guarantee that each PPP body is accountable for the implementation of its budget and adheres to the objectives assigned to it at its establishment, PPP bodies should be allowed, where necessary, to employ external private sector bodies for the performance of the tasks entrusted to them, where necessary, unless those tasks involve a public service mission or any use of discretionary powers of judgement.\n(14)\nIn order to facilitate the implementation of their appropriations and in compliance with the principle of sound financial management, PPP bodies should have the possibility to conclude service-level agreements in accordance with Article 59(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, in particular with the Union institutions and other Union bodies. Appropriate reporting on those service-level agreements should be ensured.\n(15)\nIn order to improve cost-efficiency, PPP bodies should have the possibility of sharing services or transferring them to another body or the Commission, in particular by allowing the accounting officer of the Commission to be entrusted with all or part of the tasks of the accounting officer of a PPP body.\n(16)\nTo identify and correctly manage risk of actual or perceived conflict of interests, PPP bodies should be required to adopt rules on the prevention and management of conflict of interests. Such rules should take into account guidance provided by the Commission.\n(17)\nThe principles to be followed as to the revenue and expenditure operations of each PPP body should be laid down.\n(18)\nIn line with the specific nature of the PPP bodies, their members should bear the costs of their contribution to the administrative costs of the PPP body. Non-member beneficiaries of funding provided by a PPP body should not contribute to such costs directly or indirectly and in any form, and they should not be invited or requested to contribute to the administrative costs of the PPP body when participating to projects co-financed by that body.\n(19)\nPPP bodies shall adopt its annual work programme for a particular year by the end of the previous year. This annual work programme should contain a description of the activities to be financed and an indication of the amounts allocated to each of them, information on the overall strategy for the implementation of the programme entrusted to the PPP body, as well as the strategy for achieving efficiency gains and synergies. The annual work programme should also contain a strategy for organisational management and internal control systems, including an anti-fraud strategy and an indication of measures to prevent recurrence of cases of conflict of interests, irregularities and fraud, in particular where weaknesses have led to critical recommendations\n(20)\nIn addition to the forms of Union contribution already well established (reimbursement of the eligible costs actually incurred, unit cost, lump sums and flat-rate financing), it is appropriate to allow PPP bodies to provide support through financing not linked to the costs of the relevant operations. This additional form of financing should be based on the fulfilment of certain conditions ex ante or on the achievement of results measured by reference to previously set milestones or through performance indicators.\n(21)\nIn order to protect the financial interests of the Union, the rules on a single early-detection and exclusion system set up by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 should apply to PPP bodies.\n(22)\nIn order to strengthen the governance of PPP bodies, they should report cases of fraud, financial irregularities and investigations to the Commission without delay.\n(23)\nGiven the public-private nature of PPP bodies and in particular the private sector contribution to the budget of a PPP body, flexible procedures for the award of procurement contracts should be provided for. These procedures should respect the principles of transparency, proportionality, equality of treatment and non-discrimination and can depart from the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. Reinforced cooperation among the members of PPP bodies is expected to contribute to better and cheaper supply of goods and services, as well as the avoidance of excessive costs in managing procurement procedures. For the supply of products, provision of services or performance of work that those members provide directly and without having recourse to third parties, PPP bodies should therefore have the possibility to conclude contracts without having recourse to a procurement procedure with their members other than the Union.\n(24)\nPPP bodies should be able to use external experts for the evaluation of grant applications, projects and tenders and for providing opinions and advice in specific cases. These experts should be selected in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment and absence of conflict of interests.\n(25)\nAs regards the award of grants and prizes, in order to ensure a coherent implementation with the actions directly managed by the Commission, the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 should apply, subject to specific provisions of the constituent act of the PPP body or of the basic act of the programme the implementation of which is entrusted to the PPP body.\n(26)\nPursuant to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), PPP bodies shall transmit to the European Anti-Fraud Office without delay any information relating to possible cases of fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. Pursuant to Article 24(1) of Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (9), PPP bodies shall without undue delay report to the European Public Prosecutor's Office any criminal conduct in respect of which it could exercise its competence in accordance with that regulation. In order to strengthen the governance of PPP bodies, they should also report cases of fraud, financial irregularities, as well as investigations, to the Commission without delay. The Commission and the PPP bodies should put procedures in place that duly protect personal data and ensure the respect of the need-to-know principle in any transmission of information related to presumed fraud and other irregularities and on-going or completed investigations.\n(27)\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 110/2014 should be repealed. The reference to the repealed regulation should be construed as references to this Regulation.\n(28)\nIn order to allow for the timely adoption of the revised financial regulations by the PPP bodies as of 1 September 2019 and so that the PPP bodies may benefit from the simplification and alignment with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER 1\nSCOPE\nArticle 1\nSubject Matter\nThis Regulation lays down the essential principles on the basis of which the public-private partnership bodies referred to in Article 71 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 (‘PPP bodies’) shall adopt their own financial rules.

The duties of authorising officer and accounting officer shall be segregated and mutually exclusive.\n2.   Each PP body shall provide each financial actor with the resources required to perform his or her duties and a charter describing in detail his or her tasks, rights and obligations.\nArticle 19\nBudget implementation in accordance with the principle of sound financial management\n1.   The director shall perform the duties of authorising officer. The director shall implement the revenue and expenditure of the budget of the PPP body in accordance with the financial rules of the PPP body and the principle of sound financial management, including through ensuring reporting on performance, under his or her own responsibility and within the limits of the appropriations authorised.

The authorising officer may put in place ex post controls to detect and correct errors and irregularities or operations after they have been authorised. Such controls may be organised on a sample basis according to risk and shall take account of the results of prior controls as well as cost-effectiveness and performance considerations.\nThe ex post controls may be carried out on the basis of documents and, where appropriate, on the spot.\n2.   The ex post controls shall be carried out by staff other than that responsible for the ex ante controls. The staff responsible for the ex post controls shall not be subordinate to the members of the staff responsible for the ex ante controls.\nAuthorising officers responsible and staff responsible for budget implementation shall have the necessary professional skills.\nArticle 23\nConsolidated Annual Activity report\n1.

regulation for public–private partnership bodies\nSUMMARY OF:\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2019/887 on the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies referred to in Article 71 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt lays down the essential principles and rules that public–private partnership bodies (PPP bodies)* covered by Article 71 of the financial regulation (see summary) must respect when adopting their own specific financial arrangements.\nThe purpose of the delegated regulation is to ensure sound financial management of European Union (EU) funds given to these bodies.\nEach PPP body adopts its own financial rules in line with the delegated regulation. PPP bodies may only depart from its rules, because of their specific needs, with the prior consent of the European Commission.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe PPP body’s annual budget must forecast and authorise all revenue and expenditure. This covers:\nmembers’ financial contributions to administrative and operational costs;\nrevenue earmarked for specific expenditure;\nrevenue the PPP body generates;\nexpenditure, including on administration.\nThe PPP body must respect the following budgetary principles.\nUnity and budgetary accuracy\nAll revenue and expenditure must be booked to a budget line.\nNo expenditure can be greater than the amount authorised in the budget.\nAnnuality\nThe budget’s financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December.\nCommitment appropriations* cover the total costs legally entered into during the financial year.\nPayment appropriations* cover expenditure to honour the legal commitments made in the current or preceding financial years.\nEquilibrium\nRevenue and payment appropriations must be in balance.\nThe PPP may not raise loans within its budget.\nUnit of account\nThe budget is drawn up and implemented in euro.\nThe accounting officer, for cash-flow purposes, may operate in other currencies.\nUniversality\nTotal revenue must cover total payments.\nRevenue that has been earmarked for a particular purpose, such as income from foundations, subsidies, gifts and bequests, must be used for that specific purpose.\nSpecification\nAppropriations are earmarked for specific purposes by title and chapter.\nThe director may transfer appropriations from one budget line and chapter to another, subject to certain conditions.\nSound financial management and performance\nPayments must respect the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.\nPayments focus on performance, based on objectives and indicators to measure progress made.\nInternal control of budget implementation\nApplies at all management levels.\nAims to achieve reasonable assurance of: effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations;reliability of reporting;safeguarding of assets and information;prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of fraud and irregularities;adequate management of risks of underlying transactions.\nTransparency\nThe PPP body must publish its budget, recipients of payments and other relevant information on its website, in an easily accessible, transparent and comprehensive way.\nAs regards conflicts of interest, the PPP body publishes the declaration of interest of the governing board members on its website every year.\nFinancial planning requires:\nthe PPP body to send the Commission and other members a detailed estimate of the following year’s revenue and expenditure and draft annual work programme no later than 31 January;\nthe PPP body’s governing board to adopt the PPP body’s budget and staff establishment plan.\nThe regulation makes the following statements.\nThe duties of the authorising officer and the accounting officer are segregated and mutually exclusive.\nThe director performs the authorising officer’s duties. These include: respecting the PPP body’s financial rules and the principle of sound financial management;applying checks before and possibly after payments are made;reporting annually to the governing board by submitting a consolidated annual activity report;acting, when necessary, to protect the EU’s financial interests.\nThe governing board appoints an accounting officer responsible for: properly implementing payments, collecting revenue and recovering amounts due;keeping, preparing and presenting the accounts;implementing the accounting rules and the chart of accounts;laying down and validating the accounting systems;managing the treasury.\nAuthorising and accounting officers, members of the governing board and others involved in implementing and managing the budget must avoid any conflicts of interest.\nPPP bodies must have an internal audit function. The Commission’s internal auditor carries out this role by:\nadvising on risks, the quality of management and control systems and possible improvements;\nenjoying complete independence in their work.\nRevenue and expenditure operations require:\nrevenue: drawing up estimates of amounts receivable, establishing entitlements to be recovered and recovering undue amounts;\nexpenditure: every item being committed, validated, authorised and paid.\nThe PPP body’s financial contributions must help achieve an EU policy objective with specific results. They can range from reimbursement of eligible costs to flat-rate financing.\nThe PPP body must inform the Commission of cases of presumed fraud or other financial irregularities without delay.\nAccounting rules require the PPP body to:\nset up an accounting system providing accurate, complete and reliable information in a timely manner;\nfollow standard procedures when providing supporting documents, financial statements, budget implementation reports, provisional and final accounts and an annual report on budgetary and financial management.\nAn independent external auditor verifies the PPP body’s annual accounts, and the European Parliament is responsible for approving how the budget was implemented (the ‘discharge procedure’).\nCommission staff and the Court of Auditors have access to the PPP body’s sites and premises to carry out audits, and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may conduct investigations, on-the-spot checks and inspections.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 30 May 2019, apart from the rules on the consolidated activity report (Article 23) and annual work programme (Article 33(4)) which have applied since 1 January 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFinancial regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union — publication (European Commission)\nGuidance on the avoidance and management of conflicts of interest under the financial regulation — notice (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPublic–private partnership bodies.
