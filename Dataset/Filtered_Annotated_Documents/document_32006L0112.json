{"celex_id": "32006L0112", "reference": "11.12.2006\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 347/1\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2006/112/EC\nof 28 November 2006\non the common system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 93 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (1) has been significantly amended on several occasions. Now that new amendments are being made to the said Directive, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalisation that the Directive should be recast.\n(2)\nThe recast text should incorporate all those provisions of Council Directive 67/227/EEC of 11 April 1967 on the harmonisation of legislation of Member States concerning turnover taxes (2) which are still applicable. That Directive should therefore be repealed.\n(3)\nTo ensure that the provisions are presented in a clear and rational manner, consistent with the principle of better regulation, it is appropriate to recast the structure and the wording of the Directive although this will not, in principle, bring about material changes in the existing legislation. A small number of substantive amendments are however inherent to the recasting exercise and should nevertheless be made. Where such changes are made, these are listed exhaustively in the provisions governing transposition and entry into force.\n(4)\nThe attainment of the objective of establishing an internal market presupposes the application in Member States of legislation on turnover taxes that does not distort conditions of competition or hinder the free movement of goods and services. It is therefore necessary to achieve such harmonisation of legislation on turnover taxes by means of a system of value added tax (VAT), such as will eliminate, as far as possible, factors which may distort conditions of competition, whether at national or Community level.\n(5)\nA VAT system achieves the highest degree of simplicity and of neutrality when the tax is levied in as general a manner as possible and when its scope covers all stages of production and distribution, as well as the supply of services. It is therefore in the interests of the internal market and of Member States to adopt a common system which also applies to the retail trade.\n(6)\nIt is necessary to proceed by stages, since the harmonisation of turnover taxes leads in Member States to alterations in tax structure and appreciable consequences in the budgetary, economic and social fields.\n(7)\nThe common system of VAT should, even if rates and exemptions are not fully harmonised, result in neutrality in competition, such that within the territory of each Member State similar goods and services bear the same tax burden, whatever the length of the production and distribution chain.\n(8)\nPursuant to Council Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom, of 29 September 2000 on the system of the European Communities' own resources (3), the budget of the European Communities is to be financed, without prejudice to other revenue, wholly from the Communities' own resources. Those resources are to include those accruing from VAT and obtained through the application of a uniform rate of tax to bases of assessment determined in a uniform manner and in accordance with Community rules.\n(9)\nIt is vital to provide for a transitional period to allow national laws in specified fields to be gradually adapted.\n(10)\nDuring this transitional period, intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons other than exempt taxable persons should be taxed in the Member State of destination, in accordance with the rates and conditions set by that Member State.\n(11)\nIt is also appropriate that, during that transitional period, intra-Community acquisitions of a certain value, made by exempt persons or by non-taxable legal persons, certain intra-Community distance selling and the supply of new means of transport to individuals or to exempt or non-taxable bodies should also be taxed in the Member State of destination, in accordance with the rates and conditions set by that Member State, in so far as such transactions would, in the absence of special provisions, be likely to cause significant distortion of competition between Member States.\n(12)\nFor reasons connected with their geographic, economic and social situation, certain territories should be excluded from the scope of this Directive.\n(13)\nIn order to enhance the non-discriminatory nature of the tax, the term ‘taxable person’ should be defined in such a way that the Member States may use it to cover persons who occasionally carry out certain transactions.\n(14)\nThe term ‘taxable transaction’ may lead to difficulties, in particular as regards transactions treated as taxable transactions. Those concepts should therefore be clarified.\n(15)\nWith a view to facilitating intra-Community trade in work on movable tangible property, it is appropriate to establish the tax arrangements applicable to such transactions when they are carried out for a customer who is identified for VAT purposes in a Member State other than that in which the transaction is physically carried out.\n(16)\nA transport operation within the territory of a Member State should be treated as the intra-Community transport of goods where it is directly linked to a transport operation carried out between Member States, in order to simplify not only the principles and arrangements for taxing those domestic transport services but also the rules applicable to ancillary services and to services supplied by intermediaries who take part in the supply of the various services.\n(17)\nDetermination of the place where taxable transactions are carried out may engender conflicts concerning jurisdiction as between Member States, in particular as regards the supply of goods for assembly or the supply of services. Although the place where a supply of services is carried out should in principle be fixed as the place where the supplier has established his place of business, it should be defined as being in the Member State of the customer, in particular in the case of certain services supplied between taxable persons where the cost of the services is included in the price of the goods.\n(18)\nIt is necessary to clarify the definition of the place of taxation of certain transactions carried out on board ships, aircraft or trains in the course of passenger transport within the Community.\n(19)\nElectricity and gas are treated as goods for VAT purposes. It is, however, particularly difficult to determine the place of supply. In order to avoid double taxation or non taxation and to attain a genuine internal market free of barriers linked to the VAT regime, the place of supply of gas through the natural gas distribution system, or of electricity, before the goods reach the final stage of consumption, should therefore be the place where the customer has established his business. The supply of electricity and gas at the final stage, that is to say, from traders and distributors to the final consumer, should be taxed at the place where the customer actually uses and consumes the goods.\n(20)\nIn the case of the hiring out of movable tangible property, application of the general rule that supplies of services are taxed in the Member State in which the supplier is established may lead to substantial distortion of competition if the lessor and the lessee are established in different Member States and the rates of taxation in those States differ. It is therefore necessary to establish that the place of supply of a service is the place where the customer has established his business or has a fixed establishment for which the service has been supplied or, in the absence thereof, the place where he has his permanent address or usually resides.\n(21)\nHowever, as regards the hiring out of means of transport, it is appropriate, for reasons of control, to apply strictly the general rule, and thus to regard the place where the supplier has established his business as the place of supply.\n(22)\nAll telecommunications services consumed within the Community should be taxed to prevent distortion of competition in that field. To that end, telecommunications services supplied to taxable persons established in the Community or to customers established in third countries should, in principle, be taxed at the place where the customer for the services is established. In order to ensure uniform taxation of telecommunications services which are supplied by taxable persons established in third territories or third countries to non-taxable persons established in the Community and which are effectively used and enjoyed in the Community, Member States should, however, provide for the place of supply to be within the Community.\n(23)\nAlso to prevent distortions of competition, radio and television broadcasting services and electronically supplied services provided from third territories or third countries to persons established in the Community, or from the Community to customers established in third territories or third countries, should be taxed at the place of establishment of the customer.\n(24)\nThe concepts of chargeable event and of the chargeability of VAT should be harmonised if the introduction of the common system of VAT and of any subsequent amendments thereto are to take effect at the same time in all Member States.\n(25)\nThe taxable amount should be harmonised so that the application of VAT to taxable transactions leads to comparable results in all the Member States.\n(26)\nTo prevent loss of tax revenues through the use of connected parties to derive tax benefits, it should, in specific limited circumstances, be possible for Member States to intervene as regards the taxable amount of supplies of goods or services and intra-Community acquisitions of goods.\n(27)\nIn order to combat tax evasion or avoidance, it should be possible for Member States to include within the taxable amount of a transaction which involves the working of investment gold provided by a customer, the value of that investment gold where, by virtue of being worked, the gold loses its status of investment gold. When they apply these measures, Member States should be allowed a certain degree of discretion.\n(28)\nIf distortions are to be avoided, the abolition of fiscal controls at frontiers entails, not only a uniform basis of assessment, but also sufficient alignment as between Member States of a number of rates and rate levels.\n(29)\nThe standard rate of VAT in force in the various Member States, combined with the mechanism of the transitional system, ensures that this system functions to an acceptable degree. To prevent divergences in the standard rates of VAT applied by the Member States from leading to structural imbalances in the Community and distortions of competition in some sectors of activity, a minimum standard rate of 15 % should be fixed, subject to review.\n(30)\nIn order to preserve neutrality of VAT, the rates applied by Member States should be such as to enable, as a general rule, deduction of the VAT applied at the preceding stage.\n(31)\nDuring the transitional period, certain derogations concerning the number and the level of rates should be possible.\n(32)\nTo achieve a better understanding of the impact of reduced rates, it is necessary for the Commission to prepare an assessment report on the impact of reduced rates applied to locally supplied services, notably in terms of job creation, economic growth and the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(33)\nIn order to tackle the problem of unemployment, those Member States wishing to do so should be allowed to experiment with the operation and impact, in terms of job creation, of a reduction in the VAT rate applied to labour-intensive services. That reduction is also likely to reduce the incentive for the businesses concerned to join or remain in the black economy.\n(34)\nHowever, such a reduction in the VAT rate is not without risk for the smooth functioning of the internal market and for tax neutrality. Provision should therefore be made for an authorisation procedure to be introduced for a period that is fixed but sufficiently long, so that it is possible to assess the impact of the reduced rates applied to locally supplied services. In order to make sure that such a measure remains verifiable and limited, its scope should be closely defined.\n(35)\nA common list of exemptions should be drawn up so that the Communities' own resources may be collected in a uniform manner in all the Member States.\n(36)\nFor the benefit both of the persons liable for payment of VAT and the competent administrative authorities, the methods of applying VAT to certain supplies and intra-Community acquisitions of products subject to excise duty should be aligned with the procedures and obligations concerning the duty to declare in the case of shipment of such products to another Member State laid down in Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (4).\n(37)\nThe supply of gas through the natural gas distribution system, and of electricity is taxed at the place of the customer. In order to avoid double taxation, the importation of such products should therefore be exempted from VAT.\n(38)\nIn respect of taxable operations in the domestic market linked to intra-Community trade in goods carried out during the transitional period by taxable persons not established within the territory of the Member State in which the intra-Community acquisition of goods takes place, including chain transactions, it is necessary to provide for simplification measures ensuring equal treatment in all the Member States. To that end, the provisions concerning the taxation system and the person liable for payment of the VAT due in respect of such operations should be harmonised. It is however, necessary to exclude in principle from such arrangements goods that are intended to be supplied at the retail stage.\n(39)\nThe rules governing deductions should be harmonised to the extent that they affect the actual amounts collected. The deductible proportion should be calculated in a similar manner in all the Member States.\n(40)\nThe scheme which allows the adjustment of deductions for capital goods over the lifetime of the asset, according to its actual use, should also be applicable to certain services with the nature of capital goods.\n(41)\nIt is appropriate to specify the persons liable for payment of VAT, particularly in the case of services supplied by a person who is not established in the Member State in which the VAT is due.\n(42)\nMember States should be able, in specific cases, to designate the recipient of supplies of goods or services as the person liable for payment of VAT. This should assist Member States in simplifying the rules and countering tax evasion and avoidance in identified sectors and on certain types of transactions.\n(43)\nMember States should be entirely free to designate the person liable for payment of the VAT on importation.\n(44)\nMember States should be able to provide that someone other than the person liable for payment of VAT is to be held jointly and severally liable for its payment.\n(45)\nThe obligations of taxable persons should be harmonised as far as possible so as to ensure the necessary safeguards for the collection of VAT in a uniform manner in all the Member States.\n(46)\nThe use of electronic invoicing should allow tax authorities to carry out their monitoring activities. It is therefore appropriate, in order to ensure the internal market functions properly, to draw up a list, harmonised at Community level, of the particulars that must appear on invoices and to establish a number of common arrangements governing the use of electronic invoicing and the electronic storage of invoices, as well as for self-billing and the outsourcing of invoicing operations.\n(47)\nSubject to conditions which they lay down, Member States should allow certain statements and returns to be made by electronic means, and may require that electronic means be used.\n(48)\nThe necessary pursuit of a reduction in the administrative and statistical formalities to be completed by businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, should be reconciled with the implementation of effective control measures and the need, on both economic and tax grounds, to maintain the quality of Community statistical instruments.\n(49)\nMember States should be allowed to continue to apply their special schemes for small enterprises, in accordance with common provisions, and with a view to closer harmonisation.\n(50)\nMember States should remain free to apply a special scheme involving flat rate rebates of input VAT to farmers not covered by the normal scheme. The basic principles of that special scheme should be established and a common method adopted, for the purposes of collecting own resources, for calculating the value added by such farmers.\n(51)\nIt is appropriate to adopt a Community taxation system to be applied to second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors' items, with a view to preventing double taxation and the distortion of competition as between taxable persons.\n(52)\nThe application of the normal VAT rules to gold constitutes a major obstacle to its use for financial investment purposes and therefore justifies the application of a special tax scheme, with a view also to enhancing the international competitiveness of the Community gold market.\n(53)\nThe supply of gold for investment purposes is inherently similar to other financial investments which are exempt from VAT. Consequently, exemption appears to be the most appropriate tax treatment for supplies of investment gold.\n(54)\nThe definition of investment gold should cover gold coins the value of which primarily reflects the price of the gold contained. For reasons of transparency and legal certainty, a yearly list of coins covered by the investment gold scheme should be drawn up, providing security for the operators trading in such coins. That list should be without prejudice to the exemption of coins which are not included in the list but which meet the criteria laid down in this Directive.\n(55)\nIn order to prevent tax evasion while at the same time alleviating the financing burden for the supply of gold of a degree of purity above a certain level, it is justifiable to allow Member States to designate the customer as the person liable for payment of VAT.\n(56)\nIn order to facilitate compliance with fiscal obligations by operators providing electronically supplied services, who are neither established nor required to be identified for VAT purposes within the Community, a special scheme should be established. Under that scheme it should be possible for any operator supplying such services by electronic means to non-taxable persons within the Community, if he is not otherwise identified for VAT purposes within the Community, to opt for identification in a single Member State.\n(57)\nIt is desirable for the provisions concerning radio and television broadcasting and certain electronically supplied services to be put into place on a temporary basis only and to be reviewed in the light of experience within a short period of time.\n(58)\nIt is necessary to promote the uniform application of the provisions of this Directive and to that end an advisory committee on value added taxshould be set up to enable the Member States and the Commission to cooperate closely.\n(59)\nMember States should be able, within certain limits and subject to certain conditions, to introduce, or to continue to apply, special measures derogating from this Directive in order to simplify the levying of tax or to prevent certain forms of tax evasion or avoidance.\n(60)\nIn order to ensure that a Member State which has submitted a request for derogation is not left in doubt as to what action the Commission plans to take in response, time-limits should be laid down within which the Commission must present to the Council either a proposal for authorisation or a communication setting out its objections.\n(61)\nIt is essential to ensure uniform application of the VAT system. Implementing measures are appropriate to realise that aim.\n(62)\nThose measures should, in particular, address the problem of double taxation of cross-border transactions which can occur as the result of divergences between Member States in the application of the rules governing the place where taxable transactions are carried out.\n(63)\nAlthough the scope of the implementing measures would be limited, those measures would have a budgetary impact which for one or more Member States could be significant. Accordingly, the Council is justified in reserving to itself the right to exercise implementing powers.\n(64)\nIn view of their limited scope, the implementing measures should be adopted by the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission.\n(65)\nSince, for those reasons, the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved by at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(66)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the earlier Directives. The obligation to transpose into national law the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directives.\n(67)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States in relation to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives listed in Annex XI, Part B,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTITLE 1 —\nSUBJECT MATTER AND

This Directive establishes the common system of value added tax (VAT).\n2.   The principle of the common system of VAT entails the application to goods and services of a general tax on consumption exactly proportional to the price of the goods and services, however many transactions take place in the production and distribution process before the stage at which the tax is charged.\nOn each transaction, VAT, calculated on the price of the goods or services at the rate applicable to such goods or services, shall be chargeable after deduction of the amount of VAT borne directly by the various cost components.\nThe common system of VAT shall be applied up to and including the retail trade stage.\nArticle 2\n1.   The following transactions shall be subject to VAT:\n(a)\nthe supply of goods for consideration within the territory of a Member State by a taxable person acting as such;\n(b)\nthe intra-Community acquisition of goods for consideration within the territory of a Member State by:\n(i)\na taxable person acting as such, or a non-taxable legal person, where the vendor is a taxable person acting as such who is not eligible for the exemption for small enterprises provided for in Articles 282 to 292 and who is not covered by Articles 33 or 36;\n(ii)\nin the case of new means of transport, a taxable person, or a non-taxable legal person, whose other acquisitions are not subject to VAT pursuant to Article 3(1), or any other non-taxable person;\n(iii)\nin the case of products subject to excise duty, where the excise duty on the intra-Community acquisition is chargeable, pursuant to Directive 92/12/EEC, within the territory of the Member State, a taxable person, or a non-taxable legal person, whose other acquisitions are not subject to VAT pursuant to Article 3(1);\n(c)\nthe supply of services for consideration within the territory of a Member State by a taxable person acting as such;\n(d)\nthe importation of goods.\n2.\n(a)\nFor the purposes of point (ii) of paragraph 1(b), the following shall be regarded as ‘means of transport’, where they are intended for the transport of persons or goods:\n(i)\nmotorised land vehicles the capacity of which exceeds 48 cubic centimetres or the power of which exceeds 7,2 kilowatts;\n(ii)\nvessels exceeding 7,5 metres in length, with the exception of vessels used for navigation on the high seas and carrying passengers for reward, and of vessels used for the purposes of commercial, industrial or fishing activities, or for rescue or assistance at sea, or for inshore fishing;\n(iii)\naircraft the take-off weight of which exceeds 1 550 kilograms, with the exception of aircraft used by airlines operating for reward chiefly on international routes.\n(b)\nThese means of transport shall be regarded as ‘new’ in the cases:\n(i)\nof motorised land vehicles, where the supply takes place within six months of the date of first entry into service or where the vehicle has travelled for no more than 6 000 kilometres;\n(ii)\nof vessels, where the supply takes place within three months of the date of first entry into service or where the vessel has sailed for no more than 100 hours;\n(iii)\nof aircraft, where the supply takes place within three months of the date of first entry into service or where the aircraft has flown for no more than 40 hours.\n(c)\nMember States shall lay down the conditions under which the facts referred to in point (b) may be regarded as established.\n3.   ‘Products subject to excise duty’ shall mean energy products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages and manufactured tobacco, as defined by current Community legislation, but not gas supplied through the natural gas distribution system or electricity.\nArticle 3\n1.

In the case of goods or services used by a taxable person both for transactions in respect of which VAT is deductible pursuant to Articles 168, 169 and 170, and for transactions in respect of which VAT is not deductible, only such proportion of the VAT as is attributable to the former transactions shall be deductible.\nThe deductible proportion shall be determined, in accordance with Articles 174 and 175, for all the transactions carried out by the taxable person.\n2.   Member States may take the following measures:\n(a)\nauthorise the taxable person to determine a proportion for each sector of his business, provided that separate accounts are kept for each sector;\n(b)\nrequire the taxable person to determine a proportion for each sector of his business and to keep separate accounts for each sector;\n(c)\nauthorise or require the taxable person to make the deduction on the basis of the use made of all or part of the goods and services;\n(d)\nauthorise or require the taxable person to make the deduction in accordance with the rule laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, in respect of all goods and services used for all transactions referred to therein;\n(e)\nprovide that, where the VAT which is not deductible by the taxable person is insignificant, it is to be treated as nil.\nArticle 174\n1.

The deductible proportion shall be determined on an annual basis, fixed as a percentage and rounded up to a figure not exceeding the next whole number.\n2.   The provisional proportion for a year shall be that calculated on the basis of the preceding year's transactions. In the absence of any such transactions to refer to, or where they were insignificant in amount, the deductible proportion shall be estimated provisionally, under the supervision of the tax authorities, by the taxable person on the basis of his own forecasts.\nHowever, Member States may retain the rules in force at 1 January 1979 or, in the case of the Member States which acceded to the Community after that date, on the date of their accession.\n3.   Deductions made on the basis of such provisional proportions shall be adjusted when the final proportion is fixed during the following year.\nCHAPTER 3\nRestrictions on the right of deduction\nArticle 176\nThe Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine the expenditure in respect of which VAT shall not be deductible. VAT shall in no circumstances be deductible in respect of expenditure which is not strictly business expenditure, such as that on luxuries, amusements or entertainment.\nPending the entry into force of the provisions referred to in the first paragraph, Member States may retain all the exclusions provided for under their national laws at 1 January 1979 or, in the case of the Member States which acceded to the Community after that date, on the date of their accession.\nArticle 177\nAfter consulting the VAT Committee, each Member State may, for cyclical economic reasons, totally or partly exclude all or some capital goods or other goods from the system of deductions.\nIn order to maintain identical conditions of competition, Member States may, instead of refusing deduction, tax goods manufactured by the taxable person himself or goods which he has purchased within the Community, or imported, in such a way that the tax does not exceed the amount of VAT which would be charged on the acquisition of similar goods.\nCHAPTER 4\nRules governing exercise of the right of deduction\nArticle 178\nIn order to exercise the right of deduction, a taxable person must meet the following conditions:\n(a)\nfor the purposes of deductions pursuant to Article 168(a), in respect of the supply of goods or services, he must hold an invoice drawn up in accordance with Articles 220 to 236 and Articles 238, 239 and 240;\n(b)\nfor the purposes of deductions pursuant to Article 168(b), in respect of transactions treated as the supply of goods or services, he must comply with the formalities as laid down by each Member State;\n(c)\nfor the purposes of deductions pursuant to Article 168(c), in respect of the intra-Community acquisition of goods, he must set out in the VAT return provided for in Article 250 all the information needed for the amount of the VAT due on his intra-Community acquisitions of goods to be calculated and he must hold an invoice drawn up in accordance with Articles 220 to 236;\n(d)\nfor the purposes of deductions pursuant to Article 168(d), in respect of transactions treated as intra-Community acquisitions of goods, he must complete the formalities as laid down by each Member State;\n(e)\nfor the purposes of deductions pursuant to Article 168(e), in respect of the importation of goods, he must hold an import document specifying him as consignee or importer, and stating the amount of VAT due or enabling that amount to be calculated;\n(f)\nwhen required to pay VAT as a customer where Articles 194 to 197 or Article 199 apply, he must comply with the formalities as laid down by each Member State.\nArticle 179\nThe taxable person shall make the deduction by subtracting from the total amount of VAT due for a given tax period the total amount of VAT in respect of which, during the same period, the right of deduction has arisen and is exercised in accordance with Article 178.\nHowever, Member States may require that taxable persons who carry out occasional transactions, as defined in Article 12, exercise their right of deduction only at the time of supply.\nArticle 180\nMember States may authorise a taxable person to make a deduction which he has not made in accordance with Articles 178 and 179.\nArticle 181\nMember States may authorise a taxable person who does not hold an invoice drawn up in accordance with Articles 220 to 236 to make the deduction referred to in Article 168(c) in respect of his intra-Community acquisitions of goods.\nArticle 182\nMember States shall determine the conditions and detailed rules for applying Articles 180 and 181.\nArticle 183\nWhere, for a given tax period, the amount of deductions exceeds the amount of VAT due, the Member States may, in accordance with conditions which they shall determine, either make a refund or carry the excess forward to the following period.\nHowever, Member States may refuse to refund or carry forward if the amount of the excess is insignificant.\nCHAPTER 5\nAdjustment of deductions\nArticle 184\nThe initial deduction shall be adjusted where it is higher or lower than that to which the taxable person was entitled.\nArticle 185\n1.   Adjustment shall, in particular, be made where, after the VAT return is made, some change occurs in the factors used to determine the amount to be deducted, for example where purchases are cancelled or price reductions are obtained.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, no adjustment shall be made in the case of transactions remaining totally or partially unpaid or in the case of destruction, loss or theft of property duly proved or confirmed, or in the case of goods reserved for the purpose of making gifts of small value or of giving samples, as referred to in Article 16.\nHowever, in the case of transactions remaining totally or partially unpaid or in the case of theft, Member States may require adjustment to be made.\nArticle 186\nMember States shall lay down the detailed rules for applying Articles 184 and 185.\nArticle 187\n1.   In the case of capital goods, adjustment shall be spread over five years including that in which the goods were acquired or manufactured.\nMember States may, however, base the adjustment on a period of five full years starting from the time at which the goods are first used.\nIn the case of immovable property acquired as capital goods, the adjustment period may be extended up to 20 years.\n2.   The annual adjustment shall be made only in respect of one-fifth of the VAT charged on the capital goods, or, if the adjustment period has been extended, in respect of the corresponding fraction thereof.\nThe adjustment referred to in the first subparagraph shall be made on the basis of the variations in the deduction entitlement in subsequent years in relation to that for the year in which the goods were acquired, manufactured or, where applicable, used for the first time.\nArticle 188\n1.   If supplied during the adjustment period, capital goods shall be treated as if they had been applied to an economic activity of the taxable person up until expiry of the adjustment period.\nThe economic activity shall be presumed to be fully taxed in cases where the supply of the capital goods is taxed.\nThe economic activity shall be presumed to be fully exempt in cases where the supply of the capital goods is exempt.\n2.   The adjustment provided for in paragraph 1 shall be made only once in respect of all the time covered by the adjustment period that remains to run. However, where the supply of capital goods is exempt, Member States may waive the requirement for adjustment in so far as the purchaser is a taxable person using the capital goods in question solely for transactions in respect of which VAT is deductible.\nArticle 189\nFor the purposes of applying Articles 187 and 188, Member States may take the following measures:\n(a)\ndefine the concept of capital goods;\n(b)\nspecify the amount of the VAT which is to be taken into consideration for adjustment;\n(c)\nadopt any measures needed to ensure that adjustment does not give rise to any unjustified advantage;\n(d)\npermit administrative simplifications.\nArticle 190\nFor the purposes of Articles 187, 188, 189 and 191, Member States may regard as capital goods those services which have characteristics similar to those normally attributed to capital goods.\nArticle 191\nIf, in any Member State, the practical effect of applying Articles 187 and 188 is negligible, that Member State may, after consulting the VAT Committee, refrain from applying those provisions, having regard to the overall impact of VAT in the Member State concerned and the need for administrative simplification, and provided that no distortion of competition thereby arises.\nArticle 192\nWhere a taxable person transfers from being taxed in the normal way to a special scheme or vice versa, Member States may take all measures necessary to ensure that the taxable person does not enjoy unjustified advantage or sustain unjustified harm.\nTITLE XI\nOBLIGATIONS OF TAXABLE PERSONS AND CERTAIN NON-TAXABLE PERSONS\nCHAPTER 1\nObligation to pay\nSection 1\nPersons liable for payment of VAT to the tax authorities\nArticle 193\nVAT shall be payable by any taxable person carrying out a taxable supply of goods or services, except where it is payable by another person in the cases referred to in Articles 194 to 199 and Article 202.\nArticle 194\n1.

Member States shall lay down the conditions for implementation of paragraph 1.\nArticle 195\nVAT shall be payable by any person who is identified for VAT purposes in the Member State in which the tax is due and to whom goods are supplied in the circumstances specified in Articles 38 or 39, if the supplies are carried out by a taxable person not established within that Member State.\nArticle 196\nVAT shall be payable by any taxable person to whom the services referred to in Article 56 are supplied or by any person identified for VAT purposes in the Member State in which the tax is due to whom the services referred to in Articles 44, 47, 50, 53, 54 and 55 are supplied, if the services are supplied by a taxable person not established in that Member State.\nArticle 197\n1.   VAT shall be payable by the person to whom the goods are supplied when the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe taxable transaction is a supply of goods carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 141;\n(b)\nthe person to whom the goods are supplied is another taxable person, or a non-taxable legal person, identified for VAT purposes in the Member State in which the supply is carried out;\n(c)\nthe invoice issued by the taxable person not established in the Member State of the person to whom the goods are supplied is drawn up in accordance with Articles 220 to 236.\n2.

Where specific transactions relating to investment gold between a taxable person who is a member of a regulated gold bullion market and another taxable person who is not a member of that market are taxed pursuant to Article 352, Member States shall designate the customer as the person liable for payment of VAT.\nIf the customer who is not a member of the regulated gold bullion market is a taxable person required to be identified for VAT purposes in the Member State in which the tax is due solely in respect of the transactions referred to in Article 352, the vendor shall fulfil the tax obligations on behalf of the customer, in accordance with the law of that Member State.\n2.   Where gold material or semi-manufactured products of a purity of 325 thousandths or greater, or investment gold as defined in Article 344(1) is supplied by a taxable person exercising one of the options under Articles 348, 349 and 350, Member States may designate the customer as the person liable for payment of VAT.\n3.   Member States shall lay down the procedures and conditions for implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.\nArticle 199\n1.   Member States may provide that the person liable for payment of VAT is the taxable person to whom any of the following supplies are made:\n(a)\nthe supply of construction work, including repair, cleaning, maintenance, alteration and demolition services in relation to immovable property, as well as the handing over of construction works regarded as a supply of goods pursuant to Article 14(3);\n(b)\nthe supply of staff engaged in activities covered by point (a);\n(c)\nthe supply of immovable property, as referred to in Article 135(1)(j) and (k), where the supplier has opted for taxation of the supply pursuant to Article 137;\n(d)\nthe supply of used material, used material which cannot be re-used in the same state, scrap, industrial and non industrial waste, recyclable waste, part processed waste and certain goods and services, as listed in Annex VI;\n(e)\nthe supply of goods provided as security by one taxable person to another in execution of that security;\n(f)\nthe supply of goods following the cession of a reservation of ownership to an assignee and the exercising of this right by the assignee;\n(g)\nthe supply of immovable property sold by a judgment debtor in a compulsory sale procedure.\n2.   When applying the option provided for in paragraph 1, Member States may specify the supplies of goods and services covered, and the categories of suppliers or recipients to whom these measures may apply.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, Member States may take the following measures:\n(a)\nprovide that a taxable person who also carries out activities or transactions that are not considered to be taxable supplies of goods or services in accordance with Article 2 shall be regarded as a taxable person in respect of supplies received as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article;\n(b)\nprovide that a non-taxable body governed by public law, shall be regarded as a taxable person in respect of supplies received as referred to in points (e), (f) and (g) of paragraph 1.\n4.

In addition to the case referred to in paragraph 1, the use after the date of accession within the territory of a Member State, by a taxable or non-taxable person, of goods supplied to him before the date of accession within the territory of the Community or one of the new Member States shall be treated as an importation of goods where the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe supply of those goods has been exempted, or was likely to be exempted, either under points (a) and (b) of Article 146(1) or under a similar provision in the new Member States;\n(b)\nthe goods were not imported into one of the new Member States or into the Community before the date of accession.\nArticle 409\nIn the cases referred to in Article 408(1), the place of import within the meaning of Article 61 shall be the Member State within whose territory the goods cease to be covered by the arrangements or situations under which they were placed before the date of accession.\nArticle 410\n1.

Union’s common system of value added tax (VAT)\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2006/112/EC – the European Union’s common system of value added tax\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt recasts and repeals the sixth value added tax (VAT) directive in order to clarify the current VAT legislation in the European Union (EU).\nKEY POINTS\n              \nVAT is applied to all transactions carried out in the EU for payment by a taxable person (i.e. an individual or a business that supplies goods and services in the course of their work). Imports by any person are also subject to VAT.\nTaxable transactions include supplies of goods or services within the EU, acquisitions of goods between EU Member States (goods supplied in and dispatched or transported by a business from one Member State to a business in another) and imports of goods into the EU from non-EU countries.\nThe place of taxation depends on the nature of the transaction, the kind of product supplied and whether transport is involved. Supply of goods. Where the goods are supplied.Acquisition of goods between Member States. Where the goods are delivered (i.e. the Member State where the goods finally arrive after transport from another Member State).Imports of goods. Usually the Member State where the goods arrive.Supply of services. Where the services are said to be supplied. This depends not only on the type of service supplied, but also on the type of customer receiving the service. The general rule is that a service is taxed at the place of the customer if it is a business, or at the place of the supplier if the customer is a private individual. To ensure that the service is taxed at the place where it is actually used, there are some exceptions to these general rules, such as: services connected with immovable property (real estate);passenger transport;activities relating to culture, sport, education and entertainment;restaurant services.\nVAT is charged when the goods or services are supplied, according to the nature of the transaction. VAT may be charged for an acquisition of goods between Member States when the supply of goods to the relevant Member State is completed. For imports into the EU, VAT is charged when the goods are brought into a Member State.\nThe taxable amount for supply of goods and services and the acquisition of goods between Member States includes all payments to the supplier. Where goods are imported, this amount is their value for customs purposes. Duties, taxes and other charges are included in the taxable amount, but the VAT itself, price discounts and rebates granted to the customer are excluded.\nThe standard rate of VAT to be applied by all Member States to goods and services is at least 15%. Member States may apply one or two reduced rates of at least 5% to specific goods or services listed in Annex III to the directive. A number of exceptions to these rules (e.g. lower rates on other goods or services) also apply under certain conditions.\nThe directive allows for exemptions from VAT. Most of these are exemptions without the right to deduct (e.g. medical care, social services or financial and insurance services). However, exemptions with the right to deduct also exist (e.g. supplies of goods between Member States or exports of goods to a non-EU country). Most exemptions are compulsory for Member States, but some are optional.\nA taxable person may deduct the amount of VAT paid on acquired goods or services used for taxed transactions in the Member State where these goods or services are acquired. This input VAT can be deducted from VAT payable on taxed transactions (e.g. domestic supplies of goods or services). There is generally no right to deduct in the case of an economic activity that is exempt from VAT, or if the taxable person applies certain special schemes. In certain cases, deductions may be limited or adjusted.\nThe directive sets out the obligations of taxable and certain non-taxable persons. Generally, VAT is payable by any taxable person making a taxable supply of goods or services. Exceptions include specific transactions where the customer pays VAT (e.g. services provided to a business by a supplier in another country, and transactions where the Member State may choose to designate the customer to pay VAT, as with certain fraud-sensitive supplies).\nThe directive permits exceptions by the Member States from standard VAT rules (e.g. to prevent certain types of tax evasion). There are also special VAT schemes designed to reduce paperwork (e.g. for small businesses and for farmers).\nIn addition, it allows the Member States that are most severely affected by VAT fraud to temporarily apply a generalised reversal of VAT liability. This involves shifting liability for paying the VAT from the supplier to the customer. The Member States may use this measure only for supplies of goods and services in their own country of more than €17,500 per transaction, only until 30 June 2022 and under very strict conditions.\nA number of amendments have been made to Directive 2006/112/EC, including some amendments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDirective (EU) 2020/284 amends the directive, introducing certain requirements on payment service providers to keep records of e-commerce cross-border payments. The data will then be made available to national tax authorities under strict conditions, including those related to data protection. These requirements apply from 1 January 2024.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2020/285 introduces simplified rules to reduce the administrative burden and compliance costs for small businesses, and to create a more advantageous tax environment to help them grow and trade across borders more efficiently. Small businesses will be able to qualify for simplified VAT compliance rules, where their annual turnover remains below a threshold set by the Member State concerned, which cannot be higher than €85,000. Under certain conditions, small businesses from other Member States that do not exceed this threshold will also be able to benefit from the simplified scheme, if their total annual turnover in the whole of the EU does not exceed €100,000. These new rules apply from 1 January 2025.\nThe VAT e-commerce package (Directives (EU) 2017/2455 and (EU) 2019/1995, both amending Directive 2006/112/EC) introduced new simplifications for companies carrying out cross-border sales of goods or services. It ensures that VAT on such supplies is paid correctly to the Member State of the customer, in line with the principle of taxation in the Member State of destination. The first measures entered into force in 2015 and covered only telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services. Businesses providing business-to-consumer supplies of goods or services in the EU can now declare and pay VAT in a simplified system (one-stop shop).\nAs a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, Decision (EU) 2020/1109 postpones the date of entry into force of the second package from 1 January 2021 to 1 July 2021, in order to allow Member States and businesses to have more time to prepare for the new rules.\nDirective (EU) 2020/1756 amends Directive 2006/112/EC, following the United Kingdom’s (UK) withdrawal from the EU, introducing VAT identification numbers in Northern Ireland with a specific prefix to distinguish between: taxable persons and non-taxable legal persons, whose transactions involving goods in Northern Ireland are subject to EU VAT legislation;persons carrying out other transactions, for which they are identified for VAT purposes in the UK.\nDirective (EU) 2020/2020 amends the directive to ensure more affordable access to supplies of COVID-19 vaccines and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (test kits) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. From 12 December 2020 until 31 December 2022, it allows Member States to: exempt from VAT with the right to deduct the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, and services closely related to these vaccines and devices;apply a reduced rate of VAT to COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic medical devices and related services, as is already the case for vaccines.\nDirective (EU) 2021/1159 amends Directive 2006/112/EC as regards temporary exemptions on imports and on certain supplies, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will make it easier for the European Commission and EU agencies to buy goods and services in order to distribute them free of charge (i.e. as donations) to Member States in the context of the ongoing public health crisis.\nReform of the VAT system\nAs part of the reform proposed in the Commission’s 2016 action plan on VAT, amending Directive (EU) 2022/542 amends Directive 2006/112/EC by:\nupdating the list of goods and services for which reduced VAT rates are allowed (Annex III); however, the number of items to which reduced rates can be applied is limited to prevent a proliferation of reduced rates;\nopening up the existing exceptions allowing certain Member States to apply preferential rates to certain products to all Member States, provided they are compatible with the agreed principles;\nphasing out periods for reduced rates or exceptions applied to products with a negative impact on the environment (e.g. on fossil fuels and other goods with a similar impact on greenhouse gas emissions, which no longer apply from 1 January 2030 at the latest, and on chemical pesticides and fertilisers, which no longer apply from 1 January 2032 at the latest);\nallowing Member States to apply a reduced rate, in particular, to: internet access services to address the low coverage of these services and promote their development,solar panels, electric bicycles and waste recycling services considered to be environmentally friendly goods and services,goods and services serving specific social and cultural policy purposes.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2006/112/EC has applied since 1 January 2007 and had to become law in the Member States by 1 January 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nVAT (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, pp. 1–118).\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2006/112/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
