04/02/2006 P. 0056 - 0079\nANNEX APROTOCOL ON POLLUTANT RELEASE AND TRANSFER REGISTERSThe Parties to this Protocol,Recalling Article 5(9), and Article 10(2), of the 1998 Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention),Recognising that pollutant release and transfer registers provide an important mechanism to increase corporate accountability, reduce pollution and promote sustainable development, as stated in the Lucca Declaration adopted at the first meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention,Having regard to principle 10 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,Having regard also to the principles and commitments agreed to at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in particular the provisions in chapter 19 of Agenda 21,Taking note of the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its 19th special session, 1997, in which it called for, inter alia, enhanced national capacities and capabilities for information collection, processing and dissemination, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means,Having regard to the Plan of Implementation of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, which encourages the development of coherent, integrated information on chemicals, such as through national pollutant release and transfer registers,Taking into account the work of the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety, in particular the 2000 Bahia Declaration on Chemical Safety, the Priorities for Action Beyond 2000 and the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register/Emission Inventory Action Plan,Taking into account also the activities undertaken within the framework of the Inter-Organisation Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals,Taking into account, furthermore, the work of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in particular its Council Recommendation on Implementing Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers, in which the Council calls upon member countries to establish and make publicly available national pollutant release and transfer registers,Wishing to provide a mechanism contributing to the ability of every person of present and future generations to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and well-being, by ensuring the development of publicly accessible environmental information systems,Wishing also to ensure that the development of such systems takes into account principles contributing to sustainable development such as the precautionary approach set forth in principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,Recognising the link between adequate environmental information systems and the exercise of the rights contained in the Aarhus Convention,Noting the need for cooperation with other international initiatives concerning pollutants and waste, including the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal,Recognising that the objectives of an integrated approach to minimising pollution and the amount of waste resulting from the operation of industrial installations and other sources are to achieve a high level of protection for the environment as a whole, to move towards sustainable and environmentally sound development and to protect the health of present and future generations,Convinced of the value of pollutant release and transfer registers as a cost-effective tool for encouraging improvements in environmental performance, for providing public access to information on pollutants released into and transferred in and through communities, and for use by Governments in tracking trends, demonstrating progress in pollution reduction, monitoring compliance with certain international agreements, setting priorities and evaluating progress achieved through environmental policies and programmes,Believing that pollutant release and transfer registers can bring tangible benefits to industry through the improved management of pollutants,Noting the opportunities for using data from pollutant release and transfer registers, combined with health, environmental, demographic, economic or other types of relevant information, for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of potential problems, identifying \"hot spots\", taking preventive and mitigating measures, and setting environmental management priorities,Recognising the importance of protecting the privacy of identified or identifiable natural persons in the processing of information reported to pollutant release and transfer registers in accordance with applicable international standards relating to data protection,Recognising also the importance of developing internationally compatible national pollutant release and transfer register systems to increase the comparability of data,Noting that many Member States of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the European Community and the Parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement are acting to collect data on pollutant releases and transfers from various sources and to make these data publicly accessible, and recognising, especially in this area, the long and valuable experience in certain countries,Taking into account the different approaches in existing emission registers and the need to avoid duplication, and recognising therefore that a certain degree of flexibility is needed,Urging the progressive development of national pollutant release and transfer registers,Urging also the establishment of links between national pollutant release and transfer registers and information systems on other releases of public concern,HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:Article 1ObjectiveThe objective of this Protocol is to enhance public access to information through the establishment of coherent, integrated, nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol, which could facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making as well as contribute to the prevention and reduction of pollution of the environment.Article 2DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Protocol,1. \"Party\" means, unless the text indicates otherwise, a State or a regional economic integration organisation referred to in Article 24 which has consented to be bound by this Protocol and for which the Protocol is in force;2. \"Convention\" means the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, done at Aarhus, Denmark, on 25 June 1998;3. \"the public\" means one or more natural or legal persons, and, in accordance with national legislation or practice, their associations, organisations or groups;4. \"facility\" means one or more installations on the same site, or on adjoining sites, that are owned or operated by the same natural or legal person;5. \"competent authority\" means the national authority or authorities, or any other competent body or bodies, designated by a Party to

The provisions of this Protocol shall not affect the right of a Party to maintain or introduce a more extensive or more publicly accessible pollutant release and transfer register than required by this Protocol.3. Each Party shall take the necessary measures to require that employees of a facility and members of the public who report a violation by a facility of national laws implementing this Protocol to public authorities are not penalised, persecuted or harassed by that facility or public authorities for their actions in reporting the violation.4. In the implementation of this Protocol, each Party shall be guided by the precautionary approach as set forth in principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.5. To reduce duplicative reporting, pollutant release and transfer register systems may be integrated to the degree practicable with existing information sources such as reporting mechanisms under licences or operating permits.6. Parties shall strive to achieve convergence among national pollutant release and transfer registers.Article 4Core elements of a pollutant release and transfer register systemIn accordance with this Protocol, each Party shall establish and maintain a publicly accessible national pollutant release and transfer register that:(a) is facility-specific with respect to reporting on point sources;(b) accommodates reporting on diffuse sources;(c) is pollutant-specific or waste-specific, as appropriate;(d) is multimedia, distinguishing among releases to air, land and water;(e) includes information on transfers;(f) is based on mandatory reporting on a periodic basis;(g) includes standardised and timely data, a limited number of standardised reporting thresholds and limited provisions, if any, for confidentiality;(h) is coherent and designed to be user-friendly and publicly accessible, including in electronic form;(i) allows for public participation in its development and modification; and(j) is a structured, computerised database or several linked databases maintained by the competent authority.Article 5Design and structure1. Each Party shall ensure that the data held on the register referred to in Article 4 are presented in both aggregated and non-aggregated forms, so that releases and transfers can be searched and identified according to:(a) facility and its geographical location;(b) activity;(c) owner or operator, and, as appropriate, company;(d) pollutant or waste, as appropriate;(e) each of the environmental media into which the pollutant is released; and(f) as specified in Article 7, paragraph 5, the destination of the transfer and, where appropriate, the disposal or recovery operation for waste.2. Each Party shall also ensure that the data can be searched and identified according to those diffuse sources which have been included in the register.3. Each Party shall design its register taking into account the possibility of its future expansion and ensuring that the reporting data from at least the 10 previous reporting years are publicly accessible.4. The register shall be designed for maximum ease of public access through electronic means, such as the Internet. The design shall allow that, under normal operating conditions, the information on the register is continuously and immediately available through electronic means.5. Each Party should provide links in its register to its relevant existing, publicly accessible databases on subject matters related to environmental protection.6. Each Party shall provide links in its register to the pollutant release and transfer registers of other Parties to the Protocol and, where feasible, to those of other countries.Article 6Scope of the register1. Each Party shall ensure that its register includes the information on:(a) releases of pollutants required to be reported pursuant to Article 7(2);(b) off-site transfers required to be reported pursuant to Article 7(2); and(c) releases of pollutants from diffuse sources required pursuant to Article 7(4).2. Having assessed the experience gained from the development of national pollutant release and transfer registers and the implementation of this Protocol, and taking into account relevant international processes, the Meeting of the Parties shall review the reporting requirements under this Protocol and shall consider the following issues in its further development:(a) revision of the activities specified in Annex I;(b) revision of the pollutants specified in Annex II;(c) revision of the thresholds in Annexes I and II; and(d) inclusion of other relevant aspects such as information on on-site transfers, storage, the specification of reporting requirements for diffuse sources or the development of criteria for including pollutants under this Protocol.Article 7Reporting requirements1. Each Party shall either:(a) require the owner or the operator of each individual facility within its jurisdiction that undertakes one or more of the activities specified in Annex I above the applicable capacity threshold specified in Annex I, column 1, and:(i) releases any pollutant specified in Annex II in quantities exceeding the applicable thresholds specified in Annex II, column 1;(ii) transfers off-site any pollutant specified in Annex II in quantities exceeding the applicable threshold specified in Annex II, column 2, where the Party has opted for pollutant-specific reporting of transfers pursuant to paragraph 5(d);(iii) transfers off-site hazardous waste exceeding two tons per year or other waste exceeding 2000 tons per year, where the Party has opted for waste-specific reporting of transfers pursuant to paragraph 5(d); or(iv) transfers off-site any pollutant specified in Annex II in waste water destined for waste-water treatment in quantities exceeding the applicable threshold specified in Annex II, column 1b;to undertake the obligation imposed on that owner or operator pursuant to paragraph 2; or(b) require the owner or the operator of each individual facility within its jurisdiction that undertakes one or more of the activities specified in Annex I at or above the employee threshold specified in Annex I, column 2, and manufactures, processes or uses any pollutant specified in Annex II in quantities exceeding the applicable threshold specified in Annex II, column 3, to undertake the obligation imposed on that owner or operator pursuant to paragraph 2.2. Each Party shall require the owner or operator of a facility referred to in paragraph 1 to submit the information specified in paragraphs 5 and 6, and in accordance with the requirements therein, with respect to those pollutants and wastes for which thresholds were exceeded.3. In order to achieve the objective of this Protocol, a Party may decide with respect to a particular pollutant to apply either a release threshold or a manufacture, process or use threshold, provided that this increases the relevant information on releases or transfers available in its register.4. Each Party shall ensure that its competent authority collects, or shall designate one or more public authorities or competent bodies to collect, the information on releases of pollutants from diffuse sources specified in paragraphs 7 and 8, for inclusion in its register.5. Each Party shall require the owners or operators of the facilities required to report under paragraph 2 to complete and submit to its competent authority, the following information on a facility-specific basis:(a) the name, street address, geographical location and the activity or activities of the reporting facility, and the name of the owner or operator, and, as appropriate, company;(b) the name and numerical identifier of each pollutant required to be reported pursuant to paragraph 2;(c) the amount of each pollutant required to be reported pursuant to paragraph 2 released from the facility to the environment in the reporting year, both in aggregate and according to whether the release is to air, to water or to land, including by underground injection;(d) either:(i) the amount of each pollutant required to be reported pursuant to paragraph 2 that is transferred off-site in the reporting year, distinguishing between the amounts transferred for disposal and for recovery, and the name and address of the facility receiving the transfer; or(ii) the amount of waste required to be reported pursuant to paragraph 2 transferred off-site in the reporting year, distinguishing between hazardous waste and other waste, for any operations of recovery or disposal, indicating respectively with \"R\" or \"D\" whether the waste is destined for disposal or recovery pursuant to Annex III and, for transboundary movements of hazardous waste, the name and address of the disposer or recoverer of the waste and the actual disposal or recovery site receiving the transfer;(e) the amount of each pollutant in waste water required to be reported pursuant to paragraph 2 transferred off-site in the reporting year; and(f) the type of methodology used to derive the information referred to in subparagraphs (c) to (e), according to Article 9(2), indicating whether the information is based on measurement, calculation or estimation.6. The information referred to in paragraph 5(c) to (e) shall include information on releases and transfers resulting from routine activities and from extraordinary events.7. Each Party shall present on its register, in an adequate spatial disaggregation, the information on releases of pollutants from diffuse sources for which that Party determines that data are being collected by the relevant authorities and can be practicably included. Where the Party determines that no such data exist, it shall take measures to initiate reporting on releases of relevant pollutants from one or more diffuse sources in accordance with its national priorities.8. The information referred to in paragraph 7 shall include information on the type of methodology used to derive the information.Article 8Reporting cycle1. Each Party shall ensure that the information required to be incorporated in its register is publicly available, compiled and presented on the register by calendar year. The reporting year is the calendar year to which that information relates. For each Party, the first reporting year is the calendar year after the Protocol enters into force for that Party. The reporting required pursuant to Article 7 shall be annual. However, the second reporting year may be the second calendar year following the first reporting year.2. Each Party that is not a regional economic integration organisation shall ensure that the information is incorporated into its register within 15 months from the end of each reporting year. However, the information for the first reporting year shall be incorporated into its register within two years from the end of that reporting year.3. Each Party that is a regional economic integration organisation shall ensure that the information for a particular reporting year is incorporated into its register six months after the Parties that are not regional economic integration organisations are required to do so.Article 9Data collection and record-keeping1. Each Party shall require the owners or operators of the facilities subject to the reporting requirements of Article 7 to collect the data needed to determine, in accordance with paragraph 2 below and with appropriate frequency, the facility’s releases and off-site transfers subject to reporting pursuant to Article 7 and to keep available for the competent authorities the records of the data from which the reported information was derived for a period of five years, starting from the end of the reporting year concerned. These records shall also describe the methodology used for data gathering.2. Each Party shall require the owners or operators of the facilities subject to reporting pursuant to Article 7, to use the best available information, which may include monitoring data, emission factors, mass balance equations, indirect monitoring or other calculations, engineering judgments and other methods. Where appropriate, this should be done in accordance with internationally approved methodologies.Article 10Quality assessment1. Each Party shall require the owners or operators of the facilities subject to the reporting requirements of Article 7(1), to assure the quality of the information that they report.2. Each Party shall ensure that the data contained in its register are subject to quality assessment by the competent authority, in particular as to their completeness, consistency and credibility, taking into account any guidelines that may be developed by the Meeting of the Parties.Article 11Public access to information1.
