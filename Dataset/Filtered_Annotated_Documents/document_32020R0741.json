{"celex_id": "32020R0741", "reference": "5.6.2020\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 177/32\nREGULATION (EU) 2020/741 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 25 May 2020\non minimum requirements for water reuse\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe water resources of the Union are increasingly coming under pressure, leading to water scarcity and a deterioration in water quality. In particular, climate change, unpredictable weather patterns and drought are contributing significantly to the strain on the availability of freshwater, arising from urban development and agriculture.\n(2)\nThe Union’s ability to respond to the increasing pressures on water resources could be improved by wider reuse of treated waste water, limiting extraction from surface water bodies and groundwater bodies, reducing the impact of discharge of treated waste water into water bodies, and promoting water savings through multiple uses for urban waste water, while ensuring a high level of environmental protection. Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) mentions water reuse, in combination with the promotion of the use of water-efficient technologies in industry and water-saving irrigation techniques, as one of the supplementary measures Member States may choose to apply to achieve that Directive’s objectives of good qualitative and quantitative water status for surface water bodies and groundwater bodies. Council Directive 91/271/EEC (5) requires that treated waste water be reused whenever appropriate.\n(3)\nThe communication of the Commission of 14 November 2012‘A Blueprint to Safeguard Europe’s Water Resources’ points to the need to create an instrument to regulate standards at Union level for water reuse, in order to remove the obstacles to a widespread use of such an alternative water supply option, namely one that can help to reduce water scarcity and lessen the vulnerability of supply systems.\n(4)\nThe communication of the Commission of 18 July 2007‘Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union’ sets out the hierarchy of measures that Member States should consider in managing water scarcity and droughts. It states that in regions where all preventive measures have been implemented according to the water hierarchy and where demand for water still exceeds availability, additional water supply infrastructure can in some circumstances, and taking due account of the cost-benefit dimension, serve as an alternative approach to mitigate the impacts of severe drought.\n(5)\nIn its resolution of 9 October 2008 on addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union (6), the European Parliament recalls that a demand-side approach should be preferred when managing water resources, but considers that the Union should adopt a holistic approach when managing water resources, combining measures of demand management, measures to optimise existing resources within the water cycle and measures to create new resources, and that the approach needs to integrate environmental, social and economic considerations.\n(6)\nIn its communication of 2 December 2015‘Closing the loop – An EU action plan for the Circular Economy’, the Commission committed to taking a series of actions to promote the reuse of treated waste water, including the development of a legislative proposal on minimum requirements for water reuse. The Commission should update its action plan and keep water resources as a priority area in which to intervene.\n(7)\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to facilitate the uptake of water reuse whenever it is appropriate and cost-efficient, thereby creating an enabling framework for those Member States who wish or need to practise water reuse. Water reuse is a promising option for many Member States, but currently only a small number of them practice water reuse and have adopted national legislation or standards in that regard. This Regulation should be flexible enough to allow the continuation of the practice of water reuse and at the same time to ensure that it is possible for other Member States to apply those rules when they decide to introduce this practice at a later stage. Any decision not to practise water reuse should be duly justified based on the criteria laid down in this Regulation and reviewed regularly.\n(8)\nDirective 2000/60/EC provides Member States with the necessary flexibility to include supplementary measures in the programmes of measures that they adopt to support their efforts to achieve the water quality objectives established by that Directive. The non-exclusive list of supplementary measures provided for in Part B of Annex VI to Directive 2000/60/EC contains, among others, water reuse measures. In this context and in line with a hierarchy of measures that could be considered by the Member States in managing water scarcity and droughts and that encourages measures ranging from water saving to water pricing policy and alternative solutions, and taking due account of the cost-benefit dimension, the minimum requirements for water reuse, as established by this Regulation, should be applicable whenever treated urban waste water from urban waste water treatment plants is reused, in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC, for agricultural irrigation.\n(9)\nReuse of properly treated waste water, for example from urban waste water treatment plants, is considered to have a lower environmental impact than other alternative water supply methods, such as water transfers or desalination. However, such water reuse, which could reduce water wastage and save water, is practised only to a limited extent in the Union. This appears to be partly due to the significant cost of waste water reuse systems and the lack of common Union environmental and health standards for water reuse, and, as regards, in particular, agricultural products, due to the potential health and environmental risks and potential obstacles to the free movement of such products which have been irrigated with reclaimed water.\n(10)\nHealth standards in relation to food hygiene for agricultural products irrigated with reclaimed water can be achieved only if quality requirements for reclaimed water intended for agricultural irrigation do not differ significantly between the Member States. Harmonisation of requirements would also contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market in relation to such products. It is therefore appropriate to introduce minimum levels of harmonisation by setting minimum requirements for water quality and monitoring. Those minimum requirements should consist of minimum parameters for reclaimed water that are based on the technical reports of the Commission’s Joint Research Centre and reflect international standards on water reuse, and other stricter or additional quality requirements imposed, if necessary, by competent authorities together with any relevant preventive measures.\n(11)\nWater reuse for agricultural irrigation can also contribute to the promotion of the circular economy by recovering nutrients from the reclaimed water and applying them to crops, by means of fertigation techniques. Thus, water reuse could potentially reduce the need for supplemental applications of mineral fertiliser. End-users should be informed about the nutrient content of reclaimed water.\n(12)\nWater reuse could contribute to the recovery of the nutrients contained in treated urban waste water, and the use of reclaimed water for irrigation purposes in agriculture or forestry could be a way of restoring nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, to natural biogeochemical cycles.\n(13)\nThe high investment needed to upgrade urban waste water treatment plants and the lack of financial incentives for practising water reuse in agriculture have been identified as being among the reasons for the low uptake of water reuse in the Union. It should be possible to address those issues by promoting innovative schemes and economic incentives to appropriately take account of the costs and the socioeconomic and environmental benefits of water reuse.\n(14)\nCompliance with minimum requirements for water reuse should be consistent with Union water policy and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular Goal 6, to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, as well as a substantial increase in recycling of water and safe water reuse globally with a view to contributing to achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12 on sustainable consumption and production. Furthermore, this Regulation should seek to ensure the application of Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union on environmental protection.\n(15)\nIn some cases, reclamation facility operators still transport and store reclaimed water beyond the outlet of the reclamation facility, prior to delivering it to the next actors in the chain, such as the reclaimed water distribution operator, the reclaimed water storage operator or the end-user. It is necessary to define the point of compliance, to clarify where the responsibility of the reclamation facility operator ends and where the responsibility of the next actor in the chain starts.\n(16)\nRisk management should comprise the identification and management of risks in a proactive way, and should incorporate the concept of producing reclaimed water of a specific quality required for particular uses. Risk assessment should be based on key elements of risk management and should identify any additional water quality requirements necessary to ensure sufficient protection of the environment and of human and animal health. For that purpose, water reuse risk management plans should ensure that reclaimed water is safely used and managed and that there are no risks to the environment or to human or animal health. In order to develop such risk management plans, existing international guidance or standards, such as ISO 20426:2018 Guidelines for health risk assessment and management for non-potable water reuse, ISO 16075:2015 Guidelines for treated waste water use for irrigation projects, or World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines could be used.\n(17)\nThe quality requirements for water intended for human consumption are laid down in Council Directive 98/83/EC (7). Member States should take appropriate measures to ensure that water reuse activities do not lead to a deterioration in the quality of water intended for human consumption. For that reason, the water reuse risk management plan should pay special attention to the protection of water bodies used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption and relevant safeguard zones.\n(18)\nCooperation and interaction between the various parties involved in the water reclamation process should be a precondition for setting up reclamation treatment procedures in accordance with the requirements for specific uses, and in order to be able to plan the supply of reclaimed water in line with demand from end-users.\n(19)\nIn order to effectively protect the environment and human and animal health, reclamation facility operators should be primarily responsible for the quality of reclaimed water at the point of compliance. For the purposes of compliance with the minimum requirements laid down under this Regulation and with any additional conditions set by the competent authority, reclamation facility operators should monitor the quality of reclaimed water. It is therefore appropriate to establish the minimum requirements for monitoring, consisting of the frequencies of the routine monitoring and the timing and performance targets for validation monitoring. Certain requirements for routine monitoring are provided for in Directive 91/271/EEC.\n(20)\nThis Regulation should cover reclaimed water which is obtained from waste water that has been collected in collecting systems, that has been treated in urban waste water treatment plants in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC and that undergoes further treatment, either in the urban waste water treatment plant or in a reclamation facility, in order to meet the parameters set out in Annex I to this Regulation. In accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC, agglomerations of less than 2 000 population equivalent (p.e.) do not have to be provided with a collecting system. However, urban waste water from agglomerations of less than 2 000 p.e. that enters a collecting system should be subject to appropriate treatment before being discharged into fresh water or estuaries, in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC. In that context, waste water from agglomerations of less than 2 000 p.e. should fall under the scope of this Regulation only when it enters a collecting system and is subject to treatment in an urban waste water treatment plant. Similarly, this Regulation should not concern biodegradable industrial waste water from plants belonging to the industrial sectors listed in Annex III to Directive 91/271/EEC, unless the waste water from those plants enters a collecting system and is subject to treatment in an urban waste water treatment plant.\n(21)\nThe reuse of treated urban waste water for agricultural irrigation is a market-driven action, based on the demands and needs of the agricultural sector, in particular in certain Member States that face water resource shortages. The reclamation facility operators and the end-users should cooperate to ensure that reclaimed water produced in accordance with the minimum quality requirements established by this Regulation meets the needs of the end-users regarding crop categories. In cases where the quality classes of the water produced by the reclamation facility operators are not compatible with the crop category and irrigation method already in place in the area served, for example in a collective supply system, water quality requirements could be met by using, at a subsequent stage, several water treatment options alone or in combination with non-treatment options for the reclaimed water, in line with the multi-barrier approach.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure optimal reuse of urban waste water resources, end-users should receive training to ensure that they use water of the appropriate reclaimed water quality class. Where the destination of a specific type of crop is unknown or where it has multiple destinations, reclaimed water of the highest quality class should be used, unless appropriate barriers are applied which enable the required quality to be achieved.\n(23)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the use of reclaimed water is safe, thereby encouraging water reuse at Union level and enhancing public confidence in it. Production and supply of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation should therefore only be permitted on the basis of a permit, granted by competent authorities of Member States. In order to ensure a harmonised approach at Union level, traceability of reclaimed water and transparency, the substantive rules for such permits should be laid down at Union level. However, the details of the procedures for granting permits, such as the designation of the competent authorities and deadlines, should be determined by Member States. Member States should be able to apply existing procedures for granting permits, which should be adapted to take account of the requirements introduced by this Regulation. When designating the parties responsible for the drawing up of the water reuse risk management plan and the competent authority for the granting of the permit for production and supply of reclaimed water, Member States should ensure that there is no conflict of interests.\n(24)\nIf a reclaimed water distribution operator and a reclaimed water storage operator are needed, it should be possible to require such operators to have a permit. If all requirements for the permit are met, the competent authority in the Member State should grant a permit containing all the necessary conditions and measures established in the water reuse risk management plan.\n(25)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, it should be possible for treatment operations and urban waste water reclamation operations to take place in the same physical location, using the same facility, or different, separate facilities. In addition, it should be possible for the same actor to be both treatment plant operator and reclamation facility operator.\n(26)\nCompetent authorities should verify compliance of reclaimed water with the conditions set out in the relevant permit. In cases of non-compliance, those authorities should require the responsible parties to take the necessary measures to ensure that the reclaimed water is in compliance. Supply of the reclaimed water should be suspended where non-compliance causes a significant risk to the environment or to human or animal health.\n(27)\nThe provisions of this Regulation are intended to be complementary to the requirements of other Union legislation, in particular with regard to possible health and environmental risks. In order to ensure a holistic approach to addressing possible risks to the environment and to human and animal health, the reclamation facility operators and competent authorities should take into account the requirements laid down in other relevant Union legislation, in particular Council Directives 86/278/EEC (8) and 91/676/EEC (9), Directives 91/271/EEC, 98/83/EC and 2000/60/EC, Regulations (EC) No 178/2002 (10), (EC) No 852/2004 (11), (EC) No 183/2005 (12), (EC) No 396/2005 (13) and (EC) No 1069/2009 (14) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 2006/7/EC (15), 2006/118/EC (16), 2008/105/EC (17) and 2011/92/EU (18) of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Commission Regulations (EC) No 2073/2005 (19), (EC) No 1881/2006 (20) and (EU) No 142/2011 (21).\n(28)\nRegulation (EC) No 852/2004 lays down general rules for food business operators and covers the production, processing, distribution and placing on the market of food intended for human consumption. That Regulation addresses the health quality of food and one of its main principles is that the primary responsibility for food safety is borne by the food business operator. That Regulation is also supported by detailed guidance. In this regard, the Commission notice on guidance document on addressing microbiological risks in fresh fruits and vegetables at primary production through good hygiene is of particular relevance. The minimum requirements for reclaimed water laid down in this Regulation do not preclude food business operators from obtaining the water quality required to comply with Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 using, at a subsequent stage, several water treatment options alone or in combination with non-treatment options.\n(29)\nThere is great potential for the recycling and reuse of treated waste water. With a view to promoting and encouraging water reuse, the indication of specific uses within this Regulation should not preclude Member States from allowing the use of reclaimed water for other purposes, including industrial, amenity-related and environmental purposes, as considered necessary in the light of national circumstances and needs, provided a high level of protection of the environment and of human and animal health is ensured.\n(30)\nCompetent authorities should cooperate with other relevant authorities, through the exchange of information, in order to ensure compliance with relevant Union and national requirements.\n(31)\nIn order to increase confidence in water reuse, information should be provided to the public. Making available clear, comprehensive and updated information on water reuse would allow for increased transparency and traceability and could also be of particular use to other relevant authorities for whom the specific water reuse has implications. In order to encourage water reuse and with a view to making stakeholders aware of the benefits of water reuse and thereby promoting acceptance, Member States should ensure that information and awareness-raising campaigns, adapted to the scale of water reuse, are developed.\n(32)\nEnd-user education and training are of primary importance as components of implementing and maintaining preventive measures. Specific human exposure preventive measures should be considered in the water reuse risk management plan, such as use of personal protective equipment, handwashing and personal hygiene.\n(33)\nDirective 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) aims to guarantee the right of access to environmental information in the Member States in line with the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters (23) (the Aarhus Convention). Directive 2003/4/EC lays down extensive obligations related both to making environmental information available upon request and actively disseminating such information. Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (24) covers the sharing of spatial information, including data sets on different environmental topics. It is important that provisions of this Regulation related to access to information and data-sharing arrangements complement those Directives and do not create a separate legal regime. Therefore, the provisions of this Regulation on information to the public and on information about monitoring of implementation should be without prejudice to Directives 2003/4/EC and 2007/2/EC.\n(34)\nData provided by Member States are essential to enable the Commission to monitor and assess this Regulation in relation to the objectives it pursues.\n(35)\nPursuant to paragraph 22 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (25), the Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation. The evaluation should be based on the five criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and Union value added and should provide the basis for impact assessments of possible further measures. The evaluation should take into account scientific progress, in particular as regards the potential impact of substances of emerging concern.\n(36)\nThe minimum requirements for the safe reuse of treated urban waste water reflect available scientific knowledge and internationally recognised water reuse standards and practices and guarantee that such water can be safely used for agricultural irrigation, thereby ensuring a high level of protection of the environment and of human and animal health. In light of the results of the evaluation of this Regulation or whenever new scientific developments and technical progress so require, the Commission should be able to examine the need to review the minimum requirements set out in Section 2 of Annex I and, where appropriate, should submit a legislative proposal to amend this Regulation.\n(37)\nIn order to adapt the key elements of risk management to technical and scientific progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to amend the key elements of risk management provided for in this Regulation. Moreover, in order to ensure a high level of protection of the environment and of human and animal health, the Commission should also be able to adopt delegated acts supplementing the key elements of risk management provided for in this Regulation by laying down technical specifications. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(38)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission for the adoption of detailed rules regarding the format and presentation of the information relating to monitoring of the implementation of this Regulation to be provided by the Member States and regarding the format and presentation of the Union-wide overview drawn up by the European Environment Agency. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26).\n(39)\nThe aim of this Regulation is, inter alia, to protect the environment and human and animal health. As the Court of Justice has held on numerous occasions, it would be incompatible with the binding effect which the third paragraph of Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ascribes to a Directive, to exclude, in principle, the possibility of an obligation imposed by a Directive from being relied on by persons concerned. That consideration also applies in respect of a Regulation which has as its objective to guarantee that reclaimed water is safe for agricultural irrigation.\n(40)\nMember States should lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and should take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(41)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the protection of the environment and of human and animal health, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(42)\nIt is necessary to provide for sufficient time for Member States to set up the administrative infrastructure necessary for the application of this Regulation as well as for operators to prepare for the application of the new rules.\n(43)\nWith a view to developing and promoting the reuse of properly treated waste water as much as possible and in order to bring about a significant improvement in the reliability of properly treated waste water and in viable use methods, the Union should support research and development in this area through the Horizon Europe programme.\n(44)\nThis Regulation seeks to encourage the sustainable use of water. With that aim in view, the Commission should undertake to use Union programmes, including the LIFE programme, to support local initiatives involving the reuse of properly treated waste water,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and purpose\n1.   This Regulation lays down minimum requirements for water quality and monitoring and provisions on risk management, for the safe use of reclaimed water in the context of integrated water management.\n2.   The purpose of this Regulation is to guarantee that reclaimed water is safe for agricultural irrigation, thereby ensuring a high level of protection of the environment and of human and animal health, promoting the circular economy, supporting adaptation to climate change, and contributing to the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC by addressing water scarcity and the resulting pressure on water resources, in a coordinated way throughout the Union, thus also contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation applies whenever treated urban waste water is reused, in accordance with Article 12(1) of Directive 91/271/EEC, for agricultural irrigation as specified in Section 1 of Annex I to this Regulation.\n2.   A Member State may decide that it is not appropriate to reuse water for agricultural irrigation in one or more of its river basin districts or parts thereof, taking into account the following criteria:\n(a)\nthe geographic and climatic conditions of the district or parts thereof;\n(b)\nthe pressures on and the status of other water resources, including the quantitative status of groundwater bodies as referred to in Directive 2000/60/EC;\n(c)\nthe pressures on and the status of the surface water bodies in which treated urban waste water is discharged;\n(d)\nthe environmental and resource costs of reclaimed water and of other water resources.\nAny decision taken pursuant to the first subparagraph shall be duly justified on the basis of the criteria referred to in that subparagraph and submitted to the Commission. It shall be reviewed as necessary, in particular taking into account climate change projections and national climate change adaptation strategies, and at least every six years taking into account river basin management plans established pursuant to Directive 2000/60/EC.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, research or pilot projects in relation to reclamation facilities may be exempted from this Regulation where the competent authority establishes that the following criteria are met:\n(a)\nthe research or pilot project will not be carried out within a water body used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption or a relevant safeguard zone designated pursuant to Directive 2000/60/EC;\n(b)\nthe research or pilot project will be subject to appropriate monitoring.\nAny exemption pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to a maximum period of five years.\nCrops resulting from a research or pilot project exempted pursuant to this paragraph shall not be placed on the market.\n4.   This Regulation applies without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 and does not preclude food business operators from obtaining the water quality required to comply with that Regulation by using, at a subsequent stage, several water treatment options alone or in combination with non-treatment options, or from using alternative water sources for agricultural irrigation.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘competent authority’ means an authority or a body designated by a Member State to carry out its obligations under this Regulation regarding the granting of permits for the production or supply of reclaimed water, regarding exemptions for research or pilot projects and regarding compliance checks;\n(2)\n‘end-user’ means a natural or legal person, whether a public or private entity, that uses reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation;\n(3)\n‘urban waste water’ means urban waste water as defined in point (1) of Article 2 of Directive 91/271/EEC;\n(4)\n‘reclaimed water’ means urban waste water that has been treated in compliance with the requirements set out in Directive 91/271/EEC and which results from further treatment in a reclamation facility in accordance with Section 2 of Annex I to this Regulation;\n(5)\n‘reclamation facility’ means an urban waste water treatment plant or other facility that further treats urban waste water that complies with the requirements set out in Directive 91/271/EEC in order to produce water that is fit for a use specified in Section 1 of Annex I to this Regulation;\n(6)\n‘reclamation facility operator’ means a natural or legal person, representing a private entity or a public authority, that operates or controls a reclamation facility;\n(7)\n‘hazard’ means a biological, chemical, physical or radiological agent that has the potential to cause harm to people, animals, crops or plants, other terrestrial biota, aquatic biota, soils or the environment in general;\n(8)\n‘risk’ means the likelihood of identified hazards causing harm in a specified timeframe, including the severity of the consequences;\n(9)\n‘risk management’ means systematic management that consistently ensures that water reuse is safe in a specific context;\n(10)\n‘preventive measure’ means an appropriate action or activity that can prevent or eliminate a health or environmental risk, or that can reduce such a risk to an acceptable level;\n(11)\n‘point of compliance’ means the point where a reclamation facility operator delivers reclaimed water to the next actor in the chain;\n(12)\n‘barrier’ is any means, including physical or process-related steps or conditions of use, that reduces or prevents a risk of human infection by preventing contact of reclaimed water with produce to be ingested and directly exposed persons, or other means that, for example, reduces the concentration of microorganisms in the reclaimed water or prevents their survival on the produce to be ingested;\n(13)\n‘permit’ means a written authorisation issued by a competent authority to produce or supply reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation in accordance with this Regulation;\n(14)\n‘responsible party’ means a party carrying out a role or activity in the water reuse system, including the reclamation facility operator, the urban waste water treatment plant operator where different from the reclamation facility operator, the relevant authority other than the designated competent authority, the reclaimed water distribution operator or the reclaimed water storage operator;\n(15)\n‘water reuse system’ means the infrastructure and other technical elements necessary for producing, supplying and using reclaimed water; it comprises all the elements from the entry point of the urban waste water treatment plant to the point where reclaimed water is used for agricultural irrigation, including distribution and storage infrastructure, where relevant.\nArticle 4\nObligations of the reclamation facility operator and obligations regarding reclaimed water quality\n1.   The reclamation facility operator shall ensure that, at the point of compliance, reclaimed water intended for agricultural irrigation as specified in Section 1 of Annex I complies with the following:\n(a)\nthe minimum requirements for water quality laid down in Section 2 of Annex I;\n(b)\nany additional conditions set by the competent authority in the relevant permit pursuant to points (c) and (d) of Article 6(3), as regards water quality.\nBeyond the point of compliance, the quality of the water shall no longer be the responsibility of the reclamation facility operator.\n2.   In order to ensure compliance in accordance with paragraph 1, the reclamation facility operator shall monitor water quality in accordance with the following:\n(a)\nSection 2 of Annex I;\n(b)\nany additional conditions set by the competent authority in the relevant permit pursuant to points (c) and (d) of Article 6(3), as regards monitoring.\nArticle 5\nRisk management\n1.

The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 13 amending this Regulation in order to adapt to technical and scientific progress the key elements of risk management set out in Annex II.\nThe Commission is also empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 13 supplementing this Regulation in order to lay down technical specifications of the key elements of risk management set out in Annex II.\nArticle 6\nReclaimed water permit obligations\n1.   The production and supply of reclaimed water intended for agricultural irrigation as specified in Section 1 of Annex I shall be subject to a permit.\n2.   The responsible parties in the water reuse system, including the end-user where relevant in accordance with national law, shall submit an application for a permit or for a modification of an existing permit to the competent authority of the Member State in which the reclamation facility operates or is planned to operate.\n3.   The permit shall set out the obligations of the reclamation facility operator and, where relevant, of any other responsible parties. The permit shall be based on the water reuse risk management plan and shall specify, inter alia, the following:\n(a)\nthe reclaimed water quality class or classes and the agricultural use for which, in accordance with Annex I, the reclaimed water is permitted, the place of use, the reclamation facilities and the estimated yearly volume of the reclaimed water to be produced;\n(b)\nconditions in relation to the minimum requirements for water quality and monitoring set out in Section 2 of Annex I;\n(c)\nany conditions in relation to additional requirements for the reclamation facility operator, set out in the water reuse risk management plan;\n(d)\nany other conditions necessary to eliminate any unacceptable risks to the environment and to human and animal health so that any risks are of an acceptable level;\n(e)\nthe validity period of the permit;\n(f)\nthe point of compliance.\n4.   For the purpose of assessing an application, the competent authority shall consult and exchange relevant information with other relevant authorities, in particular the water and health authorities if different from the competent authority, and any other party which the competent authority considers relevant.\n5.   The competent authority shall decide without delay whether to grant a permit. Where, due to the complexity of an application, the competent authority needs more than 12 months from the receipt of a complete application to decide whether to grant a permit, it shall communicate the expected date of its decision to the applicant.\n6.   Permits shall be regularly reconsidered, and shall be updated where necessary, at least in the following cases:\n(a)\nthere has been a substantial change in capacity;\n(b)\nequipment has been upgraded;\n(c)\nnew equipment or processes have been added; or\n(d)\nthere have been changes in climatic or other conditions which significantly affect the ecological status of surface water bodies.\n7.

irrigation\nAgricultural irrigation means irrigation of the following types of crops:\n—\nfood crops consumed raw, meaning crops which are intended for human consumption in a raw or unprocessed state;\n—\nprocessed food crops, meaning crops which are intended for human consumption after a treatment process (i.e. cooked or industrially processed);\n—\nnon-food crops, meaning crops which are not intended for human consumption (e.g. pastures and forage, fibre, ornamental, seed, energy and turf crops).\nWithout prejudice to other relevant Union law in the fields of the environment and of health, Member States may use reclaimed water for further uses such as:\n—\nindustrial water reuse; and\n—\namenity-related and environmental purposes.\nSection 2\nMinimum requirements\nMinimum requirements applicable to reclaimed water intended for agricultural irrigation\nThe reclaimed water quality classes and the permitted uses and irrigation methods for each class are set out in Table 1. The minimum requirements for water quality are set out in Table 2 of point (a). The minimum frequencies and performance targets for monitoring reclaimed water are set out in Table 3 (routine monitoring) and Table 4 (validation monitoring) of point (b).\nCrops belonging to a given category shall be irrigated with reclaimed water of the corresponding minimum reclaimed water quality class as set out in Table 1, unless appropriate additional barriers as referred to in point (c) of Article 5(4) are used, which result in achieving the quality requirements set out in Table 2 of point (a). Such additional barriers may be based on the indicative list of preventive measures referred to in point 7 of Annex II or in any other equivalent national or international standards, e.g. the standard ISO 16075-2.\nTable 1 – Classes of reclaimed water quality and permitted agricultural use and irrigation method\nMinimum reclaimed water quality class\nCrop category (*1)\nIrrigation method\nA\nAll food crops consumed raw where the edible part is in direct contact with reclaimed water and root crops consumed raw\nAll irrigation methods\nB\nFood crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water, processed food crops and non-food crops including crops used to feed milk- or meat-producing animals\nAll irrigation methods\nC\nFood crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water, processed food crops and non-food crops including crops used to feed milk- or meat-producing animals\nDrip irrigation (*2) or other irrigation method that avoids direct contact with the edible part of the crop\nD\nIndustrial, energy and seeded crops\nAll irrigation methods (*3)\n(a)   Minimum requirements for water quality\nTable 2 – Reclaimed water quality requirements for agricultural irrigation\nReclaimed water quality class\nIndicative technology target\nQuality requirements\nE. coli\n(number/100 ml)\nBOD5\n(mg/l)\nTSS\n(mg/l)\nTurbidity\n(NTU)\nOther\nA\nSecondary treatment, filtration, and disinfection\n≤ 10\n≤ 10\n≤ 10\n≤ 5\nLegionella spp.: < 1 000  cfu/l where there is a risk of aerosolisation\nIntestinal nematodes (helminth eggs): ≤ 1 egg/l for irrigation of pastures or forage\nB\nSecondary treatment, and disinfection\n≤ 100\nIn accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC\n(Annex I, Table 1)\nIn accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC\n(Annex I, Table 1)\n-\nC\nSecondary treatment, and disinfection\n≤ 1 000\n-\nD\nSecondary treatment, and disinfection\n≤ 10 000\n-\nReclaimed water shall be considered to be in compliance with the requirements set out in Table 2 where the measurements for that reclaimed water meet all of the following criteria:\n—\nthe indicated values for E. coli, Legionella spp. and intestinal nematodes are met in 90 % or more of the samples; none of the values of the samples exceed the maximum deviation limit of 1 log unit from the indicated value for E. coli and Legionella spp. and 100 % of the indicated value for intestinal nematodes;\n—\nthe indicated values for BOD5, TSS, and turbidity in Class A are met in 90 % or more of the samples; none of the values of the samples exceed the maximum deviation limit of 100 % of the indicated value.\n(b)   Minimum requirements for monitoring\nReclamation facility operators shall perform routine monitoring to verify that the reclaimed water is in compliance with the minimum water quality requirements set out in point (a). The routine monitoring shall be included in the verification procedures of the water reuse system.\nThe samples to be used to verify compliance with the microbiological parameters at the point of compliance shall be taken in accordance with standard EN ISO 19458 or with any other national or international standards that ensure equivalent quality.\nTable 3 – Minimum frequencies for routine monitoring of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation\nMinimum monitoring frequencies\nReclaimed water quality class\nE. coli\nBOD5\nTSS\nTurbidity\nLegionella spp.\n(when applicable)\nIntestinal nematodes\n(when applicable)\nA\nOnce a week\nOnce a week\nOnce a week\nContinuous\nTwice a month\nTwice a month or as determined by the reclamation facility operator according to the number of eggs in waste water entering the reclamation facility\nB\nOnce a week\nIn accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC\n(Annex I, Section D)\nIn accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC\n(Annex I, Section D)\n-\nC\nTwice a month\n-\nD\nTwice a month\n-\nValidation monitoring shall be performed before a new reclamation facility is put into operation.\nReclamation facilities that are already in operation and that meet the reclaimed water quality requirements set out in Table 2 of point (a) on 25 June 2020 shall be exempted from that validation monitoring obligation.\nHowever, validation monitoring shall be performed in all cases where equipment is upgraded, and when new equipment or processes are added.\nValidation monitoring shall be performed for the reclaimed water quality class with the most stringent requirements, Class A, to assess whether the performance targets (log10 reduction) are complied with. Validation monitoring shall entail the monitoring of the indicator microorganisms associated with each group of pathogens, namely bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The indicator microorganisms selected are E. coli for pathogenic bacteria, F-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages or coliphages for pathogenic viruses, and Clostridium perfringens spores or spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria for protozoa. Performance targets (log10 reduction) for the validation monitoring for the selected indicator microorganisms are set out in Table 4 and shall be met at the point of compliance, considering the concentrations of the raw waste water entering the urban waste water treatment plant. At least 90 % of validation samples shall reach or exceed the performance targets.\nIf a biological indicator is not present in sufficient quantity in raw waste water to achieve the log10 reduction, the absence of such biological indicator in reclaimed water shall mean that the validation requirements are complied with. The compliance with the performance target may be established by analytical control, by addition of the performance granted to individual treatment steps based on scientific evidence for standard well-established processes, such as published data of testing reports or case studies, or tested in a laboratory under controlled conditions for innovative treatment.\nTable 4 – Validation monitoring of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation\nReclaimed water quality class\nIndicator microorganisms (*4)\nPerformance targets for the treatment chain\n(log10 reduction)\nA\nE. coli\n≥ 5,0\nTotal coliphages/F-specific coliphages/somatic coliphages/coliphages (*5)\n≥ 6,0\nClostridium perfringens spores/spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria (*6)\n≥ 4,0 (in case of Clostridium perfringens spores)\n≥ 5,0 (in case of spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria)\nMethods of analysis for monitoring shall be validated and documented in accordance with EN ISO/IEC-17025 or other national or international standards that ensure an equivalent quality.\n(*1)  If the same type of irrigated crop falls under multiple categories of Table 1, the requirements of the most stringent category shall apply.\n(*2)  Drip irrigation (also called trickle irrigation) is a micro-irrigation system capable of delivering water drops or tiny streams to the plants and involves dripping water onto the soil or directly under its surface at very low rates (2–20 litres/hour) from a system of small-diameter plastic pipes fitted with outlets called emitters or drippers.\n(*3)  In the case of irrigation methods which imitate rain, special attention should be paid to the protection of the health of workers or bystanders. For this purpose, appropriate preventive measures shall be applied.\n(*4)  The reference pathogens Campylobacter, Rotavirus and Cryptosporidium may also be used for validation monitoring purposes instead of the proposed indicator microorganisms. The following log10 reduction performance targets shall then apply: Campylobacter (≥ 5,0), Rotavirus (≥ 6,0) and Cryptosporidium (≥ 5,0).\n(*5)  Total coliphages is selected as the most appropriate viral indicator. However, if analysis of total coliphages is not feasible, at least one of them (F-specific or somatic coliphages) shall be analysed.\n(*6)  Clostridium perfringens spores is selected as the most appropriate protozoa indicator. However, spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria are an alternative if the concentration of Clostridium perfringens spores does not make it possible to validate the requested log10 removal.\nANNEX II\n(A)\nKey elements of risk management\nRisk management shall comprise identifying and managing risks in a proactive way to ensure that reclaimed water is safely used and managed and that there is no risk to the environment or to human or animal health. For those purposes, a water reuse risk management plan shall be established on the basis of the following elements:\n1.\nDescription of the entire water reuse system, from the entry of waste water into the urban waste water treatment plant to the point of use, including the sources of waste water, the treatment steps and the technologies used at the reclamation facility, the supply, distribution and storage infrastructure, the intended use, the place and period of use (e.g. temporary or ad-hoc use), the irrigation method, the crop type, other water sources if a mix is intended to be used and the volume of reclaimed water to be supplied.\n2.\nIdentification of all parties involved in the water reuse system and a clear description of their roles and responsibilities.\n3.\nIdentification of potential hazards, in particular the presence of pollutants and pathogens, and the potential for hazardous events such as treatment failures or accidental leakages or contamination of the water reuse system.\n4.\nIdentification of the environments and populations at risk, and the exposure routes to the identified potential hazards, taking into account specific environmental factors, such as local hydrogeology, topology, soil type and ecology, and factors related to the type of crops and farming and irrigation practices.

and\nthe 2015 EU action plan for the Circular Economy which committed to a series of actions to promote the use of treated waste water and to a legal proposal setting out minimum requirements for water reuse.\nScope\nThe regulation applies whenever treated urban waste water is reused, according to Article 12(1) of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste water, for agricultural irrigation (see summary).\nAn EU country can decide that it is not appropriate to reuse water for agricultural irrigation in one or more of its river basin districts or parts thereof, on the basis of specific criteria: the geographic and climatic conditions of the district or parts thereof;the pressures on and the status of other water resources;the pressures on and the status of the surface water bodies in which treated urban waste water is discharged;the environmental and resource costs of reclaimed water and of other water resources.\nSuch decision must be duly justified and regularly reviewed to take into account changing circumstances, such as climate change projections and national climate change adaptation strategies, as well as the river basins management plans drawn up in accordance with the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC — see summary).\nThe regulation allows for time-limited exemptions from the rules for research or pilot projects, subject to certain conditions.\nReclaimed water quality\nThe reclamation facility operator must ensure that reclaimed water intended for agricultural irrigation complies with:\nthe minimum requirements for water quality set out in the annex 1 of the regulation — covering microbiological elements (such as levels of E. coli bacteria) and monitoring requirements for routine and validation monitoring;\nany additional conditions concerning water quality set by the competent authority in the relevant permit issued.\nRisk management\nThe relevant national authority must ensure that a water reuse risk management plan to produce, supply and use reclaimed water is drawn up.\nThe water reuse risk management plan can be drafted by the reclamation facility operator, other parties in the water reuse project or the end users, as appropriate, and it must identify the risk management responsibilities of all parties in the water reuse project.\nIt must, in particular, set out any additional water quality requirements, identify appropriate preventive and/or corrective measures and any additional barriers or measures to ensure the safety of the system.\nPermit obligations\nThe production and supply of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation requires a permit.\nParties concerned must submit an application to the relevant national authority.\nThe permits sets out the obligations for the reclamation facility operator, and, where relevant, of other parties involved in the water reuse system, which are based on the risk management plan. They must specify a number of elements including: the reclaimed water quality class or classes and the agricultural use for which the reclaimed water is permitted, the place of use, the reclamation facilities and the estimated yearly volume of the reclaimed water to be produced;conditions in relation to the minimum requirements for water quality and monitoring;conditions in relation to additional requirements for the reclamation facility operator, set out in the water reuse risk management plan;any other conditions necessary to eliminate any unacceptable risks to the environment and to human and animal health so that any risks are of an acceptable level;the validity period of the permit;the point of compliance.\nPermits must be regularly reviewed and updated where necessary, and at least in the case of significant changes in the treatment processes or in the site conditions.\nCompliance checks\nThe competent national authority must check compliance with the conditions set out in the permit. These can be carried out by: on-the-spot checks;monitoring data obtained, in particular pursuant to this regulation;any other adequate means.\nThe regulation also sets out the measures to be taken in case of non-compliance.\nThe competent national authority must also regularly check compliance with risk management plans.\nTransparency and information sharing\nNational contact points must be established to facilitate cross-border coordination where necessary.\nTo ensure transparency, the regulation also sets out rules on: awareness raising;information to be provided to the public;information on the monitoring of implementation.\nThe Commission will carry out an evaluation of the regulation by 26 June 2028.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 26 June 2023.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nWater reuse (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2020/741 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 2020 on minimum requirements for water reuse (OJ L 177, 5.6.2020, pp. 32-55)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — Closing the loop — An EU action plan for the Circular Economy (COM(2015) 614 final, 2.12.2015)\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — A Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources (COM(2012) 673 final, 14.11.2012)\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council — Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union (COM(2007) 414 final, 18.7.2007)\nRegulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, pp. 1-54).
