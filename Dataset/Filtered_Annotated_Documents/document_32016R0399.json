{"celex_id": "32016R0399", "reference": "23.3.2016\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 77/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2016/399 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 9 March 2016\non a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)\n(codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 77(2)(b) and (e) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nThe adoption of measures under Article 77(2)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), with a view to ensuring the absence of any controls on persons crossing internal borders, forms part of the Union’s objective of establishing an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of persons is ensured, as set out in Article 26(2) TFEU.\n(3)\nIn accordance with Article 67(2) TFEU, the creation of an area in which persons may move freely is to be flanked by other measures. The common policy on the crossing of external borders, as provided for by Article 77(1)(b) TFEU, is such a measure.\n(4)\nCommon measures on the crossing of internal borders by persons and border control at external borders should reflect the Schengen acquis incorporated in the Union framework, and in particular the relevant provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (4) and the Common Manual (5).\n(5)\nCommon rules on the movement of persons across borders neither call into question nor affect the rights of free movement enjoyed by Union citizens and members of their families and by third-country nationals and members of their families who, under agreements between the Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and those third countries, on the other hand, enjoy rights of free movement equivalent to those of Union citizens.\n(6)\nBorder control is in the interest not only of the Member State at whose external borders it is carried out but of all Member States which have abolished internal border control. Border control should help to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and to prevent any threat to the Member States’ internal security, public policy, public health and international relations.\n(7)\nBorder checks should be carried out in such a way as to fully respect human dignity. Border control should be carried out in a professional and respectful manner and be proportionate to the objectives pursued.\n(8)\nBorder control comprises not only checks on persons at border crossing points and surveillance between those border crossing points, but also an analysis of the risks for internal security and of the threats that may affect the security of external borders. It is therefore necessary to set out the conditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at border crossing points and surveillance at the border, including checks in the Schengen Information System (SIS).\n(9)\nIt is necessary to provide for rules dealing with the calculation of the authorised length of short-term stays in the Union. Clear, simple and harmonised rules in all legal acts dealing with this issue would benefit both travellers as well as border and visa authorities.\n(10)\nSince only a verification of fingerprints can confirm with certainty that a person wishing to enter the Schengen area is the person to whom the visa has been issued, provision should be made for the use at external borders of the Visa Information System (VIS) provided for under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(11)\nIn order to verify whether the entry conditions for third-country nationals laid down in this Regulation are fulfilled and to manage their tasks successfully, border guards should use all necessary information available, including data which may be consulted in the VIS.\n(12)\nIn order to prevent circumvention of border crossing points where the VIS may be used and to guarantee its full effectiveness, there is a particular need to use the VIS in a harmonised way when entry checks are carried out at the external borders.\n(13)\nSince in cases of repeated visa applications it is appropriate for biometric data to be reused and copied from the first visa application in the VIS, use of the VIS for entry checks at the external borders should be compulsory.\n(14)\nThe use of the VIS should entail a systematic search in the VIS using the number of the visa sticker in combination with a verification of fingerprints. However, given the potential impact of such searches on waiting times at border crossing points, it should be possible, for a transitional period by way of derogation and in strictly defined circumstances, to consult the VIS without a systematic verification of fingerprints. Member States should ensure that this derogation is used only where the conditions therefor are fully met and that the duration and frequency of application of this derogation is kept to a strict minimum at the individual border crossing points.\n(15)\nIt should be possible to have checks at external borders relaxed in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances in order to avoid excessive waiting time at border crossing points. The systematic stamping of the documents of third-country nationals remains an obligation in the event of border checks being relaxed. Stamping makes it possible to establish, with certainty, the date on which, and where, the border was crossed, without establishing in all cases that all required travel document control measures have been carried out.\n(16)\nIn order to reduce the waiting times of persons enjoying the Union right of free movement, separate lanes, indicated by uniform signs in all Member States, should, where circumstances allow, be provided at border crossing points. Separate lanes should be provided in international airports. Where it is deemed appropriate and if local circumstances so allow, Member States should consider installing separate lanes at sea and land border crossing points.\n(17)\nMember States should ensure that control procedures at external borders do not constitute a major barrier to trade and social and cultural interchange. To that end, they should deploy appropriate numbers of staff and resources.\n(18)\nMember States should designate the national service or services responsible for border-control tasks in accordance with their national law. Where more than one service is responsible in the same Member State, there should be close and constant cooperation between them.\n(19)\nOperational cooperation and assistance between Member States in relation to border control should be managed and coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States (‘the Agency’), established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 (7).\n(20)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to checks carried out under general police powers and security checks on persons identical to those carried out for domestic flights, to the possibilities for Member States to carry out exceptional checks on baggage in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 3925/91 (8), and to national law on carrying travel or identity documents or to the requirement that persons notify the authorities of their presence on the territory of the Member State in question.\n(21)\nIn an area where persons may move freely, the reintroduction of border control at internal borders should remain an exception. Border control should not be carried out or formalities imposed solely because such a border is crossed.\n(22)\nThe creation of an area in which the free movement of persons across internal borders is ensured is one of the main achievements of the Union. In an area without internal border control, it is necessary to have a common response to situations seriously affecting the public policy or internal security of that area, of parts thereof, or of one or more Member States, by allowing for the temporary reintroduction of internal border control in exceptional circumstances, but without jeopardising the principle of the free movement of persons. Given the impact that such measures of last resort may have on all persons having the right to move within the area without internal border control, the conditions and procedures for reintroducing such measures should be provided for, in order to ensure that they are exceptional and that the principle of proportionality is respected. The scope and duration of any temporary reintroduction of such measures should be restricted to the bare minimum needed to respond to a serious threat to public policy or internal security.\n(23)\nAs free movement of persons is affected by the temporary reintroduction of internal border control, any decision to reintroduce such control should be taken in accordance with commonly agreed criteria and should be duly notified to the Commission or be recommended by a Union institution. In any case, the reintroduction of internal border control should remain an exception and should only be effected as a measure of last resort, for a strictly limited scope and period of time, based on specific objective criteria and on an assessment of its necessity which should be monitored at Union level. Where a serious threat to public policy or internal security requires immediate action, a Member State should be able to reintroduce border control at its internal borders for a period not exceeding ten days. Any prolongation of that period needs to be monitored at Union level.\n(24)\nThe necessity and proportionality of reintroducing internal border control should be balanced against the threat to public policy or internal security triggering the need for such reintroduction, as should alternative measures which could be taken at national or Union level, or both, and the impact of such control on the free movement of persons within the area without internal border control.\n(25)\nThe reintroduction of internal border control might exceptionally be necessary in the case of a serious threat to public policy or to internal security at the level of the area without internal border control or at national level, in particular following terrorist incidents or threats, or because of threats posed by organised crime.\n(26)\nMigration and the crossing of external borders by a large number of third-country nationals should not, per se, be considered to be a threat to public policy or internal security.\n(27)\nIn accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, a derogation from the fundamental principle of free movement of persons must be interpreted strictly and the concept of public policy presupposes the existence of a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.\n(28)\nBased on the experience gathered with respect to the functioning of the area without internal border control and in order to help ensure the consistent implementation of the Schengen acquis, the Commission may draw up guidelines on the reintroduction of internal border control in cases which require such a measure on a temporary basis and in cases where immediate action is needed. Those guidelines should provide clear indicators to facilitate the assessment of the circumstances that could constitute serious threats to public policy or internal security.\n(29)\nWhere serious deficiencies in the carrying out of external border control are identified in an evaluation report drawn up pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 (9) and with a view to ensuring compliance with the recommendations adopted pursuant to that Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to recommend that the evaluated Member State take specific measures, such as deploying European border guard teams, submitting strategic plans or, as a last resort and taking into account the seriousness of the situation, closing a specific border crossing-point. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). In the light of Article 2(2)(b)(iii) of that Regulation, the examination procedure is applicable.\n(30)\nThe temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders under a specific Union-level procedure could also be justified in the case of exceptional circumstances and as a measure of last resort where the overall functioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control identified in the context of a rigorous evaluation process in accordance with Articles 14 and 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013, where those circumstances would constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security in that area or in parts thereof. Such a specific procedure for the temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders could also be triggered, under the same conditions, as a result of the serious negligence by the evaluated Member State of its obligations. In view of the politically sensitive nature of such measures which touch on national executive and enforcement powers regarding internal border control, implementing powers to adopt recommendations under that specific Union-level procedure should be conferred on the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission.\n(31)\nBefore any recommendation on the temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders is adopted, the possibility of resorting to measures aiming to address the underlying situation, including assistance by Union bodies, offices or agencies, such as the Agency or the European Police Office (‘Europol’), established by Council Decision 2009/371/JHA (11), and technical or financial support measures at national level, Union level, or both, should be fully explored in a timely manner. Where a serious deficiency is detected, the Commission may provide financial support measures to help the Member State concerned. Moreover, any Commission and Council recommendation should be based on substantiated information.\n(32)\nThe Commission should have the possibility to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the need to prolong border control at internal borders, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(33)\nThe evaluation reports and the recommendations referred to in Articles 14 and 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 should form the basis for the triggering of the specific measures in the case of serious deficiencies relating to external border control and of the specific procedure in case of exceptional circumstances putting the overall functioning of the area without internal border control at risk provided for in this Regulation. The Member States and the Commission jointly conduct regular, objective and impartial evaluations in order to verify the correct application of this Regulation and the Commission coordinates the evaluations in close cooperation with the Member States. The evaluation mechanism consists of the following elements: multiannual and annual evaluation programmes, announced and unannounced on-site visits carried out by a small team of Commission representatives and of experts designated by Member States, reports on the outcome of the evaluations adopted by the Commission and recommendations for remedial action adopted by the Council on a proposal from the Commission, appropriate follow-up, monitoring and reporting.\n(34)\nSince the objective of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 and its successive amendments, namely the establishment of rules applicable to the movement of persons across borders, could not be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but could rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union was able to adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, that Regulation and its successive amendments did not go beyond what was necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(35)\nThe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of additional measures governing surveillance as well as amendments to the Annexes to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(36)\nThis Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It should be applied in accordance with the Member States’ obligations as regards international protection and non-refoulement.\n(37)\nBy way of derogation from Article 355 TFEU, the only territories of France and the Netherlands to which this Regulation applies are those in Europe. It does not affect the specific arrangements applied in Ceuta and Melilla, as defined in the Agreement on the Accession of the Kingdom of Spain to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 (12).\n(38)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the Position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(39)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters’ association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (13) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (14).\n(40)\nAs regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (15) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC (16).\n(41)\nAs regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (17) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2011/350/EU (18).\n(42)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC (19); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(43)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC (20); Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(44)\nAs regards Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania, the first paragraph of Article 1, Article 6(5)(a), Title III, and the provisions of Title II and the annexes thereto referring to the SIS and to the VIS constitute provisions building upon, or otherwise related to, the Schengen acquis within, respectively, the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession, Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2011 Act of Accession,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and principles\nThis Regulation provides

In accordance with the general principles of Union law, decisions under this Regulation shall be taken on an individual basis.\nTITLE II\nEXTERNAL BORDERS\nCHAPTER I\nCrossing of external borders and conditions for entry\nArticle 5\nCrossing of external borders\n1.   External borders may be crossed only at border crossing points and during the fixed opening hours. The opening hours shall be clearly indicated at border crossing points which are not open 24 hours a day.\nMember States shall notify the list of their border crossing points to the Commission in accordance with Article 39.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, exceptions to the obligation to cross external borders only at border crossing points and during fixed opening hours may be allowed:\n(a)\nfor individuals or groups of persons, where there is a requirement of a special nature for the occasional crossing of external borders outside border crossing points or outside fixed opening hours, provided that they are in possession of the permits required by national law and that there is no conflict with the interests of public policy and the internal security of the Member States. Member States may make specific arrangements in bilateral agreements. General exceptions provided for by national law and bilateral agreements shall be notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 39;\n(b)\nfor individuals or groups of persons in the event of an unforeseen emergency situation;\n(c)\nin accordance with the specific rules set out in Articles 19 and 20 in conjunction with Annexes VI and VII.\n3.   Without prejudice to the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 or to their international protection obligations, Member States shall introduce penalties, in accordance with their national law, for the unauthorised crossing of external borders at places other than border crossing points or at times other than the fixed opening hours. Those penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\nArticle 6\nEntry conditions for third-country nationals\n1.   For intended stays on the territory of the Member States of a duration of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period, which entails considering the 180-day period preceding each day of stay, the entry conditions for third-country nationals shall be the following:\n(a)\nthey are in possession of a valid travel document entitling the holder to cross the border satisfying the following criteria:\n(i)\nits validity shall extend at least three months after the intended date of departure from the territory of the Member States. In a justified case of emergency, this obligation may be waived;\n(ii)\nit shall have been issued within the previous 10 years;\n(b)\nthey are in possession of a valid visa, if required pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (25), except where they hold a valid residence permit or a valid long-stay visa;\n(c)\nthey justify the purpose and conditions of the intended stay, and they have sufficient means of subsistence, both for the duration of the intended stay and for the return to their country of origin or transit to a third country into which they are certain to be admitted, or are in a position to acquire such means lawfully;\n(d)\nthey are not persons for whom an alert has been issued in the SIS for the purposes of refusing entry;\n(e)\nthey are not considered to be a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Member States, in particular where no alert has been issued in Member States’ national data bases for the purposes of refusing entry on the same grounds.\n2.   For the purposes of implementing paragraph 1, the date of entry shall be considered as the first day of stay on the territory of the Member States and the date of exit shall be considered as the last day of stay on the territory of the Member States. Periods of stay authorised under a residence permit or a long-stay visa shall not be taken into account in the calculation of the duration of stay on the territory of the Member States.\n3.   A non-exhaustive list of supporting documents which the border guard may request from the third-country national in order to verify the fulfilment of the conditions set out in paragraph 1 (c) is included in Annex I.\n4.   Means of subsistence shall be assessed in accordance with the duration and the purpose of the stay and by reference to average prices in the Member State(s) concerned for board and lodging in budget accommodation, multiplied by the number of days stayed.\nReference amounts set by the Member States shall be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 39.\nThe assessment of sufficient means of subsistence may be based on the cash, travellers’ cheques and credit cards in the third-country national’s possession. Declarations of sponsorship, where such declarations are provided for by national law and letters of guarantee from hosts, as defined by national law, where the third-country national is staying with a host, may also constitute evidence of sufficient means of subsistence.\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1:\n(a)\nthird-country nationals who do not fulfil all the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 but who hold a residence permit or a long-stay visa shall be authorised to enter the territory of the other Member States for transit purposes so that they may reach the territory of the Member State which issued the residence permit or the long-stay visa, unless their names are on the national list of alerts of the Member State whose external borders they are seeking to cross and the alert is accompanied by instructions to refuse entry or transit;\n(b)\nthird-country nationals who fulfil the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, except for that laid down in point (b), and who present themselves at the border may be authorised to enter the territory of the Member States, if a visa is issued at the border in accordance with Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26).\nMember States shall compile statistics on visas issued at the border in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 and Annex XII thereto.\nIf it is not possible to affix a visa in the document, it shall, exceptionally, be affixed on a separate sheet inserted in the document. In such a case, the uniform format for forms for affixing the visa, laid down by Council Regulation (EC) No 333/2002 (27), shall be used;\n(c)\nthird-country nationals who do not fulfil one or more of the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 may be authorised by a Member State to enter its territory on humanitarian grounds, on grounds of national interest or because of international obligations. Where the third-country national concerned is the subject of an alert as referred to in paragraph 1(d), the Member State authorising him or her to enter its territory shall inform the other Member States accordingly.\nCHAPTER II\nControl of external borders and refusal of entry\nArticle 7\nConduct of border checks\n1.   Border guards shall, in the performance of their duties, fully respect human dignity, in particular in cases involving vulnerable persons.\nAny measures taken in the performance of their duties shall be proportionate to the objectives pursued by such measures.\n2.   While carrying out border checks, border guards shall not discriminate against persons on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.\nArticle 8\nBorder checks on persons\n1.   Cross-border movement at external borders shall be subject to checks by border guards. Checks shall be carried out in accordance with this chapter.\nThe checks may also cover the means of transport and objects in the possession of the persons crossing the border. The law of the Member State concerned shall apply to any searches which are carried out.\n2.   All persons shall undergo a minimum check in order to establish their identities on the basis of the production or presentation of their travel documents. Such a minimum check shall consist of a rapid and straightforward verification, where appropriate by using technical devices and by consulting, in the relevant databases, information exclusively on stolen, misappropriated, lost and invalidated documents, of the validity of the document authorising the legitimate holder to cross the border and of the presence of signs of falsification or counterfeiting.\nThe minimum check referred to in the first subparagraph shall be the rule for persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law.\nHowever, on a non-systematic basis, when carrying out minimum checks on persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law, border guards may consult national and European databases in order to ensure that such persons do not represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the internal security, public policy, international relations of the Member States or a threat to the public health.\nThe consequences of such consultations shall not jeopardise the right of entry of persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law into the territory of the Member State concerned as laid down in Directive 2004/38/EC.\n3.   On entry and exit, third-country nationals shall be subject to thorough checks as follows:\n(a)\nthorough checks on entry shall comprise verification of the conditions governing entry laid down in Article 6(1) and, where applicable, of documents authorising residence and the pursuit of a professional activity. This shall include a detailed examination covering the following aspects:\n(i)\nverification that the third-country national is in possession of a document which is valid for crossing the border and which has not expired, and that the document is accompanied, where applicable, by the requisite visa or residence permit;\n(ii)\nthorough scrutiny of the travel document for signs of falsification or counterfeiting;\n(iii)\nexamination of the entry and exit stamps on the travel document of the third-country national concerned, in order to verify, by comparing the dates of entry and exit, that the person has not already exceeded the maximum duration of authorised stay in the territory of the Member States;\n(iv)\nverification regarding the point of departure and the destination of the third-country national concerned and the purpose of the intended stay, checking, if necessary, the corresponding supporting documents;\n(v)\nverification that the third-country national concerned has sufficient means of subsistence for the duration and purpose of the intended stay, for his or her return to the country of origin or transit to a third country into which he or she is certain to be admitted, or that he or she is in a position to acquire such means lawfully;\n(vi)\nverification that the third-country national concerned, his or her means of transport and the objects he or she is transporting are not likely to jeopardise the public policy, internal security, public health or international relations of any of the Member States. Such verification shall include direct consultation of the data and alerts on persons and, where necessary, objects included in the SIS and in national data files and the action to be performed, if any, as a result of an alert;\n(b)\nif the third country national holds a visa referred to in Article 6(1)(b), the thorough checks on entry shall also comprise verification of the identity of the holder of the visa and of the authenticity of the visa, by consulting the Visa Information System (VIS) in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008;\n(c)\nby way of derogation, the VIS may be consulted using the number of the visa sticker in all cases and, on a random basis, the number of the visa sticker in combination with the verification of fingerprints where:\n(i)\ntraffic of such intensity arises that the waiting time at the border crossing point becomes excessive;\n(ii)\nall resources have already been exhausted as regards staff, facilities and organisation; and\n(iii)\non the basis of an assessment there is no risk related to internal security and illegal immigration.\nHowever, in all cases where there is doubt as to the identity of the holder of the visa and/or the authenticity of the visa, the VIS shall be consulted systematically using the number of the visa sticker in combination with the verification of fingerprints.\nThis derogation may be applied only at the border crossing point concerned for as long as the conditions referred to in points (i), (ii) and (iii) are met;\n(d)\nthe decision to consult the VIS in accordance with point (c) shall be taken by the border guard in command at the border crossing point or at a higher level.\nThe Member State concerned shall immediately notify the other Member States and the Commission of any such decision;\n(e)\neach Member State shall transmit once a year a report on the application of point (c) to the European Parliament and the Commission, which shall include the number of third-country nationals who were checked in the VIS using the number of the visa sticker only and the length of the waiting time referred to in point (c)(i);\n(f)\npoints (c) and (d) shall apply for a maximum period of three years, beginning three years after the VIS has started operations. The Commission shall, before the end of the second year of application of points (c) and (d), transmit to the European Parliament and to the Council an evaluation of their implementation. On the basis of that evaluation, the European Parliament or the Council may invite the Commission to propose appropriate amendments to this Regulation;\n(g)\nthorough checks on exit shall comprise:\n(i)\nverification that the third-country national is in possession of a document valid for crossing the border;\n(ii)\nverification of the travel document for signs of falsification or counterfeiting;\n(iii)\nwhenever possible, verification that the third-country national is not considered to be a threat to public policy, internal security or the international relations of any of the Member States;\n(h)\nin addition to the checks referred to in point (g) thorough checks on exit may also comprise:\n(i)\nverification that the person is in possession of a valid visa, if required pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, except where he or she holds a valid residence permit; such verification may comprise consultation of the VIS in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008;\n(ii)\nverification that the person did not exceed the maximum duration of authorised stay in the territory of the Member States;\n(iii)\nconsultation of alerts on persons and objects included in the SIS and reports in national data files;\n(i)\nfor the purpose of identification of any person who may not fulfil, or who may no longer fulfil, the conditions for entry, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States, the VIS may be consulted in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008.\n4.   Where facilities exist and if requested by the third-country national, such thorough checks shall be carried out in a private area.\n5.   Without prejudice to the second subparagraph, third-country nationals subject to a thorough second line check shall be given written information in a language which they understand or may reasonably be presumed to understand, or in another effective way, on the purpose of, and the procedure for, such a check.\nThis information shall be available in all the official languages of the Union and in the language(s) of the country or countries bordering the Member State concerned and shall indicate that the third-country national may request the name or service identification number of the border guards carrying out the thorough second line check, the name of the border crossing point and the date on which the border was crossed.\n6.   Checks on a person enjoying the right of free movement under Union law shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC.\n7.   Detailed rules governing the information to be registered are laid down in Annex II.\n8.   Where Article 5(2)(a) or (b) applies, Member States may also provide derogations from the rules set out in this Article.\nArticle 9\nRelaxation of border checks\n1.   Border checks at external borders may be relaxed as a result of exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. Such exceptional and unforeseen circumstances shall be deemed to be those where unforeseeable events lead to traffic of such intensity that the waiting time at the border crossing point becomes excessive, and all resources have been exhausted as regards staff, facilities and organisation.\n2.   Where border checks are relaxed in accordance with paragraph 1, border checks on entry movements shall in principle take priority over border checks on exit movements.\nThe decision to relax checks shall be taken by the border guard in command at the border crossing point.\nSuch relaxation of checks shall be temporary, adapted to the circumstances justifying it and introduced gradually.\n3.   Even in the event that checks are relaxed, the border guard shall stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals both on entry and exit, in accordance with Article 11.\n4.   Each Member State shall transmit once a year a report on the application of this Article to the European Parliament and the Commission.\nArticle 10\nSeparate lanes and information on signs\n1.   Member States shall provide separate lanes, in particular at air border crossing points in order to carry out checks on persons, in accordance with Article 8. Such lanes shall be differentiated by means of the signs bearing the indications set out in Annex III.\nMember States may provide separate lanes at their sea and land border crossing points and at borders between Member States which do not apply Article 22 at their common borders. The signs bearing the indications set out in Annex III shall be used if Member States provide separate lanes at those borders.\nMember States shall ensure that such lanes are clearly signposted, including where the rules relating to the use of the different lanes are waived as provided for in paragraph 4, in order to ensure optimal flow levels of persons crossing the border.\n2.   Persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law are entitled to use the lanes indicated by the sign shown in Part A (‘EU, EEA, CH’) of Annex III. They may also use the lanes indicated by the sign shown in Part B1 (‘visa not required’) and Part B2 (‘all passports’) of Annex III.\nThird-country nationals who are not obliged to possess a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and third-country nationals who hold a valid residence permit or long-stay visa may use the lanes indicated by the sign shown in Part B1 (‘visa not required’) of Annex III to this Regulation. They may also use the lanes indicated by the sign shown in Part B2 (‘all passports’) of Annex III to this Regulation.\nAll other persons shall use the lanes indicated by the sign shown in Part B2 (‘all passports’) of Annex III.\nThe indications on the signs referred to in the first, second and third subparagraphs may be displayed in such language or languages as each Member State considers appropriate.\nThe provision of separate lanes indicated by the sign shown in Part B1 (‘visa not required’) of Annex III is not obligatory. Member States shall decide whether to do so and at which border crossing points in accordance with practical needs.\n3.   At sea and land border crossing points, Member States may separate vehicle traffic into different lanes for light and heavy vehicles and buses by using signs as shown in Part C of Annex III.\nMember States may vary the indications on those signs where appropriate in the light of local circumstances.\n4.   In the event of a temporary imbalance in traffic flows at a particular border crossing point, the rules relating to the use of the different lanes may be waived by the competent authorities for the time necessary to eliminate such imbalance.\nArticle 11\nStamping of the travel documents\n1.   The travel documents of third-country nationals shall be systematically stamped on entry and exit. In particular an entry or exit stamp shall be affixed to:\n(a)\nthe documents, bearing a valid visa, enabling third-country nationals to cross the border;\n(b)\nthe documents enabling third-country nationals to whom a visa is issued at the border by a Member State to cross the border;\n(c)\nthe documents enabling third-country nationals not subject to a visa requirement to cross the border.\n2.   The travel documents of nationals of third countries who are members of the family of a Union citizen to whom Directive 2004/38/EC applies, but who do not present the residence card provided for in that Directive, shall be stamped on entry and exit.\nThe travel documents of nationals of third countries who are members of the family of nationals of third countries enjoying the right of free movement under Union law, but who do not present the residence card provided for in Directive 2004/38/EC, shall be stamped on entry and exit.\n3.   No entry or exit stamp shall be affixed:\n(a)\nto the travel documents of Heads of State and dignitaries whose arrival has been officially announced in advance through diplomatic channels;\n(b)\nto pilots’ licences or the certificates of aircraft crew members;\n(c)\nto the travel documents of seamen who are present within the territory of a Member State only when their ship puts in and in the area of the port of call;\n(d)\nto the travel documents of crew and passengers of cruise ships who are not subject to border checks in accordance with point 3.2.3 of Annex VI;\n(e)\nto documents enabling nationals of Andorra, Monaco and San Marino to cross the border;\n(f)\nto the travel documents of crews of passengers and goods trains on international connections;\n(g)\nto the travel documents of nationals of third countries who present a residence card provided for in Directive 2004/38/EC.\nExceptionally, at the request of a third-country national, insertion of an entry or exit stamp may be dispensed with if insertion might cause serious difficulties for that person. In that case, entry or exit shall be recorded on a separate sheet indicating that person’s name and passport number. That sheet shall be given to the third-country national. The competent authorities of the Member States may keep statistics of such exceptional cases and may provide those statistics to the Commission.\n4.   The practical arrangements for stamping are set out in Annex IV.\n5.   Whenever possible, third-country nationals shall be informed of the border guard’s obligation to stamp their travel document on entry and exit, even where checks are relaxed in accordance with Article 9.\nArticle 12\nPresumption as regards fulfilment of conditions of duration of stay\n1.   If the travel document of a third-country national does not bear an entry stamp, the competent national authorities may presume that the holder does not fulfil, or no longer fulfils, the conditions of duration of stay applicable within the Member State concerned.\n2.   The presumption referred to in paragraph 1 may be rebutted where the third-country national provides, by any means, credible evidence, such as transport tickets or proof of his or her presence outside the territory of the Member States, that he or she has respected the conditions relating to the duration of a short stay.\nIn such a case:\n(a)\nwhere the third-country national is found on the territory of a Member State applying the Schengen acquis in full, the competent authorities shall indicate, in accordance with national law and practice, in his or her travel document the date on which, and the place where, he or she crossed the external border of one of the Member States applying the Schengen acquis in full;\n(b)\nwhere the third-country national is found on the territory of a Member State in respect of which the decision contemplated in Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession, in Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession and in Article 4(2) of the 2011 Act of Accession has not been taken, the competent authorities shall indicate, in accordance with national law and practice, in his or her travel document the date on which, and the place where, he or she crossed the external border of such a Member State.\nIn addition to the indications referred to in points (a) and (b), a form as shown in Annex VIII may be given to the third-country national.\nMember States shall inform each other and the Commission and the Council General Secretariat of their national practices with regard to the indications referred to in this Article.\n3.   Should the presumption referred to in paragraph 1 not be rebutted, the third-country national may be returned in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (28) and with national law respecting that Directive.\n4.   The relevant provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis in the absence of an exit stamp.\nArticle 13\nBorder surveillance\n1.   The main purpose of border surveillance shall be to prevent unauthorised border crossings, to counter cross-border criminality and to take measures against persons who have crossed the border illegally. A person who has crossed a border illegally and who has no right to stay on the territory of the Member State concerned shall be apprehended and made subject to procedures respecting Directive 2008/115/EC.\n2.   The border guards shall use stationary or mobile units to carry out border surveillance.\nThat surveillance shall be carried out in such a way as to prevent and discourage persons from circumventing the checks at border crossing points.\n3.   Surveillance between border crossing points shall be carried out by border guards whose numbers and methods shall be adapted to existing or foreseen risks and threats. It shall involve frequent and sudden changes to surveillance periods, so that unauthorised border crossings are always at risk of being detected.\n4.   Surveillance shall be carried out by stationary or mobile units which perform their duties by patrolling or stationing themselves at places known or perceived to be sensitive, the aim of such surveillance being to apprehend individuals crossing the border illegally. Surveillance may also be carried out by technical means, including electronic means.\n5.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 37 concerning additional measures governing surveillance.\nArticle 14\nRefusal of entry\n1.   A third-country national who does not fulfil all the entry conditions laid down in Article 6(1) and does not belong to the categories of persons referred to in Article 6(5) shall be refused entry to the territories of the Member States. This shall be without prejudice to the application of special provisions concerning the right of asylum and to international protection or the issue of long-stay visas.\n2.   Entry may only be refused by a substantiated decision stating the precise reasons for the refusal. The decision shall be taken by an authority empowered by national law. It shall take effect immediately.\nThe substantiated decision stating the precise reasons for the refusal shall be given by means of a standard form, as set out in Annex V, Part B, filled in by the authority empowered by national law to refuse entry. The completed standard form shall be handed to the third-country national concerned, who shall acknowledge receipt of the decision to refuse entry by means of that form.\n3.   Persons refused entry shall have the right to appeal. Appeals shall be conducted in accordance with national law. A written indication of contact points able to provide information on representatives competent to act on behalf of the third-country national in accordance with national law shall also be given to the third-country national.\nLodging such an appeal shall not have suspensive effect on a decision to refuse entry.\nWithout prejudice to any compensation granted in accordance with national law, the third-country national concerned shall, where the appeal concludes that the decision to refuse entry was ill-founded, be entitled to correction of the cancelled entry stamp, and any other cancellations or additions which have been made, by the Member State which refused entry.\n4.   The border guards shall ensure that a third-country national refused entry does not enter the territory of the Member State concerned.\n5.   Member States shall collect statistics on the number of persons refused entry, the grounds for refusal, the nationality of the persons who were refused entry and the type of border (land, air or sea) at which they were refused entry and submit them yearly to the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (29).\n6.   Detailed rules governing refusal of entry are given in Part A of Annex V.\nCHAPTER III\nStaff and resources for border control and cooperation between Member States\nArticle 15\nStaff and resources for border control\nMember States shall deploy appropriate staff and resources in sufficient numbers to carry out border control at the external borders, in accordance with Articles 7 to 14, in such a way as to ensure an efficient, high and uniform level of control at their external borders.\nArticle 16\nImplementation of control\n1.   The border control provided for by Articles 7 to 14 shall be carried out by border guards in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation and with national law.\nWhen carrying out that border control, the powers to instigate criminal proceedings conferred on border guards by national law and falling outside the scope of this Regulation shall remain unaffected.\nMember States shall ensure that the border guards are specialised and properly trained professionals, taking into account common core curricula for border guards established and developed by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States (‘the Agency’) established by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004. Training curricula shall include specialised training for detecting and dealing with situations involving vulnerable persons, such as unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking. Member States, with the support of the Agency, shall encourage border guards to learn the languages necessary for the carrying-out of their tasks.\n2.   Member States shall notify to the Commission the list of national services responsible for border control under their national law in accordance with Article 39.\n3.   To control borders effectively, each Member State shall ensure close and constant cooperation between its national services responsible for border control.\nArticle 17\nCooperation between Member States\n1.   The Member States shall assist each other and shall maintain close and constant cooperation with a view to the effective implementation of border control, in accordance with Articles 7 to 16. They shall exchange all relevant information.\n2.   Operational cooperation between Member States in the field of management of external borders shall be coordinated by the Agency.\n3.   Without prejudice to the competences of the Agency, Member States may continue operational cooperation with other Member States and/or third countries at external borders, including the exchange of liaison officers, where such cooperation complements the action of the Agency.\nMember States shall refrain from any activity which could jeopardise the functioning of the Agency or the attainment of its objectives.\nMember States shall report to the Agency on the operational cooperation referred to in the first subparagraph.\n4.   Member States shall provide for training on the rules for border control and on fundamental rights. In that regard, account shall be taken of the common training standards as established and further developed by the Agency.\nArticle 18\nJoint control\n1.   Member States which do not apply Article 22 at their common land borders may, up to the date of application of that Article, jointly control those common borders, in which case a person may be stopped only once for the purpose of carrying out entry and exit checks, without prejudice to the individual responsibility of Member States arising from Articles 7 to 14.\nTo that end, Member States may conclude bilateral arrangements between themselves.\n2.   Member States shall inform the Commission of any arrangements concluded in accordance with paragraph 1.\nCHAPTER IV\nSpecific rules for border checks\nArticle 19\nSpecific rules for the various types of border and the various means of transport used for crossing the external borders\nThe specific rules set out in Annex VI shall apply to the checks carried out at the various types of border and on the various means of transport used for crossing border crossing points.\nThose specific rules may contain derogations from Articles 5 and 6 and Articles 8 to 14.\nArticle 20\nSpecific rules for checks on certain categories of persons\n1.   The specific rules set out in Annex VII shall apply to checks on the following categories of persons:\n(a)\nHeads of State and the members of their delegation(s);\n(b)\npilots of aircraft and other crew members;\n(c)\nseamen;\n(d)\nholders of diplomatic, official or service passports and members of international organisations;\n(e)\ncross-border workers;\n(f)\nminors;\n(g)\nrescue services, police and fire brigades and border guards;\n(h)\noffshore workers.\nThose specific rules may contain derogations from Articles 5 and 6 and Articles 8 to 14.\n2.   Member States shall notify to the Commission the model cards issued by their Ministries of Foreign Affairs to accredited members of diplomatic missions and consular representations and members of their families in accordance with Article 39.\nCHAPTER V\nSpecific measures in the case of serious deficiencies relating to external border control\nArticle 21\nMeasures at external borders and support by the Agency\n1.   Where serious deficiencies in the carrying out of external border control are identified in an evaluation report drawn up pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013, and with a view to ensuring compliance with the recommendations referred to in Article 15 of that Regulation, the Commission may recommend, by means of an implementing act, that the evaluated Member State take certain specific measures, which may include one or both of the following:\n(a)\ninitiating the deployment of European border guard teams in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004;\n(b)\nsubmitting its strategic plans, based on a risk assessment, including information on the deployment of personnel and equipment, to the Agency for its opinion thereon.\nThat implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 38(2).\n2.   The Commission shall inform the committee established pursuant to Article 38(1) on a regular basis of the progress in the implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and on its impact on the deficiencies identified.\nIt shall also inform the European Parliament and the Council.\n3.   Where an evaluation report as referred to in paragraph 1 has concluded that the evaluated Member State is seriously neglecting its obligations and must therefore report on the implementation of the relevant action plan within three months in accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013, and where, following that three-month period, the Commission finds that the situation persists, it may trigger the application of the procedure provided for in Article 29 of this Regulation where all the conditions for doing so are fulfilled.\nTITLE III\nINTERNAL BORDERS\nCHAPTER I\nAbsence of border control at internal borders\nArticle 22\nCrossing internal borders\nInternal borders may be crossed at any point without a border check on persons, irrespective of their nationality, being carried out.\nArticle 23\nChecks within the territory\nThe absence of border control at internal borders shall not affect:\n(a)\nthe exercise of police powers by the competent authorities of the Member States under national law, insofar as the exercise of those powers does not have an effect equivalent to border checks; that shall also apply in border areas. Within the meaning of the first sentence, the exercise of police powers may not, in particular, be considered equivalent to the exercise of border checks when the police measures:\n(i)\ndo not have border control as an objective;\n(ii)\nare based on general police information and experience regarding possible threats to public security and aim, in particular, to combat cross-border crime;\n(iii)\nare devised and executed in a manner clearly distinct from systematic checks on persons at the external borders;\n(iv)\nare carried out on the basis of spot-checks;\n(b)\nsecurity checks on persons carried out at ports and airports by the competent authorities under the law of each Member State, by port or airport officials or carriers, provided that such checks are also carried out on persons travelling within a Member State;\n(c)\nthe possibility for a Member State to provide by law for an obligation to hold or carry papers and documents;\n(d)\nthe possibility for a Member State to provide by law for an obligation on third-country nationals to report their presence on its territory pursuant to the provisions of Article 22 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (‘the Schengen Convention’).\nArticle 24\nRemoval of obstacles to traffic at road crossing-points at internal borders\nMember States shall remove all obstacles to fluid traffic flow at road crossing-points at internal borders, in particular any speed limits not exclusively based on road-safety considerations.\nAt the same time, Member States shall be prepared to provide for facilities for checks in the event that internal border controls are reintroduced.\nCHAPTER II\nTemporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders\nArticle 25\nGeneral framework for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders\n1.   Where, in the area without internal border control, there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security in a Member State, that Member State may exceptionally reintroduce border control at all or specific parts of its internal borders for a limited period of up to 30 days or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat if its duration exceeds 30 days. The scope and duration of the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders shall not exceed what is strictly necessary to respond to the serious threat.\n2.   Border control at internal borders shall only be reintroduced as a last resort, and in accordance with Articles 27, 28 and 29. The criteria referred to, respectively, in Articles 26 and 30 shall be taken into account in each case where a decision on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders is considered pursuant, respectively, to Article 27, 28 or 29.\n3.   If the serious threat to public policy or internal security in the Member State concerned persists beyond the period provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, that Member State may prolong border control at its internal borders, taking account of the criteria referred to in Article 26 and in accordance with Article 27, on the same grounds as those referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and, taking into account any new elements, for renewable periods of up to 30 days.\n4.   The total period during which border control is reintroduced at internal borders, including any prolongation provided for under paragraph 3 of this Article, shall not exceed six months. Where there are exceptional circumstances as referred to in Article 29, that total period may be extended to a maximum length of two years, in accordance with paragraph 1 of that Article.\nArticle 26\nCriteria for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders\nWhere a Member State decides, as a last resort, on the temporary reintroduction of border control at one or more of its internal borders or at parts thereof, or decides to prolong such reintroduction, in accordance with Article 25 or Article 28(1), it shall assess the extent to which such a measure is likely to adequately remedy the threat to public policy or internal security, and shall assess the proportionality of the measure in relation to that threat. In making such an assessment, the Member State shall, in particular, take the following into account:\n(a)\nthe likely impact of any threats to its public policy or internal security, including following terrorist incidents or threats and including those posed by organised crime;\n(b)\nthe likely impact of such a measure on free movement of persons within the area without internal border control.\nArticle 27\nProcedure for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders under Article 25\n1.   Where a Member State plans to reintroduce border control at internal borders under Article 25, it shall notify the other Member States and the Commission at the latest four weeks before the planned reintroduction, or within a shorter period where the circumstances giving rise to the need to reintroduce border control at internal borders become known less than four weeks before the planned reintroduction. To that end, the Member State shall supply the following information:\n(a)\nthe reasons for the proposed reintroduction, including all relevant data detailing the events that constitute a serious threat to its public policy or internal security;\n(b)\nthe scope of the proposed reintroduction, specifying at which part or parts of the internal borders border control is to be reintroduced;\n(c)\nthe names of the authorised crossing-points;\n(d)\nthe date and duration of the planned reintroduction;\n(e)\nwhere appropriate, the measures to be taken by the other Member States.\nA notification under the first subparagraph may also be submitted jointly by two or more Member States.\nIf necessary, the Commission may request additional information from the Member State(s) concerned.\n2.   The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council at the same time as it is notified to the other Member States and to the Commission pursuant to that paragraph.\n3.   Member States making a notification under paragraph 1 may, where necessary and in accordance with national law, decide to classify parts of the information.\nSuch classification shall not preclude information from being made available by the Commission to the European Parliament. The transmission and handling of information and documents transmitted to the European Parliament under this Article shall comply with rules concerning the forwarding and handling of classified information which are applicable between the European Parliament and the Commission.\n4.   Following notification by a Member State under paragraph 1 and with a view to consultation provided for in paragraph 5, the Commission or any other Member State may, without prejudice to Article 72 TFEU, issue an opinion.\nIf, based on the information contained in the notification or on any additional information it has received, the Commission has concerns as regards the necessity or proportionality of the planned reintroduction of border control at internal borders, or if it considers that a consultation on some aspect of the notification would be appropriate, it shall issue an opinion to that effect.\n5.   The information referred to in paragraph 1 and any Commission or Member State opinion under paragraph 4 shall be the subject of consultation, including, where appropriate, joint meetings between the Member State planning to reintroduce border control at internal borders, the other Member States, especially those directly affected by such measures, and the Commission, with a view to organising, where appropriate, mutual cooperation between the Member States and to examining the proportionality of the measures to the events giving rise to the reintroduction of border control and the threat to public policy or internal security.\n6.   The consultation referred to in paragraph 5 shall take place at least ten days before the date planned for the reintroduction of border control.\nArticle 28\nSpecific procedure for cases requiring immediate action\n1.   Where a serious threat to public policy or internal security in a Member State requires immediate action to be taken, the Member State concerned may, on an exceptional basis, immediately reintroduce border control at internal borders, for a limited period of up to ten days.\n2.   Where a Member State reintroduces border control at internal borders, it shall at the same time notify the other Member States and the Commission accordingly, and shall supply the information referred to in Article 27(1), including the reasons that justify the use of the procedure set out in this Article. The Commission may consult the other Member States immediately upon receipt of the notification.\n3.   If the serious threat to public policy or internal security persists beyond the period provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Member State may decide to prolong the border control at internal borders for renewable periods of up to 20 days. In doing so, the Member State concerned shall take into account the criteria referred to in Article 26, including an updated assessment of the necessity and the proportionality of the measure, and shall take into account any new elements.\nIn the event of such a prolongation, the provisions of Article 27(4) and (5) shall apply mutatis mutandis, and the consultation shall take place without delay after the decision to prolong has been notified to the Commission and to the Member States.\n4.

In exceptional circumstances where the overall functioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control as referred to in Article 21, and insofar as those circumstances constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security within the area without internal border control or within parts thereof, border control at internal borders may be reintroduced in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article for a period of up to six months. That period may be prolonged, no more than three times, for a further period of up to six months if the exceptional circumstances persist.\n2.   The Council may, as a last resort and as a measure to protect the common interests within the area without internal border control, where all other measures, in particular those referred to in Article 21(1), are ineffective in mitigating the serious threat identified, recommend that one or more Member States decide to reintroduce border control at all or at specific parts of their internal borders. The Council’s recommendation shall be based on a proposal from the Commission.

Within 14 days of the adoption of such recommendations, the Commission shall submit to the Council a proposal for a recommendation in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.\n5.

Where, as a last resort, the Council recommends in accordance with Article 29(2) the temporary reintroduction of border control at one or more internal borders or at parts thereof, it shall assess the extent to which such a measure is likely to adequately remedy the threat to public policy or internal security within the area without internal border control, and shall assess the proportionality of the measure in relation to that threat. That assessment shall be based on the detailed information submitted by the Member State(s) concerned and by the Commission and any other relevant information, including any information obtained pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article. In making such an assessment, the following considerations shall in particular be taken into account:\n(a)\nthe availability of technical or financial support measures which could be or have been resorted to at national or Union level, or both, including assistance by Union bodies, offices or agencies, such as the Agency, the European Asylum Support Office, established by Regulation (EU) No 439/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30) or the European Police Office (‘Europol’), established by Decision 2009/371/JHA, and the extent to which such measures are likely to adequately remedy the threat to public policy or internal security within the area without internal border control;\n(b)\nthe current and likely future impact of any serious deficiencies relating to external border control identified in the context of the evaluations carried out pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 and the extent to which such serious deficiencies constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security within the area without internal border control;\n(c)\nthe likely impact of the reintroduction of border control on the free movement of persons within the area without internal border control.\n2.   Before adopting a proposal for a Council recommendation, in accordance with Article 29(2), the Commission may:\n(a)\nrequest Member States, the Agency, Europol or other Union bodies, offices or agencies to provide it with further information;\n(b)\ncarry out on-site visits, with the support of experts from Member States and of the Agency, Europol or any other relevant Union body, office or agency, in order to obtain or verify information relevant for that recommendation.\nArticle 31\nInforming the European Parliament and the Council\nThe Commission and the Member State(s) concerned shall inform the European Parliament and the Council as soon as possible of any reasons which might trigger the application of Article 21 and Articles 25 to 30.\nArticle 32\nProvisions to be applied where border control is reintroduced at internal borders\nWhere border control at internal borders is reintroduced, the relevant provisions of Title II shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 33\nReport on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders\nWithin four weeks of the lifting of border control at internal borders, the Member State which has carried out border control at internal borders shall present a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders, outlining, in particular, the initial assessment and the respect of the criteria referred to in Articles 26, 28 and 30, the operation of the checks, the practical cooperation with neighbouring Member States, the resulting impact on the free movement of persons, the effectiveness of the reintroduction of border control at internal borders, including an ex-post assessment of the proportionality of the reintroduction of border control.\nThe Commission may issue an opinion on that ex-post assessment of the temporary reintroduction of border control at one or more internal borders or at parts thereof.\nThe Commission shall present to the European Parliament and to the Council, at least annually, a report on the functioning of the area without internal border control.

Shared border crossing points may be located either on the territory of a Member State territory or on the territory of a third country.\n1.1.4.2.\nShared border crossing points located on Member State territory: bilateral agreements establishing shared border crossing points located on Member State territory shall contain an authorisation for third-country border guards to exercise their tasks in the Member State, respecting the following principles:\n(a)\nInternational protection: a third-country national asking for international protection on Member State territory shall be given access to relevant Member State procedures in accordance with the Union asylum acquis.\n(b)\nArrest of a person or seizure of property: if third-country border guards become aware of facts justifying the arrest or placing under protection of a person or seizure of property, they shall inform Member State authorities of those facts and Member State authorities shall ensure an appropriate follow-up in accordance with national, Union and international law, independently of the nationality of the concerned person.\n(c)\nPersons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law entering Union territory: third-country border guards shall not prevent persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law from entering Union territory. If there are reasons justifying refusal of exit from the third country concerned, third-country border guards shall inform Member State authorities of those reasons and Member State authorities shall ensure an appropriate follow-up in accordance with national, Union and international law.\n1.1.4.3.\nShared border crossing points located on third-country territory: bilateral agreements establishing shared border crossing points located on third-country territory shall contain an authorisation for Member State border guards to perform their tasks in the third country. For the purpose of this Regulation, any check carried out by Member State border guards in a shared border crossing point located on the territory of a third country shall be deemed to be carried out on the territory of the Member State concerned. Member State border guards shall exercise their tasks in accordance with this Regulation and respecting the following principles:\n(a)\nInternational protection: a third-country national who has passed exit control by third-country border guards and subsequently asks Member State border guards present in the third country for international protection, shall be given access to relevant Member State procedures in accordance with Union asylum acquis. Third-country authorities shall accept the transfer of the person concerned into Member State territory.\n(b)\nArrest of a person or seizure of property: if Member State border guards become aware of facts justifying the arrest or placing under protection of a person or seizure of property, they shall act in accordance with national, Union and international law. Third-country authorities shall accept a transfer of the person or object concerned into Member State territory.\n(c)\nAccess to IT systems: Member State border guards shall be able to use information systems processing personal data in accordance with Article 8. Member States shall be allowed to establish the technical and organisational security measures required by Union law to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, including access by third-country authorities.\n1.1.4.4.\nBefore concluding or amending any bilateral agreement on shared border crossing points with a neighbouring third country, the Member State concerned shall consult the Commission as to the compatibility of the agreement with Union law. Pre-existing bilateral agreements shall be notified to the Commission by 20 January 2014.\nIf the Commission considers the agreement to be incompatible with Union law, it shall notify the Member State concerned. The Member State shall take all appropriate steps to amend the agreement within a reasonable period in such a way as to eliminate the incompatibilities established.\n1.2.   Checks on rail traffic\n1.2.1.   Checks shall be carried out both on train passengers and on railway staff on trains crossing external borders, including those on goods trains or empty trains. Member States may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on how to conduct those checks respecting the principles set out in point 1.1.4. Those checks shall be carried out in one of the following ways:\n—\nin the first station of arrival or last station of departure on the territory of a Member State;\n—\non board the train, during transit between the last station of departure in a third country and the first station of arrival on the territory of a Member State or vice versa;\n—\nin the last station of departure or the first station of arrival on the territory of a third country.\n1.2.2.   In addition, in order to facilitate rail traffic flows of high-speed passenger trains, the Member States on the itinerary of these trains from third countries may also decide, by common agreement with third countries concerned respecting the principles set out in point 1.1.4., to carry out entry checks on persons on trains from third countries in either one of the following ways:\n—\nin the stations in a third country where persons board the train;\n—\nin the stations where persons disembark within the territory of the Member States;\n—\non board the train during transit between stations on the territory of a third country and stations on the territory of the Member States, provided that the persons stay on board the train.\n1.2.3.   With respect to high-speed trains from third countries making several stops in the territory of the Member States, if the rail transport carrier is in a position to board passengers exclusively for the remaining part of the journey within the territory of the Member States, such passengers shall be subject to entry checks either on the train or at the station of destination except where checks have been carried out pursuant to points 1.2.1 or 1.2.2 first indent.\nPersons who wish to take the train exclusively for the remaining part of the journey within the territory of the Member States shall receive clear notification prior to the train’s departure that they will be subject to entry checks during the journey or at the station of destination.\n1.2.4.   When travelling in the opposite direction, the persons on board the train shall be subject to exit checks under similar arrangements.\n1.2.5.   The border guard may order the cavities of carriages to be inspected if necessary with the assistance of the train inspector, to ensure that persons or objects subject to border checks are not concealed in them.\n1.2.6.   Where there are reasons to believe that persons who have been reported or are suspected of having committed an offence, or third-country nationals intending to enter illegally, are hiding on a train, the border guard, if he or she cannot act in accordance with his national provisions, shall notify the Member States towards or within whose territory the train is moving.\n2.   Air borders\n2.1.   Procedures for checks at international airports\n2.1.1.\nThe competent authorities of the Member States shall ensure that the airport operator takes the requisite measures to physically separate the flows of passengers on internal flights from the flows of passengers on other flights. Appropriate infrastructures shall be set in place at all international airports to that end.\n2.1.2.\nThe place where border checks are carried out shall be determined in accordance with the following procedure:\n(a)\npassengers on a flight from a third country who board an internal flight shall be subject to an entry check at the airport of arrival of the flight from a third country. Passengers on an internal flight who board a flight for a third country (transfer passengers) shall be subject to an exit check at the airport of departure of the latter flight;\n(b)\nfor flights from or to third countries with no transfer passengers and flights making more than one stop-over at the airports of the Member States where there is no change of aircraft:\n(i)\npassengers on flights from or to third countries where there is no prior or subsequent transfer within the territory of the Member States shall be subject to an entry check at the airport of entry and an exit check at the airport of exit;\n(ii)\npassengers on flights from or to third countries with more than one stop-over on the territory of the Member States where there is no change of aircraft (transit passengers), and provided that passengers cannot board the aircraft for the leg situated within the territory of the Member States, shall be subject to an entry check at the airport of arrival and an exit check at the airport of departure;\n(iii)\nwhere an airline may, for flights from third countries with more than one stop-over within the territory of the Member States, board passengers only for the remaining leg within that territory, passengers shall be subject to an exit check at the airport of departure and an entry check at the airport of arrival.\nChecks on passengers who, during those stop-overs, are already on board the aircraft and have not boarded in the territory of the Member States shall be carried out in accordance with point (ii). The reverse procedure shall apply to that category of flights where the country of destination is a third country.\n2.1.3.\nBorder checks will normally not be carried out on the aircraft or at the gate, unless it is justified on the basis of an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration. In order to ensure that, at the airports designated as border crossing points, persons are checked in accordance with the rules set out in Articles 7 to 14, Member States shall ensure that the airport authorities take the requisite measures to channel passenger traffic to facilities reserved for checks.\nMember States shall ensure that the airport operator takes the necessary measures to prevent unauthorised persons entering and leaving the reserved areas, for example the transit area. Checks will normally not be carried out in the transit area, unless it is justified on the basis of an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration; in particular checks in this area may be carried out on persons subject to an airport transit visa in order to check that they are in possession of such a visa.\n2.1.4.\nWhere, in cases of force majeure or imminent danger or on the instructions of the authorities, an aircraft on a flight from a third country has to land on a landing ground which is not a border crossing point, that aircraft may continue its flight only after authorisation from the border guards and from customs. The same shall apply where an aircraft on a flight from a third country lands without permission. In any event, Articles 7 to 14 shall apply to checks on persons on those aircraft.\n2.2.   Procedures for checks in aerodromes\n2.2.1.\nIt shall be ensured that persons are also checked, in accordance with Articles 7 to 14, in airports which do not hold the status of international airport under the relevant national law (aerodromes) but through which the routing of flights from or to third countries is authorised.\n2.2.2.\nBy way of derogation from point 2.1.1 it shall not be necessary to make appropriate arrangements in aerodromes to ensure that inflows of passengers from internal and other flights are physically separated, without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). In addition, when the volume of traffic is low, the border guards need not be present at all times, provided that there is a guarantee that the necessary personnel can be deployed in good time.\n2.2.3.\nWhen the presence of the border guards is not assured at all times in the aerodrome, the manager of the aerodrome shall give adequate notice to the border guards about the arrival and the departure of aircrafts on flights from or to third countries.\n2.3.   Checks on persons on private flights\n2.3.1.\nIn the case of private flights from or to third countries the captain shall transmit to the border guards of the Member State of destination and, where appropriate, of the Member State of first entry, prior to take-off, a general declaration comprising inter alia a flight plan in accordance with Annex 2 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation and information concerning the passengers’ identity.\n2.3.2.\nWhere private flights coming from a third country and bound for a Member State make stop-overs in the territory of other Member States, the competent authorities of the Member State of entry shall carry out border checks and affix an entry stamp to the general declaration referred to in point 2.3.1.\n2.3.3.\nWhere uncertainty exists whether a flight is exclusively coming from, or solely bound for, the territories of the Member States without stop-over on the territory of a third country, the competent authorities shall carry out checks on persons in airports and aerodromes in accordance with points 2.1 to 2.2.\n2.3.4.\nThe arrangements for the entry and exit of gliders, micro-light aircraft, helicopters, small-scale aircraft capable of flying short distances only and airships shall be laid down by national law and, where applicable, by bilateral agreements.\n3.   Sea borders\n3.1.   General checking procedures on maritime traffic\n3.1.1.\nChecks on ships shall be carried out at the port of arrival or departure, or in an area set aside for that purpose, located in the immediate vicinity of the vessel or on board ship in the territorial waters as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Member States may conclude agreements according to which checks may also be carried out during crossings or, upon the ship’s arrival or departure, on the territory of a third country, respecting the principles set out in point 1.1.4.\n3.1.2.\nThe master, the ship’s agent or some other person duly authorised by the master or authenticated in a manner acceptable to the public authority concerned (in both cases ‘the master’), shall draw up a list of the crew and any passengers containing the information required in the forms 5 (crew list) and 6 (passenger list) of the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (FAL Convention) as well as, where applicable, the visa or residence permit numbers:\n—\nat the latest twenty-four hours before arriving in the port, or\n—\nat the latest at the time the ship leaves the previous port, if the voyage time is less than twenty-four hours, or\n—\nif the port of call is not known or it is changed during the voyage, as soon as this information is available.\nThe master shall communicate the list(s) to the border guards or, if national law so provides, to other relevant authorities which shall forward the list(s) without delay to the border guards.\n3.1.3.\nA confirmation of receipt (signed copy of the list(s) or an electronic receipt confirmation) shall be returned to the master by the border guards or by the authorities referred to in point 3.1.2., who shall produce it on request when the ship is in port.\n3.1.4.\nThe master shall promptly report to the competent authority any changes to the composition of the crew or the number of passengers.\nIn addition, the master shall notify the competent authorities promptly, and within the time-limit set out in point 3.1.2., of the presence on board of stowaways. Stowaways, however, remain under the responsibility of the master.\nBy way of derogation from Articles 5 and 8, no systematic border checks shall be carried out on persons staying aboard. Nevertheless a search of the ship and checks on the persons staying aboard shall be carried out by border guards only when this is justified on the basis of an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration.\n3.1.5.\nThe master shall notify the competent authority of the ship’s departure in due time and in accordance with the rules in force in the port concerned.\n3.2.   Specific check procedures for certain types of shipping\nCruise ships\n3.2.1.\nThe cruise ship’s master shall transmit to the competent authority the itinerary and the programme of the cruise, as soon as they have been established and no later than within the time-limit set out in point 3.1.2.\n3.2.2.\nIf the itinerary of a cruise ship comprises exclusively ports situated in the territory of the Member States, by way of derogation from Articles 5 and 8, no border checks shall be carried out and the cruise ship may dock at ports which are not border crossing points.\nNevertheless, checks shall be carried out on the crew and passengers of those ships only when this is justified on the basis of an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration.\n3.2.3.\nIf the itinerary of a cruise ship comprises both ports situated in the territory of the Member States and ports situated in third countries, by way of derogation from Article 8, border checks shall be carried out as follows:\n(a)\nwhere the cruise ship comes from a port situated in a third country and calls for the first time at a port situated in the territory of a Member State, crew and passengers shall be subject to entry checks on the basis of the nominal lists of crew and passengers, as referred to in point 3.1.2.\nPassengers going ashore shall be subject to entry checks in accordance with Article 8 unless an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration shows that there is no need to carry out such checks;\n(b)\nwhere the cruise ship comes from a port situated in a third country and calls again at a port situated in the territory of a Member State, crew and passengers shall be subject to entry checks on the basis of the nominal lists of crew and passengers as referred to in point 3.1.2. to the extent that those lists have been modified since the cruise ship called at the previous port situated in the territory of a Member State.\nPassengers going ashore shall be subject to entry checks in accordance with Article 8 unless an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration shows that there is no need to carry out such checks;\n(c)\nwhere the cruise ship comes from a port situated in a Member State and calls at such a port, passengers going ashore shall be subject to entry checks in accordance with Article 8 if an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration so requires;\n(d)\nwhere a cruise ship departs from a port situated in a Member State to a port in a third country, crew and passengers shall be subject to exit checks on the basis of the nominal lists of crew and passengers.\nIf an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration so requires, passengers going on board shall be subject to exit checks in accordance with Article 8;\n(e)\nwhere a cruise ship departs from a port situated in a Member State to such a port, no exit checks shall be carried out.\nNevertheless, checks shall be carried out on the crew and passengers of those ships only when this is justified on the basis of an assessment of the risks related to internal security and illegal immigration.\nPleasure boating\n3.2.4.\nBy way of derogation from Articles 5 and 8, persons on board a pleasure boat coming from or departing to a port situated in a Member State shall not be subject to border checks and may enter a port which is not a border crossing point.\nHowever, according to the assessment of the risks of illegal immigration, and in particular where the coastline of a third country is located in the immediate vicinity of the territory of the Member State concerned, checks on those persons and/or a physical search of the pleasure boat shall be carried out.\n3.2.5.\nBy way of derogation from Article 5, a pleasure boat coming from a third country may, exceptionally, enter a port which is not a border crossing point.

OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2016/399 setting out the Schengen Borders Code\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nAlso known as the ‘Schengen Borders Code’, it sets out, among other things, rules on:\ncrossing the EU’s external borders; and\nthe absence of border controls at internal borders.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe Code sets out the rules that govern:\nchecks on persons on external borders;\nentry conditions;\nthe conditions of temporary reintroduction of border controls at internal borders in the Schengen area (a border-free area comprising 22 EU countries, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) in the event of a serious threat to public policy or internal security.\nTo whom does it apply?\nThe ‘Schengen Borders Code’ lays down the rules that apply to any person crossing the external borders of the Schengen area. Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia and Romania are not yet full members of the Schengen area but must follow the rules concerning controls at the external borders.\nExternal borders\nWhen crossing external borders, nationals of non-EU countries not benefiting from the freedom of movement under EU law are subject to thorough checks in accordance with the conditions of entry into the country, including systematic consultation of relevant databases such as Schengen Information System (SIS) as well as verification of the Visa Information System (VIS) if the person is subject to the visa obligation.\nIn the event of an intended stay on the territory of a Schengen country, for no more than 90 days in any 180-day period, non-EU country nationals must:\nbe in possession of a valid travel document and visa, if required;\njustify the purpose and the conditions of their intended stay and prove that they have sufficient means of subsistence;\nnot be the subject of an alert in the Schengen SIS for the purpose of refusing entry; and\nnot be considered a threat to EU public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the EU countries.\nEntry of a third country national (a non-Schengen or non-EU country) who is not benefiting from the freedom of movement under EU law may only be refused by a decision taken by a relevant national authority stating the precise reasons for the refusal and may be subject to appeal.\nInternal borders\nIn the area without internal border controls (meaning the Schengen area with the exception of Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), any person of any nationality may cross any internal border without border checks being carried out. Nevertheless, national police authorities have the right to carry out police checks, including in the border area, subject to specific rules and limitations.\nCountries which are part of the area without internal border controls must remove all obstacles to smooth traffic flow at road crossing-points at internal borders, and in particular any speed limits not exclusively based on road-safety considerations.\nTemporary reintroduction of internal border controls\nInternal border controls may be exceptionally restored inside the Schengen area for a limited period of time where:\nthere is a serious threat to public policy or internal security: border controls may be reintroduced by the affected Schengen countries for a maximum duration of 6 months in case of foreseeable events (e.g. important sport events, conferences, etc.) and for a maximum of 2 months in case of events requiring immediate action;\nthe Schengen evaluation mechanism* reveals that there are serious and persistent flaws in external border controls putting the overall functioning of the Schengen area at risk. In such cases, the Council may recommend that one or more EU countries reintroduce border controls at all or at specific parts of their internal borders for a maximum of 2 years.\nRecent amendments of the Schengen Borders Code\nSystematic checks against relevant databases at external borders\nSince April 2017, Regulation (EU) 2017/458 has required systematic checks against relevant databases to be carried out on EU/EEA (European Union/European Economic Area)/Swiss citizens at the external borders of the Schengen area, in addition to the existing checks already undertaken on non-EU nationals. The new rules were introduced in response to the terrorist attacks that have hit various EU countries in recent years and should help in particular to address the threats of EU-born terrorist fighters going to or returning from abroad. The checks take place both at entry and at exit of the external borders. The checks are made against databases such as the SIS and Interpol’s database on stolen and lost travel documents.\nEntry Exit System\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2225 amends Regulation (EU) 2016/399 to take account of the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 which created a centralised system for the registration of entry and exit data (Entry-exit system — EES) in regard to non-EU nationals coming for a short-stay, once the latter enters into force. The main objective of Regulation (EU) 2017/2225 is to replace the stamping of the travel document on entry and exit by the electronic recording of the entry and exit directly in the EES. The use of automated border control systems for persons subject to registration in the EES has been integrated. Schengen countries are also able to establish national facilitation programmes to allow pre-vetted non-EU nationals to benefit on entry from exceptions from certain aspects of border checks. Regulation (EU) 2017/2225 will start to apply only from the date of entry into force of the EES.\neu-LISA, the agency responsible for managing the EU’s large-scale information technology (IT) systems relevant to freedom, security and justice, is already responsible for the operation of the 3 EU information technology systems essential for safeguarding the Schengen area and border management. These are:\nthe Eurodac (EU asylum dactyloscopic database which allows fingerprint comparisons),\nthe SIS and\nthe VIS.\nUnder Regulation (EU) 2017/2226, eu-LISA is given the additional task of developing the EES and ensuring it is well managed.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 12 April 2016. Regulation (EU) 2016/399 codifies and replaces Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (and its subsequent amendments).\nThe Schengen Borders Code, as first adopted on 15 March 2006 (Regulation (EC) No 562/2006), has applied since 13 October 2006.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nBorder crossing (European Commission)\nTemporary reintroduction of border control (European Commission)\nSchengen, borders & visas (European Commission).\n            \nCommunication from the Commission — Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak\nCommunication from the Commission — COVID-19 Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, on the facilitation of transit arrangements for the repatriation of EU citizens, and on the effects on visa policy\nKEY TERMS\n              \nSchengen evaluation mechanism: a system set up by Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 with which the EU countries and the Commission must jointly conduct regular evaluations to check that the Schengen EU law in the area of management of the external as well as the absence of border control at internal borders, including the Schengen Borders Code, is being correctly applied. If serious deficiencies are found in the performance of external border controls, the European Commission may recommend that an EU country take specific measures. In case of serious and repeated deficiencies, internal border controls may be reintroduced as a measure of last resort.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (codification) (OJ L 77, 23.3.2016, pp. 1-52)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 2016/399 have been incorporated in to the original document.
