{"celex_id": "32017R0746", "reference": "5.5.2017\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 117/176\nREGULATION (EU) 2017/746 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 5 April 2017\non in vitro diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article 168(4)(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) constitutes the Union regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. However, a fundamental revision of that Directive is needed to establish a robust, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices which ensures a high level of safety and health whilst supporting innovation.\n(2)\nThis Regulation aims to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market as regards in vitro diagnostic medical devices, taking as a base a high level of protection of health for patients and users, and taking into account the small and medium-sized enterprises that are active in this sector. At the same time, this Regulation sets high standards of quality and safety for in vitro diagnostic medical devices in order to meet common safety concerns as regards such products. Both objectives are being pursued simultaneously and are inseparably linked whilst one not being secondary to the other. As regards Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this Regulation harmonises the rules for the placing on the market and putting into service of in vitro diagnostic medical devices and their accessories on the Union market thus allowing them to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods. As regards Article 168(4)(c) TFEU, this Regulation sets high standards of quality and safety for in vitro diagnostic medical devices by ensuring, among other things, that data generated in performance studies are reliable and robust and that the safety of subjects participating in performance studies is protected.\n(3)\nThis Regulation does not seek to harmonise rules relating to the further making available on the market of in vitro diagnostic medical devices after they have already been put into service, such as in the context of second-hand sales.\n(4)\nKey elements of the existing regulatory approach, such as the supervision of notified bodies, risk classification, conformity assessment procedures, performance evaluation and performance studies, vigilance and market surveillance should be significantly reinforced, whilst provisions ensuring transparency and traceability regarding in vitro diagnostic medical devices should be introduced, to improve health and safety.\n(5)\nTo the extent possible, guidance developed for in vitro diagnostic medical devices at international level, in particular in the context of the Global Harmonization Task Force and its follow-up initiative, the International Medical Devices Regulators Forum, should be taken into account to promote the global convergence of regulations which contributes to a high level of safety protection worldwide, and to facilitate trade, in particular in the provisions on Unique Device Identification, general safety and performance requirements, technical documentation, classification rules, conformity assessment procedures and clinical evidence.\n(6)\nThere are specific features of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, in particular in terms of risk classification, conformity assessment procedures and clinical evidence, and of the in vitro diagnostic medical device sector which require the adoption of specific legislation, distinct from the legislation on other medical devices, whereas the horizontal aspects common to both sectors should be aligned.\n(7)\nThe scope of application of this Regulation should be clearly delimited from other legislation concerning products, such as medical devices, general laboratory products and products for research use only.\n(8)\nIt should be the responsibility of the Member States to decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not a product falls within the scope of this Regulation. In order to ensure consistent qualification decisions in that regard across all Member States, particularly with regard to borderline cases, the Commission should be allowed to, on its own initiative or at the duly substantiated request of a Member State, having consulted the Medical Device Coordination Group (‘MDCG’), decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not a specific product, category or group of products falls within the scope of this Regulation. When deliberating on the regulatory status of products in borderline cases involving medicinal products, human tissues and cells, biocidal products or food products, the Commission should ensure an appropriate level of consultation of the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Food Safety Authority, as relevant.\n(9)\nIt appears that it is possible that divergent national rules regarding the provision of information and counselling in relation to genetic testing might only have an impact on the smooth functioning of the internal market to a limited extent. Therefore, it is appropriate to lay down only limited requirements in this regard in this Regulation, having regard to the need to ensure constant respect of the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.\n(10)\nIt should be made clear that all tests that provide information on the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease, such as genetic tests, and tests that provide information to predict treatment response or reactions, such as companion diagnostics, are in vitro diagnostic medical devices.\n(11)\nCompanion diagnostics are essential for defining patients' eligibility for specific treatment with a medicinal product through the quantitative or qualitative determination of specific markers identifying subjects at a higher risk of developing an adverse reaction to the medicinal product in question or identifying patients in the population for whom the therapeutic product has been adequately studied, and found safe and effective. Such biomarker or biomarkers can be present in healthy subjects and/or in patients.\n(12)\nDevices that are used with a view to monitoring treatment with a medicinal product in order to ensure that the concentration of relevant substances in the human body is within the therapeutic window are not considered to be companion diagnostics.\n(13)\nThe requirement to reduce risks as far as possible should be fulfilled taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art in the field of medicine.\n(14)\nSafety aspects addressed by Directive 2014/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) are an integral part of the general safety and performance requirements laid down in this Regulation for devices. Consequently, this Regulation should be considered a lex specialis in relation to that Directive.\n(15)\nThis Regulation should include requirements regarding the design and manufacture of devices emitting ionizing radiation without affecting the application of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom (5) which pursues other objectives.\n(16)\nThis Regulation should include requirements for devices' safety and performance characteristics which are developed in such a way as to prevent occupational injuries, including protection from radiation.\n(17)\nIt is necessary to clarify that software in its own right, when specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used for one or more of the medical purposes set out in the definition of an in vitro diagnostic medical device, qualifies as an in vitro diagnostic medical device, while software for general purposes, even when used in a healthcare setting, or software intended for well-being purposes is not an in vitro diagnostic medical device. The qualification of software, either as a device or an accessory, is independent of the software's location or the type of interconnection between the software and a device.\n(18)\nThe definitions in this Regulation regarding the devices themselves, the making available of devices, economic operators, users and specific processes, the conformity assessment, clinical evidence, post-market surveillance, vigilance and market surveillance, standards and other technical specifications, should be aligned with well-established practice in the field at Union and international level in order to enhance legal certainty.\n(19)\nIt should be made clear that it is essential that devices offered to persons in the Union by means of information society services within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and devices used in the context of a commercial activity to provide a diagnostic or therapeutic service to persons within the Union comply with the requirements of this Regulation, where the product in question is placed on the market or the service is provided in the Union.\n(20)\nTo recognise the important role of standardisation in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, compliance with harmonised standards as defined in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) should be a means for manufacturers to demonstrate conformity with the general safety and performance requirements and other legal requirements, such as those relating to quality and risk management, laid down in this Regulation.\n(21)\nDirective 98/79/EC allows the Commission to adopt common technical specifications for specific categories of in vitro diagnostic medical devices. In areas where no harmonised standards exist or where they are insufficient, the Commission should be empowered to lay down common specifications which provide a means of complying with the general safety and performance requirements and the requirements for performance studies and performance evaluation and/or post-market follow-up, laid down in this Regulation.\n(22)\nCommon specifications (‘CS’) should be developed after consulting the relevant stakeholders and taking account of the European and international standards.\n(23)\nThe rules applicable to devices should be aligned, where appropriate, with the New Legislative Framework for the Marketing of Products, which consists of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) and Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n(24)\nThe rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market laid down in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to devices covered by this Regulation which does not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.\n(25)\nIt is appropriate to set out clearly the general obligations of the different economic operators, including importers and distributors, building on the New Legislative Framework for the Marketing of Products, without prejudice to the specific obligations laid down in the various parts of this Regulation, to enhance understanding of the requirements laid down in this Regulation and thus to improve regulatory compliance by the relevant operators.\n(26)\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the activities of distributors should be deemed to include acquisition, holding and supplying of devices.\n(27)\nSeveral of the obligations on manufacturers, such as performance evaluation or vigilance reporting, that were set out only in the Annexes to Directive 98/79/EC, should be incorporated into the enacting provisions of this Regulation to facilitate its application.\n(28)\nTo ensure the highest level of health protection, the rules governing in vitro diagnostic medical devices, manufactured and used within a single health institution only, should be clarified and strengthened. That use should be understood to include measurement and delivery of results.\n(29)\nHealth institutions should have the possibility of manufacturing, modifying and using devices in-house and thereby addressing, on a non-industrial scale, the specific needs of target patient groups which cannot be met at the appropriate level of performance by an equivalent device available on the market. In that context, it is appropriate to provide that certain rules of this Regulation, as regards devices manufactured and used only within health institutions, including hospitals as well as institutions, such as laboratories and public health institutes that support the health care system and/or address patient needs, but which do not treat or care for patients directly, should not apply, since the aims of this Regulation would still be met in a proportionate manner. It should be noted that the concept of ‘health institution’ does not cover establishments primarily claiming to pursue health interests or healthy lifestyles, such as gyms, spas, wellness and fitness centres. As a result, the exemption applicable to health institutions does not apply to such establishments.\n(30)\nIn view of the fact that natural or legal persons can claim compensation for damage caused by a defective device in accordance with applicable Union and national law, it is appropriate to require manufacturers to have measures in place to provide sufficient financial coverage in respect of their potential liability under Council Directive 85/374/EEC (10). Such measures should be proportionate to the risk class, type of device and the size of the enterprise. In this context, it is also appropriate to lay down rules concerning the facilitation, by a competent authority, of the provision of information to persons who may have been injured by a defective device.\n(31)\nTo ensure that devices manufactured in series production continue to be in conformity with the requirements of this Regulation and that experience from the use of the devices they manufacture is taken into account for the production process, all manufacturers should have a quality management system and a post-market surveillance system in place which should be proportionate to the risk class and the type of the device in question. In addition, in order to minimize risks or prevent incidents related to devices, manufacturers should establish a system for risk management and a system for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions.\n(32)\nThe risk management system should be carefully aligned with and reflected in the performance evaluation process for the device, including the clinical risks to be addressed as part of performance studies, performance evaluation and post-market performance follow-up. The risk management and performance evaluation processes should be inter-dependent and should be regularly updated.\n(33)\nIt should be ensured that supervision and control of the manufacture of devices, as well as post-market surveillance and vigilance activities concerning them, are carried out within the manufacturer's organisation by a person responsible for regulatory compliance who fulfils minimum conditions of qualification.\n(34)\nFor manufacturers who are not established in the Union, the authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring the compliance of the devices produced by those manufacturers and in serving as their contact person established in the Union. Given that pivotal role, for the purposes of enforcement it is appropriate to make the authorised representative legally liable for defective devices in the event that a manufacturer established outside the Union has not complied with its general obligations. The liability of the authorised representative provided for in this Regulation is without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 85/374/EEC, and accordingly the authorised representative should be jointly and severally liable with the importer and the manufacturer. The tasks of an authorised representative should be defined in a written mandate. Considering the role of authorised representatives, the minimum requirements they should meet should be clearly defined, including the requirement of having available a person who fulfils minimum conditions of qualification which should be similar to those for a manufacturer's person responsible for regulatory compliance.\n(35)\nTo ensure legal certainty in respect of the obligations incumbent on economic operators, it is necessary to clarify when a distributor, importer or other person is to be considered the manufacturer of a device.\n(36)\nParallel trade in products already placed on the market is a lawful form of trade within the internal market on the basis of Article 34 TFEU subject to the limitations arising from the need for protection of health and safety and from the need for protection of intellectual property rights provided for under Article 36 TFEU. Application of the principle of parallel trade is, however, subject to different interpretations in the Member States. The conditions, in particular the requirements for relabelling and repackaging, should therefore be specified in this Regulation, taking into account the case-law of the Court of Justice (11) in other relevant sectors and existing good practice in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices.\n(37)\nDevices should, as a general rule, bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with this Regulation so that they can move freely within the Union and be put into service in accordance with their intended purpose. Member States should not create obstacles to the placing on the market or putting into service of devices that comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation. However, Member States should be allowed to decide whether to restrict the use of any specific type of device in relation to aspects that are not covered by this Regulation.\n(38)\nThe traceability of devices by means of a Unique Device Identification system (UDI system) based on international guidance should significantly enhance the effectiveness of the post-market safety-related activities for devices, which is owing to improved incident reporting, targeted field safety corrective actions and better monitoring by competent authorities. It should also help to reduce medical errors and to fight against falsified devices. Use of the UDI system should also improve purchasing and waste disposal policies and stock-management by health institutions and other economic operators and, where possible, be compatible with other authentication systems already in place in those settings.\n(39)\nThe UDI system should apply to all devices placed on the market except devices for performance studies, and be based on internationally recognised principles including definitions that are compatible with those used by major trade partners. In order for the UDI system to become functional in time for the application of this Regulation, detailed rules should be laid down in this Regulation and in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(40)\nTransparency and adequate access to information, appropriately presented for the intended user, are essential in the public interest, to protect public health, to empower patients and healthcare professionals and to enable them to make informed decisions, to provide a sound basis for regulatory decision-making and to build confidence in the regulatory system.\n(41)\nOne key aspect in fulfilling the objectives of this Regulation is the creation of a European database on medical devices (Eudamed) that should integrate different electronic systems to collate and process information regarding devices on the market and the relevant economic operators, certain aspects of conformity assessment, notified bodies, certificates, performance studies, vigilance and market surveillance. The objectives of the database are to enhance overall transparency, including through better access to information for the public and healthcare professionals, to avoid multiple reporting requirements, to enhance coordination between Member States and to streamline and facilitate the flow of information between economic operators, notified bodies or sponsors and Member States as well as between Member States among themselves and with the Commission. Within the internal market, this can be ensured effectively only at Union level and the Commission should therefore further develop and manage the European databank on medical devices set up by Commission Decision 2010/227/EU (13).\n(42)\nTo facilitate the functioning of Eudamed, an internationally recognised medical device nomenclature should be available free of charge to manufacturers and other natural or legal persons required by this Regulation to use that nomenclature. Furthermore, that nomenclature should be available, where reasonably practicable, free of charge also to other stakeholders.\n(43)\nEudamed's electronic systems regarding devices on the market, the relevant economic operators and certificates should enable the public to be adequately informed about devices on the Union market. The electronic system on performance studies should serve as a tool for the cooperation between Member States and for enabling sponsors to submit, on a voluntary basis, a single application for several Member States and to report serious adverse events, device deficiencies and related updates. The electronic system on vigilance should enable manufacturers to report serious incidents and other reportable events and to support the coordination of the evaluation of such incidents and events by competent authorities. The electronic system regarding market surveillance should be a tool for the exchange of information between competent authorities.\n(44)\nIn respect of data collated and processed through the electronic systems of Eudamed, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) applies to the processing of personal data carried out in the Member States, under the supervision of the Member States' competent authorities, in particular the public independent authorities designated by the Member States. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) applies to the processing of personal data carried out by the Commission within the framework of this Regulation, under the supervision of the European Data Protection Supervisor. In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, the Commission should be designated as the controller of Eudamed and its electronic systems.\n(45)\nFor class C and D devices, manufacturers should summarise the main safety and performance aspects of the device and the outcome of the performance evaluation in a document that should be publicly available.\n(46)\nThe proper functioning of notified bodies is crucial for ensuring a high level of health and safety protection and citizens' confidence in the system. Designation and monitoring of notified bodies by the Member States, in accordance with detailed and strict criteria, should therefore be subject to controls at Union level.\n(47)\nNotified bodies' assessments of manufacturers' technical documentation, in particular documentation on performance evaluation, should be critically evaluated by the authority responsible for notified bodies. That evaluation should be part of the risk-based approach to the oversight and monitoring activities of notified bodies and should be based on sampling of the relevant documentation.\n(48)\nThe position of notified bodies vis-à-vis manufacturers should be strengthened, including with regard to their right and duty to carry out unannounced on-site audits and to conduct physical or laboratory tests on devices to ensure continuous compliance by manufacturers after receipt of the original certification.\n(49)\nTo increase transparency with regard to the oversight of notified bodies by national authorities, the authorities responsible for notified bodies should publish information on the national measures governing the assessment, designation and monitoring of notified bodies. In accordance with good administrative practice, this information should be kept up to date by those authorities in particular to reflect relevant, significant or substantive changes to the procedures in question.\n(50)\nThe Member State in which a notified body is established should be responsible for enforcing the requirements of this Regulation with regard to that notified body.\n(51)\nIn view, in particular, of the responsibility of Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care, they should be allowed to lay down additional requirements on notified bodies designated for the conformity assessment of devices and established on their territory as far as issues that are not regulated in this Regulation are concerned. Any such additional requirements laid down should not affect more specific horizontal Union legislation on notified bodies and equal treatment of notified bodies.\n(52)\nFor class D devices, competent authorities should be informed about certificates granted by notified bodies and be given the right to scrutinise the assessment conducted by notified bodies.\n(53)\nFor class D devices for which no CS exist it is appropriate to provide that where it is the first certification for that specific type of device and there is no similar device on the market having the same intended purpose and based on similar technology, notified bodies should, in addition to the laboratory testing of the performance claimed by the manufacturer and the compliance of the device by the EU reference laboratories, be obliged to request expert panels to scrutinise their performance evaluation assessment reports. The consultation of expert panels in relation to the performance evaluation should lead to a harmonised evaluation of high-risk in vitro diagnostic medical devices by sharing expertise on performance aspects and developing CS on categories of devices that have undergone that consultation process.\n(54)\nTo enhance patient safety and to take due account of technological progress, the current classification system for devices set out in Directive 98/79/EC should be fundamentally changed, in line with international practice, and the corresponding conformity assessment procedures should be accordingly adapted.\n(55)\nIt is necessary, in particular for the purpose of the conformity assessment procedures, to classify devices in four risk classes and to establish a set of robust risk-based classification rules, in line with international practice.\n(56)\nThe conformity assessment procedure for class A devices should be carried out, as a general rule, under the sole responsibility of manufacturers, since such devices pose a low risk to patients. For class B, class C and class D devices, an appropriate level of involvement of a notified body should be compulsory.\n(57)\nThe conformity assessment procedures for devices should be further strengthened and streamlined whilst the requirements for notified bodies as regards the performance of their assessments should be clearly specified to ensure a level playing field.\n(58)\nIt is appropriate that certificates of free sale contain information that makes it possible to use Eudamed in order to obtain information on the device, in particular with regard to whether it is on the market, withdrawn from the market or recalled, and on any certificate on its conformity.\n(59)\nIt is necessary to clarify the requirements regarding batch release verification for the highest risk devices.\n(60)\nEU reference laboratories should be enabled to verify by laboratory testing the performance claimed by the manufacturer and the compliance of devices presenting the highest risk with the applicable CS, when such CS are available, or with other solutions chosen by the manufacturer to ensure a level of safety and performance that is at least equivalent.\n(61)\nTo ensure a high level of safety and performance, demonstration of compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in this Regulation should be based on clinical evidence. It is necessary to clarify the requirements for the demonstration of the clinical evidence, that is based on data on scientific validity, and the analytical performance and clinical performance of the device. To allow for a structured and transparent process, generating reliable and robust data, sourcing and assessment of available scientific information and data generated in performance studies should be based on a performance evaluation plan.\n(62)\nAs a general rule, clinical evidence should be sourced from performance studies that have been carried out under the responsibility of a sponsor. It should be possible both for the manufacturer and for another natural or legal person to be the sponsor taking responsibility for the performance study.\n(63)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the clinical evidence of devices is updated throughout their lifecycle. Such updating entails the planned monitoring of scientific developments and changes in medical practice by the manufacturer. Relevant new information should then trigger a reassessment of the clinical evidence of the device thus ensuring safety and performance through a continuous process of performance evaluation.\n(64)\nIt should be recognised that the concept of clinical benefit for in vitro diagnostic medical devices is fundamentally different from that which applies in the case of pharmaceuticals or of therapeutic medical devices, since the benefit of in vitro diagnostic medical devices lies in providing accurate medical information on patients, where appropriate, assessed against medical information obtained through the use of other diagnostic options and technologies, whereas the final clinical outcome for the patient is dependent on further diagnostic and/or therapeutic options which could be available.\n(65)\nWhere specific devices have no analytical or clinical performance or specific performance requirements are not applicable, it is appropriate to justify in the performance evaluation plan, and related reports, omissions relating to such requirements.\n(66)\nThe rules on performance studies should be in line with well-established international guidance in this field, such as the international standard ISO 14155:2011 on good clinical practice for clinical investigations of medical devices for human subjects, so as to make it easier for the results of performance studies conducted in the Union to be accepted as documentation outside the Union and to make it easier for the results of performance studies conducted outside the Union in accordance with international guidelines to be accepted within the Union. In addition, the rules should be in line with the most recent version of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\n(67)\nIt should be left to the Member State where a performance study is to be conducted to determine the appropriate authority to be involved in the assessment of the application to conduct a performance study and to organise the involvement of ethics committees within the timelines for the authorisation of that performance study as set out in this Regulation. Such decisions are a matter of internal organisation for each Member State. In that context, Member States should ensure the involvement of laypersons, in particular patients or patients' organisations. They should also ensure that the necessary expertise is available.\n(68)\nAn electronic system should be set up at Union level to ensure that every interventional clinical performance study and other performance study involving risks for the subjects of the studies is recorded and reported in a publicly accessible database. To protect the right to protection of personal data, recognised by Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’), no personal data of subjects participating in a performance study should be recorded in the electronic system. To ensure synergies with the area of clinical trials on medicinal products, the electronic system on performance studies should be interoperable with the EU database to be set up for clinical trials on medicinal products for human use.\n(69)\nWhere an interventional clinical performance study or another performance study involving risks for the subjects is to be conducted in more than one Member State, the sponsor should have the possibility of submitting a single application in order to reduce administrative burden. In order to allow for resource-sharing and to ensure consistency regarding the assessment of the health and safety-related aspects of the device for performance study and of the scientific design of that performance study, the procedure for the assessment of such single application should be coordinated between the Member States under the direction of a coordinating Member State. Such coordinated assessment should not include the assessment of intrinsically national, local and ethical aspects of a performance study, including informed consent. For an initial period of seven years from the date of application of this Regulation, Member States should be able to participate on a voluntary basis in the coordinated assessment. After that period, all Member States should be obliged to participate in the coordinated assessment. The Commission, based on the experience gained from the voluntary coordination between Member States, should draw up a report on the application of the relevant provisions regarding the coordinated assessment procedure. In the event that the findings of the report are negative, the Commission should submit a proposal to extend the period of participation on a voluntary basis in the coordinated assessment procedure.\n(70)\nSponsors should report certain adverse events and device deficiencies that occur during interventional clinical performance studies and other performance studies involving risks for the subjects to the Member States in which those studies are being conducted. Member States should have the possibility of terminating or suspending the studies or revoking the authorisation for those studies, if considered necessary to ensure a high level of protection of the subjects participating in such studies. Such information should be communicated to the other Member States.\n(71)\nThe sponsor of a performance study should submit a summary of results of the performance study that is easily understandable for the intended user together with the performance study report, where applicable, within the timelines laid down in this Regulation. Where it is not possible to submit the summary of the results within the defined timelines for scientific reasons, the sponsor should justify this and specify when the results will be submitted.\n(72)\nWith exemption of some general requirements, this Regulation should only cover performance studies intended to gather scientific data for the purpose of demonstrating conformity of devices.\n(73)\nIt is necessary to clarify that performance studies using left-over specimens need not be authorised. Nevertheless, the general requirements and other additional requirements with regard to data protection and the requirements applicable to procedures that are performed in accordance with national law such as ethical review should continue to apply to all performance studies, including when using left-over specimens.\n(74)\nThe principles of replacement, reduction and refinement in the area of animal experimentation laid down in the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and the Council (16) should be observed. In particular, the unnecessary duplication of tests and studies should be avoided.\n(75)\nManufacturers should play an active role during the post-market phase by systematically and actively gathering information from post-market experience with their devices in order to update their technical documentation and cooperate with the national competent authorities in charge of vigilance and market surveillance activities. To that end, manufacturers should establish a comprehensive post-market surveillance system, set up under their quality management system and based on a post-market surveillance plan. Relevant data and information gathered through post-market surveillance, as well as lessons learned from any implemented preventive and/or corrective actions, should be used to update any relevant part of technical documentation, such as those relating to risk assessment and performance evaluation, and should also serve the purposes of transparency.\n(76)\nIn order to better protect health and safety regarding devices on the market, the electronic system on vigilance for devices should be made more effective by creating a central portal at Union level for reporting serious incidents and field safety corrective actions.\n(77)\nMember States should take appropriate measures to raise awareness among healthcare professionals, users and patients about the importance of reporting incidents. Healthcare professionals, users and patients should be encouraged and enabled to report suspected serious incidents at national level using harmonised formats. The national competent authorities should inform manufacturers of any suspected serious incident and, where a manufacturer confirms that such an incident might have occurred, the authorities concerned should ensure that appropriate follow-up action is taken in order to minimise recurrence of such incidents.\n(78)\nThe evaluation of reported serious incidents and field safety corrective actions should be conducted at national level but coordination should be ensured where similar incidents have occurred or field safety corrective actions have to be carried out in more than one Member State, with the objective of sharing resources and ensuring consistency regarding the corrective action.\n(79)\nIn the context of the investigation of incidents, the competent authorities should take into account, where appropriate, the information provided by and views of relevant stakeholders, including patient and healthcare professionals' organisations and manufacturers' associations.\n(80)\nThe reporting of serious adverse events or device deficiencies during interventional clinical performance studies and other performance studies involving risks for the subjects, and the reporting of serious incidents occurring after a device has been placed on the market should be clearly distinguished to avoid double reporting.\n(81)\nRules on market surveillance should be included in this Regulation to reinforce the rights and obligations of the national competent authorities, to ensure effective coordination of their market surveillance activities and to clarify the applicable procedures.\n(82)\nAny statistically significant increase in the number or severity of incidents that are not serious or in expected erroneous results that could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk analysis and which could lead to unacceptable risks should be reported to the competent authorities in order to permit their assessment and the adoption of appropriate measures.\n(83)\nAn expert committee, the MDCG, composed of persons designated by the Member States based on their role and expertise in the field of medical devices including in vitro diagnostic medical devices, should be established in accordance with the conditions and modalities defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 to fulfil the tasks conferred on it by this Regulation and by Regulation (EU) 2017/745, to provide advice to the Commission and to assist the Commission and the Member States in ensuring a harmonised implementation of this Regulation. The MDCG should be able to establish subgroups in order to have access to necessary in-depth technical expertise in the field of medical devices including in vitro diagnostic medical devices. When establishing subgroups, appropriate consideration should be given to the possibility of involving existing groups at Union level in the field of medical devices.\n(84)\nCloser coordination between national competent authorities through information exchange and coordinated assessments under the direction of a coordinating authority is essential for ensuring a uniform high level of health and safety protection within the internal market, in particular in the areas of performance studies and vigilance. The principle of coordinated exchange and assessment should also apply across other authority activities described in this Regulation, such as the designation of notified bodies and should be encouraged in the area of market surveillance of devices. Joint working, coordination and communication of activities should also lead to more efficient use of resources and expertise at national level.\n(85)\nThe Commission should provide scientific, technical and corresponding logistical support to coordinating national authorities and ensure that the regulatory system for devices is effectively and uniformly implemented at Union level based on sound scientific evidence.\n(86)\nThe Union and, where appropriate, the Member States should actively participate in international regulatory cooperation in the field of devices to facilitate the exchange of safety-related information regarding devices and foster the further development of international regulatory guidelines that promote the adoption in other jurisdictions of regulations that lead to a level of health and safety protection equivalent to that set by this Regulation.\n(87)\nMember States should take all necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by laying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement.\n(88)\nWhilst this Regulation should not affect the right of Member States to levy fees for activities at national level, Member States should, in order to ensure transparency, inform the Commission and the other Member States before they decide on the level and structure of such fees. In order to further ensure transparency, the structure and level of the fees should be publicly available on request.\n(89)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter and in particular human dignity, the integrity of the person, the protection of personal data, the freedom of art and science, the freedom to conduct business and the right to property. This Regulation should be applied by the Member States in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(90)\nThe power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in order to amend certain non-essential provisions of this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law Making (17). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with preparation of delegated acts.\n(91)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18).\n(92)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for implementing acts that set out the form and presentation of the data elements of manufacturers' summaries of safety and performance, and that establish the model for certificates of free sale, given that such implementing acts are of a procedural nature and do not directly have an impact on health and safety at Union level.\n(93)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the extension to the territory of the Union of a national derogation from the applicable conformity assessment procedures, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(94)\nIn order to enable it to designate issuing entities and EU reference laboratories, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.\n(95)\nTo allow economic operators, especially SMEs, notified bodies, Member States and the Commission to adapt to the changes introduced by this Regulation and to ensure its proper application, it is appropriate to provide for a sufficient transitional period for that adaptation and for the organisational arrangements that are to be made. However, certain parts of the Regulation that directly affect Member States and the Commission should be implemented as soon as possible. It is also particularly important that, by the date of application of this Regulation, a sufficient number of notified bodies be designated in accordance with the new requirements so as to avoid any shortage of devices on the market. Nonetheless, it is necessary that any designation of a notified body in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation prior to the date of its application be without prejudice to the validity of the designation of those notified bodies under Directive 98/79/EC and to their capacity to continue issuing valid certificates under that Directive until the date of application of this Regulation.\n(96)\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition to the new rules for registration of devices and of certificates, the obligation to submit the relevant information to the electronic systems set up at Union level pursuant to this Regulation should, in the event that the corresponding IT systems are developed according to plan, only become fully effective from 18 months after the date of application of this Regulation. During this transitional period, certain provisions of Directive 98/79/EC should remain in force. However, in order to avoid multiple registrations, economic operators and notified bodies who register in the relevant electronic systems set up at Union level pursuant to this Regulation should be considered to be in compliance with the registration requirements adopted by the Member States pursuant to those provisions.\n(97)\nIn order to provide for a smooth introduction of the UDI system, the moment of application of the obligation to place the UDI carrier on the label of the device should vary from one to five years after the date of application of this Regulation depending upon the class of the device concerned.\n(98)\nDirective 98/79/EC should be repealed to ensure that only one set of rules applies to the placing of in vitro diagnostic medical devices on the market and the related aspects covered by this Regulation. Manufacturers' obligations as regards the making available of documentation regarding devices they placed on the market and manufacturers' and Member States' obligations as regards vigilance activities for devices placed on the market pursuant to that Directive should however continue to apply. While it should be left to Member States to decide how to organise vigilance activities, it is desirable for them to have the possibility of reporting adverse incidents related to devices placed on the market pursuant to that Directive using the same tools as those for reporting on devices placed on the market pursuant to this Regulation. However, Decision 2010/227/EU adopted in implementation of that Directive and Council Directives 90/385/EEC (19) and 93/42/EEC (20) should also be repealed as from the date when Eudamed becomes fully functional.\n(99)\nThe requirements of this Regulation should be applicable to all devices placed on the market or put into service from the date of application of this Regulation. However, in order to provide for a smooth transition it should be possible, for a limited period of time from that date, for devices to be placed on the market or put into service by virtue of a valid certificate issued pursuant to Directive 98/79/EC.\n(100)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor has given an opinion (21) pursuant to Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n(101)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market as regards medical devices and to ensure high standards of quality and safety for in vitro diagnostic medical devices, thus ensuring a high level of protection of health and safety of patients, users and other persons, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS\nSection 1\nScope and definitions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

In cases of early termination or temporary halt, the summary and the report shall become publicly accessible immediately after submission.\nIf the device is not registered in accordance with Article 26 within one year of the summary and the performance study report having been entered into the electronic system pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article, they shall become publicly accessible at that point in time.\nArticle 74\nCoordinated assessment procedure for performance studies\n1.   By means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69, the sponsor of a performance study to be conducted in more than one Member State may submit, for the purpose of Article 66, a single application that, upon receipt, is transmitted electronically to all Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted.\n2.   The sponsor shall propose in the single application referred to in paragraph 1 that one of the Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted acts as coordinating Member State. The Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted shall, within six days of submission of the application, agree on one of them taking the role of the coordinating Member State. If they do not agree on a coordinating Member State, the coordinating Member State proposed by the sponsor shall assume that role.\n3.   Under the direction of the coordinating Member State referred to in paragraph 2, the Member States concerned shall coordinate their assessment of the application, in particular of the documentation referred to in Chapter I of Annex XIV.\nHowever, the completeness of the documentation referred to in Sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV and point (c) of Section 2.3.2. of Part A of Annex XIII shall be assessed separately by each Member State concerned in accordance with Article 66(1) to (5).\n4.   With regard to documentation other than that referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, the coordinating Member State shall:\n(a)\nwithin six days of receipt of the single application, notify the sponsor that it is the coordinating Member State (‘notification date’);\n(b)\nfor the purpose of the validation of the application, take into account any considerations submitted within seven days of the notification date by any Member State concerned;\n(c)\nwithin 10 days of the notification date, assess whether the performance study falls within the scope of this Regulation and whether the application is complete and shall notify the sponsor accordingly. Article 66(1) and (3) to (5) shall apply to the coordinating Member State in relation to that assessment;\n(d)\nestablish the results of its assessment in a draft assessment report to be transmitted within 26 days of the validation date to the Member States concerned. By day 38 after the validation date, the other Member States concerned shall transmit their comments and proposals on the draft assessment report and the underlying application to the coordinating Member State which shall take due account of those comments and proposals in its finalisation of the final assessment report, to be transmitted within 45 days of the validation date to the sponsor and the other Member States concerned.\nThe final assessment report shall be taken into account by all Member States concerned when deciding on the sponsor's application in accordance with Article 66(7).\n5.   As regards the assessment of the documentation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, each Member State concerned may request, on a single occasion, additional information from the sponsor. The sponsor shall submit the requested additional information within the period set by the Member State concerned, which shall not exceed 12 days from the receipt of the request. The expiry of the last deadline pursuant to point (d) of paragraph 4 shall be suspended from the date of the request until such time as the additional information has been received.\n6.   For class C and D devices, the coordinating Member State may also extend the periods referred to in paragraph 4 by a further 50 days, for the purpose of consulting with experts.\n7.   The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, further specify the procedures and timescales for coordinated assessments to be taken into account by Member States concerned when deciding on the sponsor's application. Such implementing acts may also set out the procedures and timescales for coordinated assessment in the case of substantial modifications pursuant to paragraph 12 of this Article and in the case of reporting of adverse events pursuant to Article 76(4) and in the case of performance studies involving companion diagnostics, where the medicinal products are under a concurrent coordinated assessment of a clinical trial under Regulation (EU) No 536/2014. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3).\n8.   Where the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment is that the conduct of the performance study is acceptable or acceptable subject to compliance with specific conditions, that conclusion shall be deemed to be the conclusion of all Member State(s) concerned.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, a Member State concerned may only disagree with the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment on the following grounds:\n(a)\nwhen it considers that participation in the performance study would lead to a subject receiving treatment inferior to that received in normal clinical practice in that Member State concerned;\n(b)\ninfringement of national law; or\n(c)\nconsiderations as regards subject safety and data reliability and robustness submitted under point (d) of paragraph 4.\nWhere one of the Member States concerned disagrees with the conclusion on the basis of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, it shall communicate its disagreement, together with a detailed justification, through the electronic system referred to in Article 69 to the Commission, to all other Member States concerned, and to the sponsor.\n9.   Where the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment is that the performance study is not acceptable, that conclusion shall be deemed to be the conclusion of all Member States concerned.\n10.   A Member State concerned shall refuse to authorise a performance study if it disagrees with the conclusion of the coordinating Member State as regards any of the grounds referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 8, or if it finds, on duly justified grounds, that the aspects addressed in Sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV are not complied with, or where an ethics committee has issued a negative opinion in relation to that performance study which is valid in accordance with national law for that entire Member State. That Member State shall provide for an appeal procedure in respect of such refusal.\n11.   Each Member State concerned shall notify the sponsor through the electronic system referred to in Article 69 as to whether the performance study is authorised, whether it is authorised subject to conditions, or whether authorisation has been refused. Notification shall be done by way of one single decision within five days of the transmission, pursuant to point (d) of paragraph 4 of this Article, by the coordinating Member State of the final assessment report. Where an authorisation of a performance study is subject to conditions, those conditions may only be such that, by their nature, they cannot be fulfilled at the time of that authorisation.\n12.   Any substantial modifications as referred to in Article 71 shall be notified to the Member States concerned by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69. Any assessment as to whether there are grounds for disagreement as referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 8 of this Article shall be carried out under the direction of the coordinating Member State, except for substantial modifications concerning sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV and point (c) of Section 2.3.2 of Part A of Annex XIII, which shall be assessed separately by each Member State concerned.\n13.   The Commission shall provide administrative support to the coordinating Member State in the accomplishment of its tasks under this Chapter.\n14.   The procedure set out in this Article shall, until 27 May 2029, be applied only by those of the Member States in which the performance studies are to be conducted which have agreed to apply it. After 27 May 2029, all Member States shall be required to apply that procedure.\nArticle 75\nReview of the coordinated assessment procedure\nBy 27 May 2028, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the experience gained from the application of Article 74 and, if necessary, propose a review of Article 74(14) and point (g) of Article 113(3).\nArticle 76\nRecording and reporting of adverse events that occur during performance studies\n1.   The sponsor shall fully record all of the following:\n(a)\nany adverse event of a type identified in the performance study plan as being critical to the evaluation of the results of that performance study;\n(b)\nany serious adverse event;\n(c)\nany device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action had not been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate;\n(d)\nany new findings in relation to any event referred to in points (a) to (c).\n2.   The sponsor shall report without delay to all Member States in which a performance study is being conducted all of the following by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69:\n(a)\nany serious adverse event that has a causal relationship with the device, the comparator or the study procedure or where such causal relationship is reasonably possible;\n(b)\nany device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action had not been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate;\n(c)\nany new findings in relation to any event referred to in points (a) and (b).\nThe period for reporting shall take account of the severity of the event. Where necessary to ensure timely reporting, the sponsor may submit an initial report that is incomplete followed up by a complete report.\nUpon request by any Member State in which the performance study is being conducted, the sponsor shall provide all information referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   The sponsor shall also report to the Member States in which the performance study is being conducted any event referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article that occurred in third countries in which a performance study is performed under the same clinical performance study plan as the one applying to a performance study covered by this Regulation by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69.\n4.   In the case of a performance study for which the sponsor has used the single application referred to in Article 74, the sponsor shall report any event as referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69. Upon receipt, this report shall be transmitted electronically to all Member States in which the performance study is being conducted.\nUnder the direction of the coordinating Member State referred to in Article 74(2), the Member States shall coordinate their assessment of serious adverse events and device deficiencies to determine whether to modify, suspend or terminate the performance study or whether to revoke the authorisation for that performance study.\nThis paragraph shall not affect the rights of the other Member States to perform their own evaluation and to adopt measures in accordance with this Regulation in order to ensure the protection of public health and patient safety. The coordinating Member State and the Commission shall be kept informed of the outcome of any such evaluation and the adoption of any such measures.\n5.   In the case of PMPF studies referred to in Article 70(1), the provisions on vigilance laid down in Articles 82 to 85 and in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 86 shall apply instead of this Article.\n6.   Notwithstanding paragraph 5, this Article shall apply where a causal relationship between the serious adverse event and the preceding performance study has been established.\nArticle 77\nImplementing acts\nThe Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish the detailed arrangements and procedural aspects necessary for the implementation of this Chapter, as regards the following:\n(a)\nharmonised electronic forms for the application for performance studies and their assessment as referred to in Articles 66 and 74, taking into account specific categories or groups of devices;\n(b)\nthe functioning of the electronic system referred to in Article 69;\n(c)\nharmonised electronic forms for the notification of PMPF studies as referred to in Article 70(1), and of substantial modifications as referred to in Article 71;\n(d)\nthe exchange of information between Member States as referred to in Article 72;\n(e)\nharmonised electronic forms for the reporting of serious adverse events and device deficiencies as referred to in Article 76;\n(f)\nthe timelines for the reporting of serious adverse events and device deficiencies, taking into account the severity of the event to be reported as referred to in Article 76;\n(g)\nuniform application of the requirements regarding the clinical evidence/data needed to demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I.\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3).\nCHAPTER VII\nPOST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE, VIGILANCE AND MARKET SURVEILLANCE\nSection 1\nPost-market surveillance\nArticle 78\nPost-market surveillance system of the manufacturer\n1.   For each device manufacturers shall plan, establish, document, implement, maintain and update a post-market surveillance system in a manner that is proportionate to the risk class and appropriate for the type of device. That system shall be an integral part of the manufacturer's quality management system referred to in Article 10(8).\n2.   The post-market surveillance system shall be suited to actively and systematically gathering, recording and analysing relevant data on the quality, performance and safety of a device throughout its entire lifetime, and to drawing the necessary conclusions and to determining, implementing and monitoring any preventive and corrective actions.\n3.   Data gathered by the manufacturer's post-market surveillance system shall in particular be used:\n(a)\nto update the benefit-risk determination and to improve the risk management as referred to in Chapter I of Annex I;\n(b)\nto update the design and manufacturing information, the instructions for use and the labelling;\n(c)\nto update the performance evaluation;\n(d)\nto update the summary of safety and performance referred to in Article 29;\n(e)\nfor the identification of needs for preventive, corrective or field safety corrective action;\n(f)\nfor the identification of options to improve the usability, performance and safety of the device;\n(g)\nwhen relevant, to contribute to the post-market surveillance of other devices; and\n(h)\nto detect and report trends in accordance with Article 83.\nThe technical documentation shall be updated accordingly.\n4.   If, in the course of the post-market surveillance, a need for preventive or corrective action or both is identified, the manufacturer shall implement the appropriate measures and inform the competent authorities concerned and, where applicable, the notified body. Where a serious incident is identified or a field safety corrective action is implemented, it shall be reported in accordance with Article 82.\nArticle 79\nPost-market surveillance plan\nThe post-market surveillance system referred to in Article 78 shall be based on a post-market surveillance plan, the requirements for which are set out in Section 1 of Annex III. The post-market surveillance plan shall be part of the technical documentation specified in Annex II.\nArticle 80\nPost-market surveillance report\nManufacturers of class A and B devices shall prepare a post-market surveillance report summarising the results and conclusions of the analyses of the post-market surveillance data gathered as a result of the post-market surveillance plan referred to in Article 79 together with a rationale and description of any preventive and corrective actions taken. The report shall be updated when necessary and made available to the notified body and the competent authority upon request.\nArticle 81\nPeriodic safety update report\n1.   Manufacturers of class C and class D devices shall prepare a periodic safety update report (‘PSUR’) for each device and where relevant for each category or group of devices summarising the results and conclusions of the analyses of the post-market surveillance data gathered as a result of the post-market surveillance plan referred to in Article 79 together with a rationale and description of any preventive and corrective actions taken. Throughout the lifetime of the device concerned, that PSUR shall set out:\n(a)\nthe conclusions of the benefit-risk determination;\n(b)\nthe main findings of the PMPF; and\n(c)\nthe volume of sales of the device and an estimate of the size and other characteristics of the population using the device and, where practicable, the usage frequency of the device.\nManufacturers of class C and D devices shall update the PSUR at least annually. That PSUR shall be part of the technical documentation as specified in Annexes II and III.\n2.   Manufacturers of class D devices shall submit PSUR by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 87 to the notified body involved in the conformity assessment of such devices in accordance with Article 48. The notified body shall review the report and add its evaluation to that electronic system with details of any action taken. Such PSUR and the evaluation by the notified body shall be made available to competent authorities through that electronic system.\n3.   For class C devices, manufacturers shall make PSURs available to the notified body involved in the conformity assessment and, upon request, to competent authorities.\nSection 2\nVigilance\nArticle 82\nReporting of serious incidents and field safety corrective actions\n1.   Manufacturers of devices, made available on the Union market, other than devices for performance study, shall report, to the relevant competent authorities, in accordance with Articles 87(5) and (7), the following:\n(a)\nany serious incident involving devices made available on the Union market, except expected erroneous results which are clearly documented and quantified in the product information and in the technical documentation and are subject to trend reporting pursuant to Article 83;\n(b)\nany field safety corrective action in respect of devices made available on the Union market, including any field safety corrective action undertaken in a third country in relation to a device which is also legally made available on the Union market, if the reason for the field safety corrective action is not limited to the device made available in the third country.\nThe reports referred to in the first subparagraph shall be submitted through the electronic system referred to in Article 87.\n2.   As a general rule, the period for the reporting referred to in paragraph 1 shall take account of the severity of the serious incident.\n3.   Manufacturers shall report any serious incident as referred to in point (a) immediately after they have established a causal relationship between that incident and their device or that such causal relationship is reasonably possible, and not later than 15 days after they become aware of the incident.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, in the event of a serious public health threat the report referred to in paragraph 1 shall be provided immediately, and not later than 2 days after the manufacturer becomes aware of that threat.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, in the event of death or an unanticipated serious deterioration in a person's state of health the report shall be provided immediately after the manufacturer has established or as soon as it suspects a causal relationship between the device and the serious incident but not later than 10 days after the date on which the manufacturer becomes aware of the serious incident.\n6.   Where necessary to ensure timely reporting, the manufacturer may submit an initial report that is incomplete followed up by a complete report.\n7.   If, after becoming aware of a potentially reportable incident, the manufacturer is uncertain about whether the incident is reportable, it shall nevertheless submit a report within the timeframe required in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5.\n8.   Except in cases of urgency in which the manufacturer needs to undertake field safety corrective action immediately, the manufacturer shall, without undue delay, report the field safety corrective action referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1, in advance of the field safety corrective action being undertaken.\n9.   For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a field safety corrective action implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, the manufacturer may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports, on condition that the coordinating competent authority referred to in Article 84(9), in consultation with the competent authorities referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 87(8), has agreed with the manufacturer on the format, content and frequency of the periodic summary reporting. Where a single competent authority is referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 87(8), the manufacturer may provide periodic summary reports following agreement with that competent authority.\n10.   The Member States shall take appropriate measures such as organising targeted information campaigns, to encourage and enable healthcare professionals, users and patients to report to the competent authorities suspected serious incidents referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1.\nThe competent authorities shall record centrally at national level reports they receive from healthcare professionals, users and patients.\n11.   Where a competent authority of a Member State obtains such reports on suspected serious incidents referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 from healthcare professionals, users or patients, it shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the manufacturer of the device concerned is informed of the suspected serious incident without delay.\nWhere the manufacturer of the device concerned considers that the incident is a serious incident, it shall provide a report in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article on that serious incident to the competent authority of the Member State in which that serious incident occurred and shall take the appropriate follow-up action in accordance with Article 84.\nWhere the manufacturer of the device concerned considers that the incident is not a serious incident or is to be treated as an increase in expected erroneous results, which will be covered by trend reporting in accordance with to Article 83, it shall provide an explanatory statement. If the competent authority does not agree with the conclusion of the explanatory statement, it may require the manufacturer to provide a report in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article and require it to ensure that appropriate follow-up action is taken in accordance with Article 84.\nArticle 83\nTrend reporting\n1.   Manufacturers shall report by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 87 any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of incidents that are not serious incidents that could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk analysis referred to in Sections 1 and 5 of Annex I and which have led or may lead to unacceptable risks to the health or safety of patients, users or other persons or of any significant increase in expected erroneous results established in comparison to the stated performance of the device as referred to in points (a) and (b) of Section 9.1 of Annex I and specified in the technical documentation and product information.\nThe manufacturer shall specify how to manage the incidents referred to in the first subparagraph and the methodology used for determining any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of such events or change in performance, as well as the observation period, in the post-market surveillance plan referred to in Article 79.\n2.   The competent authorities may conduct their own assessments on the trend reports referred to in paragraph 1 and require the manufacturer to adopt appropriate measures in accordance with this Regulation in order to ensure the protection of public health and patient safety. Each competent authority shall inform the Commission, the other competent authorities and the notified body that issued the certificate, of the results of such assessment and of the adoption of such measures.\nArticle 84\nAnalysis of serious incidents and field safety corrective actions\n1.   Following the reporting of a serious incident pursuant to Article 82(1), the manufacturer shall, without delay, perform the necessary investigations in relation to the serious incident and the devices concerned. This shall include risk assessment of the incident and field safety corrective action taking into account the criteria as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article as appropriate.\nThe manufacturer shall co-operate with the competent authorities and where relevant with the notified body concerned during the investigations referred to in the first subparagraph and shall not perform any investigation which involves altering the device or a sample of the batch concerned in a way which may affect any subsequent evaluation of the causes of the incident, prior to informing the competent authorities of such action.\n2.   Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that any information regarding a serious incident that has occurred within their territory, or a field safety corrective action that has been or is to be undertaken within their territory, and that is brought to their knowledge in accordance with Article 82 is evaluated centrally at national level by their competent authority, if possible together with the manufacturer, and, where relevant, the notified body concerned.\n3.   In the context of the evaluation referred to in paragraph 2, the competent authority shall evaluate the risks arising from the reported serious incident and evaluate any field safety corrective actions, taking into account the protection of public health and criteria such as causality, detectability and probability of recurrence of the problem, frequency of use of the device, probability of occurrence of direct or indirect harm, the severity of that harm, the clinical benefit of the device, intended and potential users, and the population affected. The competent authority shall also evaluate the adequacy of the field safety corrective action envisaged or undertaken by the manufacturer and the need for, and kind of, any other corrective action, in particular taking into account the principle of inherent safety contained in Annex I.\nUpon request by the national competent authority, manufacturers shall provide for all documents necessary for the risk assessment.\n4.   The competent authority shall monitor the manufacturer's investigation of a serious incident. Where necessary, a competent authority may intervene in a manufacturer's investigation or initiate an independent investigation.\n5.   The manufacturer shall provide a final report to the competent authority setting out its findings from the investigation by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 87. The report shall set out conclusions and where relevant indicate corrective actions to be taken.\n6.   In the case of companion diagnostic, the evaluating competent authority or the coordinating competent authority referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article shall, depending on whether the relevant competent authority of the Member State that authorised the medicinal products or the EMA was consulted by the notified body in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 5.2 of Annex IX and Section 3.11 of Annex X, inform that national competent authority or the EMA, as appropriate.\n7.   After carrying out the evaluation in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, the evaluating competent authority shall, through the electronic system referred to in Article 87, inform without delay the other competent authorities of the corrective action taken or envisaged by the manufacturer or required of it to minimise the risk of recurrence of the serious incident, including information on the underlying serious incidents and the outcome of its assessment.\n8.   The manufacturer shall ensure that information about the field safety corrective action taken is brought without delay to the attention of users of the device in question by means of a field safety notice. The field safety notice shall be edited in an official Union language or languages determined by the Member State in which the field safety corrective action is taken. Except in cases of urgency, the content of the draft field safety notice shall be submitted to the evaluating competent authority or, in the cases referred to in paragraph 9, to the coordinating competent authority to allow them to make comments. Unless duly justified by the situation of the individual Member State, the content of the field safety notice shall be consistent in all Member States.\nThe field safety notice shall allow the correct identification of the device or devices involved, in particular by including the relevant UDIs, and the correct identification, in particular by including the SRN, if already issued, of the manufacturer that has undertaken the field safety corrective action. The field safety notice shall explain, in a clear manner, without understating the level of risk, the reasons for the field safety corrective action with reference to the device malfunction and associated risks for patients, users or other persons and shall clearly indicate all the actions to be taken by users.\nThe manufacturer shall enter the field safety notice in the electronic system referred to in Article 87 through which that notice shall be accessible to the public.\n9.   The competent authorities shall actively participate in a procedure in order to coordinate their assessments referred to in paragraph 3 in the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere there is concern regarding a particular serious incident or cluster of serious incidents relating to the same device or type of device of the same manufacturer in more than one Member State;\n(b)\nwhere the appropriateness of a field safety corrective action that is proposed by a manufacturer in more than one Member State is in question.\nThat coordinated procedure shall cover the following:\n—\ndesignation of a coordinating competent authority on a case by case basis, when required;\n—\ndefining the coordinated assessment process, including the tasks and responsibilities of the coordinating competent authority and the involvement of other competent authorities.\nUnless otherwise agreed between the competent authorities, the coordinating competent authority shall be the competent authority of the Member State in which the manufacturer has its registered place of business.\nThe coordinating competent authority shall, through the electronic system referred to in Article 87, inform the manufacturer, the other competent authorities and the Commission that it has assumed the role of coordinating authority.\n10.   The designation of a coordinating competent authority shall not affect the rights of the other competent authorities to perform their own assessment and to adopt measures in accordance with this Regulation in order to ensure the protection of public health and patient safety. The coordinating competent authority and the Commission shall be kept informed of the outcome of any such assessment and the adoption of any such measures.\n11.   The Commission shall provide administrative support to the coordinating competent authority in the accomplishment of its tasks under this Chapter.\nArticle 85\nAnalysis of vigilance data\nThe Commission shall, in collaboration with the Member States, put in place systems and processes to actively monitor the data available in the electronic system referred to in Article 87, in order to identify trends, patterns or signals in the data that may reveal new risks or safety concerns.\nWhere a previously unknown risk is identified or the frequency of an anticipated risk significantly and adversely changes the benefit-risk determination, the competent authority or, where appropriate, the coordinating competent authority shall inform the manufacturer, or where applicable the authorised representative, which shall then take the necessary corrective actions.\nArticle 86\nImplementing acts\nThe Commission may, by means of implementing acts, and after consultation of the MDCG, adopt the detailed arrangements and procedural aspects necessary for the implementation of Articles 80 to 85 and 87 as regards the following:\n(a)\nthe typology of serious incidents and field safety corrective actions in relation to specific devices, or categories or groups of devices;\n(b)\nthe reporting of serious incidents and field safety corrective actions and field safety notices, and the provision of periodic summary reports, post-market surveillance reports, PSURs and trend reports by manufacturers as referred to in Articles 80, 81, 82, 83 and 84 respectively;\n(c)\nstandard structured forms for electronic and non-electronic reporting, including a minimum data set for reporting of suspected serious incidents by healthcare professionals, users and patients;\n(d)\ntimelines for the reporting of field safety corrective actions, and for the provision by manufacturers of periodic summary reports and trend reports, taking into account the severity of the incident to be reported as referred to in Article 82;\n(e)\nharmonised forms for the exchange of information between competent authorities as referred to in Article 84;\n(f)\nprocedures for the designation of a coordinating competent authority; the coordinated evaluation process, including tasks and responsibilities of the coordinating competent authority and involvement of other competent authorities in this process.\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3).\nArticle 87\nElectronic system on vigilance and post-market surveillance\n1.

Definitions\nAutomatic identification and data capture (‘AIDC’)\nAIDC is a technology used to automatically capture data. AIDC technologies include bar codes, smart cards, biometrics and RFID.\nBasic UDI-DI\nThe Basic UDI-DI is the primary identifier of a device model. It is the DI assigned at the level of the device unit of use. It is the main key for records in the UDI database and is referenced in relevant certificates and EU declarations of conformity.\nUnit of Use DI\nThe Unit of Use DI serves to associate the use of a device with a patient in instances in which a UDI is not labelled on the individual device at the level of its unit of use, for example in the event of several units of the same device being packaged together.\nConfigurable device\nA configurable device is a device that consists of several components which can be assembled by the manufacturer in multiple configurations. Those individual components may be devices in themselves.\nConfiguration\nConfiguration is a combination of items of equipment, as specified by the manufacturer, that operate together as a device to achieve an intended purpose. The combination of items may be modified, adjusted or customised to meet specific needs.\nUDI-DI\nThe UDI-DI is a unique numeric or alphanumeric code specific to a model of device and that is also used as the ‘access key’ to information stored in a UDI database.\nHuman Readable Interpretation (HRI)\nHRI is a legible interpretation of the data characters encoded in the UDI carrier.\nPackaging levels\nPackaging levels means the various levels of device packaging that contain a fixed quantity of devices, such as a carton or case.\nProduction Identifier (UDI-PI)\nThe UDI-PI is a numeric or alphanumeric code that identifies the unit of device production.\nThe different types of UDI-PI(s) include serial number, lot number, software identification and manufacturing or expiry date or both types of date.\nRadio Frequency Identification (‘RFID’)\nRFID is a technology that uses communication through the use of radio waves to exchange data between a reader and an electronic tag attached to an object, for the purpose of identification.\nShipping containers\nA shipping container is a container in relation to which traceability is controlled by a process specific to logistics systems.\nUnique Device Identifier (‘UDI’)\nThe UDI is a series of numeric or alphanumeric characters that is created through a globally accepted device identification and coding standard. It allows the unambiguous identification of a specific device on the market. The UDI is comprised of the UDI-DI and the UDI-PI.\nThe word ‘Unique’ does not imply serialisation of individual production units.\nUDI carrier\nThe UDI carrier is the means of conveying the UDI by using AIDC and, if applicable, its HRI.\nUDI carriers include, inter alia, ID/linear bar code, 2D/Matrix bar code, RFID.\n2.   General requirements\n2.1.   The affixing of the UDI is an additional requirement — it does not replace any other marking or labelling requirements laid down in Annex I to this Regulation.\n2.2.   The manufacturer shall assign and maintain unique UDIs for its devices.\n2.3.   Only the manufacturer may place the UDI on the device or its packaging.\n2.4.   Only coding standards provided by issuing entities designated by the Commission pursuant to Article 24(2) may be used.\n3.   The UDI\n3.1.   A UDI shall be assigned to the device itself or its packaging. Higher levels of packaging shall have their own UDI.\n3.2.   Shipping containers shall be exempted from the requirement in Section 3.1. By way of example, a UDI shall not be required on a logistics unit; where a healthcare provider orders multiple devices using the UDI or model number of individual devices and the manufacturer places those devices in a container for shipping or to protect the individually packaged devices, the container (logistics unit) shall not be subject to UDI requirements.\n3.3.   The UDI shall contain two parts: a UDI-DI and a UDI-PI.\n3.4.   The UDI-DI shall be unique at each level of device packaging.\n3.5.   If a lot number, serial number, software identification or expiry date appears on the label, it shall be part of the UDI-PI. If there is also a manufacturing date on the label, it does not need to be included in the UDI-PI. If there is only a manufacturing date on the label, this shall be used as the UDI-PI.\n3.6.   Each component that is considered to be a device and is commercially available on its own shall be assigned a separate UDI unless the components are part of a configurable device that is marked with its own UDI.\n3.7.   Kits shall be assigned and bear their own UDI.\n3.8.   The manufacturer shall assign the UDI to a device following the relevant coding standard.\n3.9.   A new UDI-DI shall be required whenever there is a change that could lead to misidentification of the device and/or ambiguity in its traceability. In particular, any change of one of the following UDI database data elements shall require a new UDI-DI:\n(a)\nName or trade name,\n(b)\ndevice version or model,\n(c)\nlabelled as single use,\n(d)\npackaged sterile,\n(e)\nneed for sterilization before use,\n(f)\nquantity of devices provided in a package,\n(g)\ncritical warnings or contra-indications.\n3.10.   Manufacturers that repackage or relabel devices with their own label shall retain a record of the original device manufacturer's UDI.\n4.   UDI carrier\n4.1.   The UDI carrier (AIDC and HRI representation of the UDI) shall be placed on the label and on all higher levels of device packaging. Higher levels do not include shipping containers.\n4.2.   In the event of there being significant space constraints on the unit of use packaging the UDI carrier may be placed on the next higher packaging level.\n4.3.   For single use class A and class B devices packaged and labelled individually, the UDI carrier shall not be required to appear on the packaging but it shall appear on a higher level of packaging e.g. a carton containing several packages. However, when the healthcare provider is not expected to have access, in cases such as in home healthcare settings, to the higher level of device packaging, the UDI shall be placed on the packaging.\n4.4.   For devices exclusively intended for retail point of sale, the UDI-PIs in AIDC shall not be required to appear on the point of sale packaging.\n4.5.   When AIDC carriers other than the UDI carrier are part of the product labelling, the UDI carrier shall be readily identifiable.\n4.6.   If linear bar codes are used, the UDI-DI and UDI-PI may be concatenated or non-concatenated in two or more bar codes. All parts and elements of the linear bar code shall be distinguishable and identifiable.\n4.7.   If there are significant constraints limiting the use of both AIDC and HRI on the label, only the AIDC format shall be required to appear on the label. For devices intended to be used outside healthcare facilities, such as devices for home care, the HRI shall however appear on the label even if this results in there being no space for the AIDC.\n4.8.   The HRI format shall follow the rules of the UDI code-issuing entity.\n4.9.   If the manufacturer is using RFID technology, a linear or 2D bar code in line with the standard provided by the issuing entities shall also be provided on the label.\n4.10.   Devices that are reusable shall bear a UDI carrier on the device itself. The UDI carrier for reusable devices that require disinfection, sterilisation or refurbishing between patient uses shall be permanent and readable after each process performed to make the device ready for the subsequent use throughout the intended lifetime of the device.\n4.11.   The UDI carrier shall be readable during normal use and throughout the intended lifetime of the device.\n4.12.   If the UDI carrier is readily readable or scannable through the device's packaging, the placing of the UDI carrier on the packaging shall not be required.\n4.13.   In the case of single finished devices made up of multiple parts that must be assembled before first use, it shall be sufficient to place the UDI carrier on only one part of each device.\n4.14.   The UDI carrier shall be placed in a manner such that the AIDC can be accessed during normal operation or storage.\n4.15.   Bar code carriers that include both a UDI-DI and a UDI-PI may also include essential data for the device to operate or other data.\n5.   General principles of the UDI database\n5.1.   The UDI database shall support the use of all core UDI database data elements referred to in Part B of this Annex.\n5.2.   Manufacturers shall be responsible for the initial submission and updates of the identifying information and other device data elements in the UDI database.\n5.3.   Appropriate methods/procedures for validation of the data provided shall be implemented.\n5.4.   Manufacturers shall periodically verify the correctness of all of the data relevant to devices they have placed on the market, except for devices that are no longer available on the market.\n5.5.   The presence of the device UDI-DI in the UDI database shall not be assumed to mean that the device is in conformity with this Regulation.\n5.6.   The database shall allow for the linking of all the packaging levels of the device.\n5.7.   The data for new UDI-DIs shall be available at the time the device is placed on the market.\n5.8.   Manufacturers shall update the relevant UDI database record within 30 days of a change being made to an element, which does not require a new UDI-DI.\n5.9.   Internationally accepted standards for data submission and updates shall, wherever possible, be used by the UDI database.\n5.10.   The user interface of the UDI database shall be available in all official languages of the Union. The use of free-text fields shall, however, be minimised in order to reduce translations.\n5.11.   Data relating to devices that are no longer available on the market shall be retained in the UDI database.\n6.   Rules for specific device types\n6.1.   Reusable devices that are part of kits and that require cleaning, disinfection, sterilisation or refurbishing between uses\n6.1.1.   The UDI of such devices shall be placed on the device and shall be readable after each procedure to make the device ready for the next use;\n6.1.2.   The UDI-PI characteristics such as the lot or serial number shall be defined by the manufacturer.\n6.2.   Device software\n6.2.1.   UDI assignment Criteria\nThe UDI shall be assigned at the system level of the software. Only software which is commercially available on its own and software which constitutes a device in itself shall be subject to that requirement.\nThe software identification shall be considered to be the manufacturing control mechanism and shall be displayed in the UDI-PI.\n6.2.2.   A new UDI-DI shall be required whenever there is a modification that changes:\n(a)\nthe original performance,\n(b)\nthe safety or the intended use of the software.\n(c)\ninterpretation of data.\nSuch modifications include new or modified algorithms, database structures, operating platform, architecture or new user interfaces or new channels for interoperability.\n6.2.3.   Minor software revisions shall require a new UDI-PI and not a new UDI-DI:\nMinor software revisions are generally associated with bug fixes, usability enhancements that are not for safety purposes, security patches or operating efficiency.\nMinor software revisions shall be identified by a manufacturer-specific form of identification.\n6.2.4.   UDI placement criteria for software\n(a)\nwhere the software is delivered on a physical medium, for example via a CD or DVD, each packaging level shall bear the human readable and AIDC representation of the complete UDI. The UDI that is applied to the physical medium containing the software and its packaging shall be identical to the UDI assigned to the system level software;\n(b)\nthe UDI shall be provided on a readily accessible screen for the user in an easily-readable plain-text format such as an ‘about’ file, or included on the start-up screen;\n(c)\nsoftware lacking a user interface such as middleware for image conversion, shall be capable of transmitting the UDI through an application programming interface (API);\n(d)\nonly the human readable portion of the UDI shall be required in electronic displays of the software. The marking of UDI using AIDC shall not be required in the electronic displays such as ‘about’ menu, splash screen, etc.;\n(e)\nthe human readable format of the UDI for the software shall include the application identifiers (AI) for the standard used by the issuing entities, so as to assist the user in identifying the UDI and determining which standard is being used to create the UDI.\nANNEX VII\nREQUIREMENTS TO BE MET BY NOTIFIED BODIES\n1.

However, devices manufactured and used in the same healthcare centre are exempted from the rules laid down by this regulation, other than the relevant general safety and performance requirements, so long as a number of conditions are fulfilled.\nClassification system\nThe classification system for IVD medical devices has been adapted to the rapid scientific progress in the field and to the international guidance. They are classified according to their intended purpose and their inherent risks (classes A, B, C and D — for more details, see the regulation’s Annex VIII).\nNotified bodies\nThe regulation tightens the rules concerning how the independent notified bodies — which assess the conformity of medium- and high-risk medical devices before they are placed on the market — are designated, organised and monitored.\nThese bodies have to meet the same high-quality standards throughout the EU and must have the required staff to successfully perform their conformity assessment tasks.\nOn-site inspections of manufacturers, of which some are unannounced, must be carried out.\nClinical data\nThe regulation specifies what is required in the data collection of performance studies on IVD medical devices. These have been aligned with those applicable for clinical trials on medicinal products. These include rules on informed consent and protecting vulnerable subjects (e.g. people under the age of 18, pregnant women or the incapacitated).\nPerformance studies conducted in more than one EU country will be subject to a coordinated assessment.\nManufacturers’ obligations\nManufacturers have clearer and more stringent obligations to monitor the quality, performance and safety of devices.\nThey are required to have measures in place that correspond to the level of risk, type of device and size of company. They must ensure they have sufficient financial coverage with respect to their potential liability under the product liability directive as well as quality management and post-market surveillance systems.\nIn the event of damages due to defective devices, a manufacturer’s authorised representative is jointly and severally liable.\nTraceability\nThe regulation introduces a system for registering devices and manufacturers, importers and authorised representatives to ensure the traceability of devices throughout the supply chain by means of a unique device identification system. This will ensure that, should problems arise, measures can be taken rapidly.\nHigh-risk devices\nIn the event of the first certification for class D IVD devices, and when common specifications are not available, designated reference laboratories will check the performance claimed by their manufacturers and an expert panel will be consulted on innovative devices of the same class. Although the notified body is not bound by the panel’s opinion, it has to provide a justification for not following it. Nevertheless, the notified body shall not deliver this first certificate if the scientific opinion of the EU reference laboratory is negative.\nGenetic counselling\nPatients tested with a genetic test must be provided with all relevant information on its nature, significance and implications. They must be given appropriate access to counselling in cases where a test provides information on the genetic predisposition for medical conditions and/or diseases which are generally considered to be untreatable.\nIncident reporting\nIn addition to the obligation for manufacturers to report serious incidents (resulting in death or a serious deterioration in a person’s health) and trends in non-serious incidents (for example, side-effects from the use of a device), the regulation introduces the obligation for EU countries to encourage and enable healthcare professionals, users and patients to report suspected incidents at national level.\nMarket surveillance\nCompetent EU authorities are responsible for ensuring that any unsafe device is withdrawn from the market.\nEudamed\nA centralised database, called the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed) will be developed to provide EU countries, businesses, patients, healthcare professionals and the public with information on medical devices available in the EU.\nRepeal of existing legislation — Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU\nThe regulation repeals Directive 98/79/EC and Decision 2010/227/EU from 26 May 2022, with some exceptions laid down in Article 112.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt entered into force on 25 May 2017 and applies from 26 May 2022. Dates of application for some of the regulation’s articles vary and are detailed in Articles 110 and 113.\nBACKGROUND\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis regulation is one of 2 adopted by the EU to overhaul its laws on medical devices. The second regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) concerns medical devices.\nFor more information, see:\nMedical devices (European Commission).Following the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:Communication from the Commission — Guidelines on COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and their performance\tKEY TERMS\nIn vitro diagnostic medical devices: term covering a wide variety of devices used for providing information on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(a) a physiological or pathological process or state;\n(b) a congenital physical or mental impairment;\n(c) the predisposition to a medical condition or disease;\n(d) the safety and compatibility between the materials used and the specimens of the body intended to be used;\n(e) treatment response or reactions;\n(f) defining or monitoring therapeutic measures.\nExamples range from self-tests for pregnancy through to tests for highly transmissible substances using specimens taken from the human body.\nPerformance studies: studies that demonstrate that an IVD medical device complies with the necessary regulatory requirements through conformity assessment procedures.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRegulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, pp. 176-332)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRegulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, pp. 1-175)\nCommission Decision 2010/227/EU of 19 April 2010 on the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed) (OJ L 102, 23.4.2010, pp. 45-48)\nDirective 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (OJ L 331, 7.12.1998, pp. 1-37)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 98/79/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
