In the framework of its wider international obligations, the Union participates in efforts made in international waters to conserve fish stocks.\n(3)\nBy means of Council Decision 2006/539/EC (6), the Union approved the Convention for the Strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission established by the 1949 Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica (‘the Convention’).\n(4)\nThe Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) has the authority to adopt decisions (‘Resolutions’) to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources in the Convention area. Resolutions are binding for the Contracting Parties. Resolutions are essentially addressed to the Contracting Parties to the Convention, but also contain obligations for private operators (e.g. masters of vessels). Resolutions enter into force 45 days following their adoption and, in respect of the Union, they must be implemented into Union law as soon as possible.\n(5)\nBy means of Council Decision 2005/938/EC (7), the Union approved the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (‘the Agreement’), which established the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (IDCP).\n(6)\nUnder Article XIV of the Agreement, the IATTC is to have an integral role in coordinating the implementation of the Agreement and in implementing the measures that will be adopted within the framework of the IATTC.\n(7)\nWithin the IDCP, the Meeting of the Parties is responsible for the adoption of measures designed to progressively reduce incidental dolphin mortality in the tuna purse seine fishery in the Agreement Area to levels approaching zero, through the setting of annual limits. Such measures become binding upon the Union.\n(8)\nThe most recent implementation of the Resolutions was carried out through Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 (8).\n(9)\nTaking into consideration that Resolutions are likely to be amended at the annual meetings of the IATTC, and in order to swiftly incorporate them into Union law, to reinforce the level playing field and further support the long-term sustainable management of the stocks, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the following aspects: the technical specifications for shark lines, closure periods, fish-aggregating devices (FADs) reporting timelines, provisions concerning design and deployment of FADs, data collection deadlines, areas and mitigation measures for the protection of seabirds, scientific observer coverage, information related to the Regional Vessel Register, reference to table for provision of data for the logbooks and unloading records, the bigeye tuna statistical document, several reporting deadlines and the turtle mortality guidelines. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (9). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(10)\nThe delegation of powers provided for in this Regulation should be without prejudice to the implementation of future Resolutions into Union law through the ordinary legislative procedure.\n(11)\nSince this Regulation implements all IATTC measures, Article 3(3), Article 4(3) and Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 should be deleted,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral Provisions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down management, conservation and control measures relating to fishing in the area covered under the Convention and with respect to stocks of tunas and tuna-like species, other species of fish taken by vessels fishing for tunas and tuna-like species and species belonging to the same ecosystem that are affected by fishing for, or dependent on or associated with, the fish stocks covered by the Convention.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Tuna Convention area\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2021/56 laying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention area and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nThe regulation transposes into EU law the management, conservation and control measures adopted by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) concerning stocks of tunas, and other species of fish in the same ecosystem.\nThe Convention covers a defined area of the eastern Pacific Ocean.\nKEY POINTS\nConservation and management\nTime closures: fishing is closed to purse seine* vessels for tropical tunas (bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna) for 2 periods each year. Each EU Member State involved in the fishery stipulates by 15 June which of the two closure periods — from 29 July to 8 October, or from 9 November to 19 January — will apply to their vessels.\nArea closures: fishing for tropical tunas within the area of 96° and 110°W and between 4°N and 3°S is closed from 9 October to 8 November.\nDeploying fishing gear within 1 nautical mile of, or interacting with, an anchored data buoy* in the Convention area is prohibited.\nActive fish-aggregating devices* (FADs) are limited to 450 per purse seine vessel. Member Statesshall report daily information on all active FADs to the European Commission submitted with a time delay of at least 60 days, but with not more than 90 days between each report. Operators of EU fishing vessels must collect and report any interaction with FADs.\nAll transhipments of IATTC species in the Convention area shall take place in port.\nProtecting marine species\nThe following species shall not be retained on board, transhipped, landed, stored, or sold, and must be safely released: oceanic whitetip sharks;mobulid rays (which includes Manta rays and Mobula rays);silky sharks (where caught by purse seine).\nEU fishing vessels shall not set a purse seine net on a school of tunas where a whale shark is present, and incidents should be reported. They shall promptly release sharks (whether alive or dead) as soon as possible without compromising human safety.\nEU longline fishing vessels shall not use shark lines.\nCatch data for silky and hammerhead sharks shall be reported to the IATTC.\nSea turtles shall be promptly released, in a way that causes the least harm and without compromising human safety of any persons. At least one crew member must be trained in techniques for handling and release of sea turtles to improve survival after release.\nThere are also measures aimed at protecting seabirds (restrictions on using longlines), and dolphins (authorised vessels only, and restrictions on using purse seines when fishing for yellowfin tunas).\nScientific observers on long-liners\nMember States must ensure that longline vessels carry a scientific observer on board, to cover at least 5% of the fishing effort made by vessels longer than 20 metres, who records catches of targeted fish species, species composition and any other available biological information as well as any interactions with non-target species such as sea turtles, seabirds and sharks. The regulation includes detailed rules to assure observer safety.\nVessel requirements\nMember States shall provide detailed information on each fishing vessel under their jurisdiction fishing in the Convention area for the IATTC Regional Vessel Register.\nA well (as space on board a vessel to carry live fish) that is sealed must be physically sealed in a tamper-proof manner so that it is not connected with any other space on the vessel and cannot be used for any other storage. Observers must report to the IATTC any instances of sealed wells being used for storing fish.\nCatch data\nCatch data must be reported by Member States to the Commission annually for species covered by the Convention, with special rules for reporting on bigeye tuna caught by purse seiners and bait boats.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 15 February 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe EU concluded the Convention in 2006 as a contracting party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (see summary).\nSee also:\nRegional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPurse seine: any encircling net, the bottom of which is drawn together by a purse line at the bottom of the net, which passes through a series of rings along the ground rope, enabling the net to be pursed and closed.\nData buoys: floating devices, either drifting or anchored, that are deployed by governmental or recognised scientific organisations or entities to electronically collect environmental data, not in support of fishing activities, and which have been notified to the IATTC Secretariat.\nFish-aggregating device (FAD): anchored, drifting, floating or submerged objects deployed or tracked by vessels, including through the use of radio or satellite buoys, for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purse seine fishing operations.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2021/56 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 January 2021 laying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention area and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 (OJ L 24, 26.1.2021, pp. 1-18)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Union control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 (OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, pp. 1-50)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
