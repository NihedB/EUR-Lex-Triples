{"celex_id": "32007R1393", "reference": "10.12.2007\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 324/79\nREGULATION (EC) No 1393/2007 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 November 2007\non the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c) and Article 67(5), second indent, thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured. To establish such an area, the Community is to adopt, among others, the measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters needed for the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(2)\nThe proper functioning of the internal market entails the need to improve and expedite the transmission of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters for service between the Member States.\n(3)\nThe Council, by an Act dated 26 May 1997 (3), drew up a Convention on the service in the Member States of the European Union of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters and recommended it for adoption by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional rules. That Convention has not entered into force. Continuity in the results of the negotiations for conclusion of the Convention should be ensured.\n(4)\nOn 29 May 2000 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (4). The main content of that Regulation is based on the Convention.\n(5)\nOn 1 October 2004 the Commission adopted a report on the application of Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000. The report concludes that the application of Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 has generally improved and expedited the transmission and the service of documents between Member States since its entry into force in 2001, but that nevertheless the application of certain provisions is not fully satisfactory.\n(6)\nEfficiency and speed in judicial procedures in civil matters require that judicial and extrajudicial documents be transmitted directly and by rapid means between local bodies designated by the Member States. Member States may indicate their intention to designate only one transmitting or receiving agency or one agency to perform both functions, for a period of five years. This designation may, however, be renewed every five years.\n(7)\nSpeed in transmission warrants the use of all appropriate means, provided that certain conditions as to the legibility and reliability of the document received are observed. Security in transmission requires that the document to be transmitted be accompanied by a standard form, to be completed in the official language or one of the official languages of the place where service is to be effected, or in another language accepted by the Member State in question.\n(8)\nThis Regulation should not apply to service of a document on the partyâ€™s authorised representative in the Member State where the proceedings are taking place regardless of the place of residence of that party.\n(9)\nThe service of a document should be effected as soon as possible, and in any event within one month of receipt by the receiving agency.\n(10)\nTo secure the effectiveness of this Regulation, the possibility of refusing service of documents should be confined to exceptional situations.\n(11)\nIn order to facilitate the transmission and service of documents between Member States, the standard forms set out in the Annexes to this Regulation should be used.\n(12)\nThe receiving agency should inform the addressee in writing using the standard form that he may refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within one week if it is not either in a language which he understands or in the official language or one of the official languages of the place of service. This rule should also apply to the subsequent service once the addressee has exercised his right of refusal. These rules on refusal should also apply to service by diplomatic or consular agents, service by postal services and direct service. It should be established that the service of the refused document can be remedied through the service on the addressee of a translation of the document.\n(13)\nSpeed in transmission warrants documents being served within days of receipt of the document. However, if service has not been effected after one month has elapsed, the receiving agency should inform the transmitting agency. The expiry of this period should not imply that the request be returned to the transmitting agency where it is clear that service is feasible within a reasonable period.\n(14)\nThe receiving agency should continue to take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document also in cases where it has not been possible to effect service within the month, for example, because the defendant has been away from his home on holiday or away from his office on business. However, in order to avoid an open-ended obligation for the receiving agency to take steps to effect the service of a document, the transmitting agency should be able to specify a time limit in the standard form after which service is no longer required.\n(15)\nGiven the differences between the Member States as regards their rules of procedure, the material date for the purposes of service varies from one Member State to another. Having regard to such situations and the possible difficulties that may arise, this Regulation should provide for a system where it is the law of the Member State addressed which determines the date of service. However, where according to the law of a Member State a document has to be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant should be that determined by the law of that Member State. This double date system exists only in a limited number of Member States. Those Member States which apply this system should communicate this to the Commission, which should publish the information in the Official Journal of the European Union and make it available through the European Judicial Network in Civil and Commercial Matters established by Council Decision 2001/470/EC (5).\n(16)\nIn order to facilitate access to justice, costs occasioned by recourse to a judicial officer or a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed should correspond to a single fixed fee laid down by that Member State in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination. The requirement of a single fixed fee should not preclude the possibility for Member States to set different fees for different types of service as long as they respect these principles.\n(17)\nEach Member State should be free to effect service of documents directly by postal services on persons residing in another Member State by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or equivalent.\n(18)\nIt should be possible for any person interested in a judicial proceeding to effect service of documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the Member State addressed, where such direct service is permitted under the law of that Member State.\n(19)\nThe Commission should draw up a manual containing information relevant for the proper application of this Regulation, which should be made available through the European Judicial Network in Civil and Commercial Matters. The Commission and the Member States should do their utmost to ensure that this information is up to date and complete especially as regards contact details of receiving and transmitting agencies.\n(20)\nIn calculating the periods and time limits provided for in this Regulation, Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits (6) should apply.\n(21)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7).\n(22)\nIn particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to update or make technical amendments to the standard forms set out in the Annexes. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend/delete non-essential elements of this Regulation, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(23)\nThis Regulation prevails over the provisions contained in bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements having the same scope, concluded by the Member States, and in particular the Protocol annexed to the Brussels Convention of 27 September 1968 (8) and the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 (9) in relations between the Member States party thereto. This Regulation does not preclude Member States from maintaining or concluding agreements or arrangements to expedite or simplify the transmission of documents, provided that they are compatible with this Regulation.\n(24)\nThe information transmitted pursuant to this Regulation should enjoy suitable protection. This matter falls within the scope of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (10), and of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (11).\n(25)\nNo later than 1 June 2011 and every five years thereafter, the Commission should review the application of this Regulation and propose such amendments as may appear necessary.\n(26)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(27)\nIn order to make the provisions more easily accessible and readable, Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(28)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom and Ireland are taking part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(29)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

Judicial documents shall be transmitted directly and as soon as possible between the agencies designated pursuant to Article 2.\n2.   The transmission of documents, requests, confirmations, receipts, certificates and any other papers between transmitting agencies and receiving agencies may be carried out by any appropriate means, provided that the content of the document received is true and faithful to that of the document forwarded and that all information in it is easily legible.\n3.   The document to be transmitted shall be accompanied by a request drawn up using the standard form set out in Annex I. The form shall be completed in the official language of the Member State addressed or, if there are several official languages in that Member State, the official language or one of the official languages of the place where service is to be effected, or in another language which that Member State has indicated it can accept. Each Member State shall indicate the official language or languages of the institutions of the European Union other than its own which is or are acceptable to it for completion of the form.\n4.   The documents and all papers that are transmitted shall be exempted from legalisation or any equivalent formality.\n5.   When the transmitting agency wishes a copy of the document to be returned together with the certificate referred to in Article 10, it shall send the document in duplicate.\nArticle 5\nTranslation of documents\n1.   The applicant shall be advised by the transmitting agency to which he forwards the document for transmission that the addressee may refuse to accept it if it is not in one of the languages provided for in Article 8.\n2.   The applicant shall bear any costs of translation prior to the transmission of the document, without prejudice to any possible subsequent decision by the court or competent authority on liability for such costs.\nArticle 6\nReceipt of documents by receiving agency\n1.   On receipt of a document, a receiving agency shall, as soon as possible and in any event within seven days of receipt, send a receipt to the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means of transmission using the standard form set out in Annex I.\n2.   Where the request for service cannot be fulfilled on the basis of the information or documents transmitted, the receiving agency shall contact the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means in order to secure the missing information or documents.\n3.   If the request for service is manifestly outside the scope of this Regulation or if non-compliance with the formal conditions required makes service impossible, the request and the documents transmitted shall be returned, on receipt, to the transmitting agency, together with the notice of return using the standard form set out in Annex I.\n4.   A receiving agency receiving a document for service but not having territorial jurisdiction to serve it shall forward it, as well as the request, to the receiving agency having territorial jurisdiction in the same Member State if the request complies with the conditions laid down in Article 4(3) and shall inform the transmitting agency accordingly using the standard form set out in Annex I.

The receiving agency shall itself serve the document or have it served, either in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed or by a particular method requested by the transmitting agency, unless that method is incompatible with the law of that Member State.\n2.   The receiving agency shall take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document as soon as possible, and in any event within one month of receipt. If it has not been possible to effect service within one month of receipt, the receiving agency shall:\n(a)\nimmediately inform the transmitting agency by means of the certificate in the standard form set out in Annex I, which shall be drawn up under the conditions referred to in Article 10(2); and\n(b)\ncontinue to take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document, unless indicated otherwise by the transmitting agency, where service seems to be possible within a reasonable period of time.\nArticle 8\nRefusal to accept a document\n1.   The receiving agency shall inform the addressee, using the standard form set out in Annex II, that he may refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within one week if it is not written in, or accompanied by a translation into, either of the following languages:\n(a)\na language which the addressee understands;\nor\n(b)\nthe official language of the Member State addressed or, if there are several official languages in that Member State, the official language or one of the official languages of the place where service is to be effected.\n2.   Where the receiving agency is informed that the addressee refuses to accept the document in accordance with paragraph 1, it shall immediately inform the transmitting agency by means of the certificate provided for in Article 10 and return the request and the documents of which a translation is requested.\n3.   If the addressee has refused to accept the document pursuant to paragraph 1, the service of the document can be remedied through the service on the addressee in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation of the document accompanied by a translation into a language provided for in paragraph 1. In that case, the date of service of the document shall be the date on which the document accompanied by the translation is served in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed. However, where according to the law of a Member State, a document has to be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant shall be the date of the service of the initial document determined pursuant to Article 9(2).\n4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to the means of transmission and service of judicial documents provided for in Section 2.\n5.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the diplomatic or consular agents, where service is effected in accordance with Article 13, or the authority or person, where service is effected in accordance with Article 14, shall inform the addressee that he may refuse to accept the document and that any document refused must be sent to those agents or to that authority or person respectively.\nArticle 9\nDate of service\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 8, the date of service of a document pursuant to Article 7 shall be the date on which it is served in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed.\n2.   However, where according to the law of a Member State a document has to be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant shall be that determined by the law of that Member State.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to the means of transmission and service of judicial documents provided for in Section 2.\nArticle 10\nCertificate of service and copy of the document served\n1.

The certificate shall be completed in the official language or one of the official languages of the Member State of origin or in another language which the Member State of origin has indicated that it can accept. Each Member State shall indicate the official language or languages of the institutions of the European Union other than its own which is or are acceptable to it for completion of the form.\nArticle 11\nCosts of service\n1.   The service of judicial documents coming from a Member State shall not give rise to any payment or reimbursement of taxes or costs for services rendered by the Member State addressed.\n2.   However, the applicant shall pay or reimburse the costs occasioned by:\n(a)\nrecourse to a judicial officer or to a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed;\n(b)\nthe use of a particular method of service.\nCosts occasioned by recourse to a judicial officer or to a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed shall correspond to a single fixed fee laid down by that Member State in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination. Member States shall communicate such fixed fees to the Commission.\nSection 2\nOther means of transmission and service of judicial documents\nArticle 12\nTransmission by consular or diplomatic channels\nEach Member State shall be free, in exceptional circumstances, to use consular or diplomatic channels to forward judicial documents, for the purpose of service, to those agencies of another Member State which are designated pursuant to Articles 2 or 3.\nArticle 13\nService by diplomatic or consular agents\n1.

Each Member State may make it known, in accordance with Article 23(1), that the judge, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, may give judgment even if no certificate of service or delivery has been received, if all the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe document was transmitted by one of the methods provided for in this Regulation;\n(b)\na period of time of not less than six months, considered adequate by the judge in the particular case, has elapsed since the date of the transmission of the document;\n(c)\nno certificate of any kind has been received, even though every reasonable effort has been made to obtain it through the competent authorities or bodies of the Member State addressed.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the judge may order, in case of urgency, any provisional or protective measures.\n4.   When a writ of summons or an equivalent document has had to be transmitted to another Member State for the purpose of service under the provisions of this Regulation and a judgment has been entered against a defendant who has not appeared, the judge shall have the power to relieve the defendant from the effects of the expiry of the time for appeal from the judgment if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe defendant, without any fault on his part, did not have knowledge of the document in sufficient time to defend, or knowledge of the judgment in sufficient time to appeal; and\n(b)\nthe defendant has disclosed a prima facie defence to the action on the merits.\nAn application for relief may be filed only within a reasonable time after the defendant has knowledge of the judgment.\nEach Member State may make it known, in accordance with Article 23(1), that such application will not be entertained if it is filed after the expiry of a time to be stated by it in that communication, but which shall in no case be less than one year following the date of the judgment.\n5.

This Regulation shall not preclude individual Member States from maintaining or concluding agreements or arrangements to expedite further or simplify the transmission of documents, provided that they are compatible with this Regulation.\n3.   Member States shall send to the Commission:\n(a)\na copy of the agreements or arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 concluded between the Member States as well as drafts of such agreements or arrangements which they intend to adopt; and\n(b)\nany denunciation of, or amendments to, these agreements or arrangements.\nArticle 21\nLegal aid\nThis Regulation shall not affect the application of Article 23 of the Convention on civil procedure of 17 July 1905, Article 24 of the Convention on civil procedure of 1 March 1954 or Article 13 of the Convention on international access to justice of 25 October 1980 between the Member States party to those Conventions.\nArticle 22\nProtection of information transmitted\n1.   Information, including in particular personal data, transmitted under this Regulation shall be used by the receiving agency only for the purpose for which it was transmitted.\n2.   Receiving agencies shall ensure the confidentiality of such information, in accordance with their national law.\n3.

They must provide the European Commission with their names and addresses, the geographical areas to which they apply, and their accepted languages and means of receipt of documents.\nEach EU country also has a central body that is responsible for supplying information to the agencies, resolving any difficulties that may arise and forwarding requests for service by the transmitting agency to the relevant receiving agency in exceptional circumstances.\nA federal state, one where there are several legal systems or which has autonomous territorial units, may name more than one such agency or central body. The designation is valid 5 years and maybe be renewed at 5-year intervals.\nSpeeding up the serving of judicial and extrajudicial documents\nThe applicant forwards documents to the transmitting agency and bears any costs of translation prior to transmitting the document. The transmitting agency is required to advise the applicant that, in the event that the document is not in a language which the addressee understands or in the official language of the EU country where service is to be effected, the latter can refuse to accept the document.\nDocuments must be transmitted directly and as soon as possible between the agencies by any appropriate means of transmission, as long as they are legible and faithful to the original. A request using the standard form as annexed to the regulation must be attached in one of the accepted languages that the EU countries indicate. The documents are exempt from legalisation or any equivalent formality. A receipt must be sent within 7 days by the receiving agency. The latter has to contact the transmitting agency as soon as possible in case of missing information.\nServing documents according to the law of the receiving EU country within 1 month\nThe receiving agency should either serve the document itself or have it served within 1 month. If this is not possible, the receiving agency must inform the transmitting agency and continue to try to serve the document. Serving is done according to the law of the receiving EU country, or by a particular method, if this is requested by the transmitting agency and it conforms to the national law. When service has been carried out, a certificate of completion of the formalities involved must be completed in a language accepted by the EU country of origin and sent to the transmitting agency.\nThe date of service will be the date on which the document is served, according to the law of the EU country addressed, except where it must be addressed within a particular period according to the law of that country. The service must not incur costs or taxes in the EU country addressed, except if there has been a particular method of service or recourse to a judicial officer there. In that case, it is up to the applicant to bear the costs. EU countries have to fix a single fee in advance, and communicate it to the Commission.\nDocuments may also be served directly by using registered post with a receipt or via the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the EU country addressed, if this is permitted by the country in question. In exceptional circumstances, documents may be forwarded to agencies of another EU country via consular or diplomatic channels.\nInforming the addressee about the right to refuse the document to be served\nThe receiving agency informs the addressee of their right to refuse the document, if it is not written in a language that he or she understands or in the official language of the EU country where service takes place. The refusal must take place at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within a week.\nIf the document is a writ of summons (an official order for someone to appear in a court of law) or equivalent and the defendant does not appear, a judgment may not be pronounced until it is sure that the document was served according to the EU countryâ€™s domestic law, it was delivered and the defendant had sufficient time to submit a defence. However, judgment may be delivered if the document was transmitted by one of the methods laid down in the regulation, and if more than 6 months have elapsed and no certificate of any kind has been obtained in spite of every reasonable effort by the competent authorities of the EU country addressed. If the defendant did not know about the document in time to appear, it is still possible to apply for relief within a reasonable time after finding out about the judgment.\nThe Commission should provide and regularly update a manual containing the information provided by the EU countries. By 2011, and every 5 years subsequently, it must present a report on the regulationâ€™s application, focusing on the agenciesâ€™ effectiveness.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EC) No 1393/2007 is repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2020/1784 as of 1 July 2022.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 13 November 2008, except for Article 23 (on EU countriesâ€™ communication and publication of certain information) which has applied since 13 August 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nService of documents (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nJudicial document: a legal document issued in the course of a civil or commercial lawsuit (for example a summons, a writ or a judgment) that must be served on a party.\nExtrajudicial document: a legal document that is served but is outside the case file (for example, an invoice or an eviction notice).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 (OJ L 324, 10.12.2007, pp. 79-120)\nSuccessive amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 have been incorporated into the original text.
