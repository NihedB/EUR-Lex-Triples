When a Party terminates a bilateral safeguard measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate that, according to its Schedule included in Annex XV to this Agreement, would have been in effect but for the measure.\nArticle 167\nProvisional measures\nIn critical circumstances where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to repair, a Party may apply a bilateral safeguard measure on a provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that the imports of a good originating in the other Party have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and such imports cause serious injury, or a threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The duration of any provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the Party shall comply with the requirements of Articles 166(2) and 166(3) of this Agreement. The Party shall promptly refund any duty paid in excess of the customs duty set out in Annex XV to this Agreement if the investigation described in Article 166(2) of this Agreement does not result in a finding that the requirements of Article 165 of this Agreement have been met.

The Party shall provide an opportunity for such consultations no later than 30 days after the application of the bilateral safeguard measure.\n2.   If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an agreement on trade-liberalising compensation within 30 days after the consultations begin, the Party whose goods are subject to the safeguard measure may suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the Party applying the safeguard measure.\n3.   The right of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first 24 months during which a bilateral safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the safeguard measure conforms to the provisions of this Agreement.\nArticle 169\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Section:\n(a)\n‘serious injury’ and ‘threat of serious injury’ shall be understood in accordance with Article 4.1(a) and (b) of the Agreement on Safeguards.

The recognition, suspension or withdrawal of equivalence rests solely with the importing Party acting in accordance with its administrative and legislative framework. That Party shall provide to the exporting Party, in writing, a full explanation and supporting data used for the determinations and decisions covered by this Article. In case of non-recognition, suspension or withdrawal of equivalence, the importing Party shall indicate to the exporting Party the required conditions on the basis of which the process referred to in paragraph 3 may be reinitiated.\n9.

For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services functions.\n3.   Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network, including the internet, include all services that provide:\n(a)\nconsulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of or for computers or computer systems;\n(b)\ncomputer programmes, defined as the sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), and consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of or for computer programmes;\n(c)\ndata processing, data storage, data hosting or database services;\n(d)\nmaintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers; or\n(e)\ntraining services for staff of clients, related to computer programmes, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.\n4.   Computer and related services enable the provision of other services (e.g. banking) by both electronic and other means. However, there is an important distinction between the enabling service (e.g. web-hosting or application hosting) and the content or core service that is being delivered electronically (e.g. banking). In such cases, the content or core service is not covered by CPC 84.\nSub-section 4\nPostal and courier services\nArticle 225\nScope and definitions\n1.

Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.\nArticle 228\nLicences\n1.   A licence may only be required for services which are within the scope of the universal service.\n2.   Where a licence is required, the following shall be made publicly available:\n(a)\nall the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and\n(b)\nthe terms and conditions of licences.\n3.   The reasons for the denial of a licence shall be made known to the applicant upon request. An appeal procedure through an independent body will be established by each Party. Such a procedure will be transparent, non-discriminatory, and based on objective criteria.\nArticle 229\nIndependence of the regulatory body\nThe regulatory body shall be legally separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of postal and courier services. The decisions of and the procedures used by the regulatory body shall be impartial with respect to all market participants.\nArticle 230\nGradual approximation\nEach Party recognises the importance of the gradual approximation of the Republic of Moldova's existing and future legislation to the list of the Union acquis set out in Annex XXVIII-C to this Agreement.\nSub-section 5\nElectronic communication networks and services\nArticle 231\nScope and definitions\n1.

Each Party shall ensure that the decisions of and the procedures used by the regulatory authorities are impartial with respect to all market participants and transparent.\n4.   The regulatory authority shall have the power to carry out an analysis of relevant product and service markets susceptible to an ex ante regulation. Where the regulatory authority is required to determine under Article 234 of this Agreement whether to impose, maintain, amend or withdraw obligations it shall determine on the basis of a market analysis whether the relevant market is effectively competitive.\n5.   Where the regulatory authority determines that a relevant market is not effectively competitive, it shall identify and designate services suppliers with significant market power on that market and shall impose, maintain or amend specific regulatory obligations referred to in Article 234 of this Agreement, as appropriate.

Each Party shall ensure that a services supplier affected by the decision of a regulatory authority shall have a right to appeal against that decision to an appeal body that is independent of the parties involved in the decision. Each Party shall ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account.

Decisions taken by appeal bodies shall be effectively enforced.\n7.   Each Party shall ensure that where the regulatory authorities intend to take measures related to any of the provisions of this Sub-Section and which have a significant impact to the relevant market, they give the interested parties the opportunity to comment on the draft measure within a reasonable period of time.

Each Party shall ensure that all suppliers are eligible to ensure universal service and no services supplier is excluded a priori. The designation shall be made through an efficient, transparent, objective and non-discriminatory mechanism.

The decision of the regulatory authority shall be made available to the public, having regard to the requirements of business confidentiality.

By the end of the fifth year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, shall review the measures taken and determine the modalities for further liberalisation.\nCHAPTER 8\nPublic procurement\nArticle 268\nObjectives\n1.   The Parties recognise the contribution of transparent, non-discriminatory, competitive and open tendering to sustainable economic development and set as their objective the effective, reciprocal and gradual opening of their respective procurement markets.\n2.   This Chapter envisages mutual access to public procurement markets on the basis of the principle of national treatment at national, regional and local level for public contracts and concessions in the public sector as well as in the utilities sector. It provides for a gradual approximation of the public procurement legislation in the Republic of Moldova with the Union acquis on public procurement, accompanied with an institutional reform and the creation of an efficient public procurement system based on the principles governing public procurement in the Union and the terms and definitions set out in Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts and Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors.\nArticle 269\nScope\n1.   This Chapter applies to works, supplies and services public contracts, as well as works, supplies and service contracts in the utilities sectors and works and services concessions.\n2.   This Chapter applies to any contracting authority and any contracting entity which meets the definitions of the Union acquis on public procurement (hereinafter referred to as the ‘contracting entities’). It also covers bodies governed by public law and public undertakings in the field of utilities, such as state-owned enterprises carrying out the relevant activities, and private undertakings operating on the basis of special and exclusive rights in the field of utilities.\n3.   This Chapter applies to contracts above value thresholds set out in Annex XXIX-A to this Agreement.\n4.   The calculation of the estimated value of a public contract shall be based on the total amount payable, net of taxes on value added. When applying those thresholds, the Republic of Moldova will calculate and convert contract values into its national currency, using the conversion rate of its National Bank.\n5.   Value thresholds shall be revised regularly every two years, beginning in the year of entry into force of this Agreement, based on the average daily value of the euro, expressed in Special Drawing Rights, over the 24 month period terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision, with effect from January 1. The value of the thresholds thus revised shall, where necessary, be rounded down to nearest thousand euro. The revision of the thresholds shall be adopted by decision of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement.\nArticle 270\nInstitutional background\n1.   Each Party shall establish or maintain an appropriate institutional framework and mechanisms necessary for the proper functioning of the public procurement system and the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter.\n2.   In the framework of institutional reform, the Republic of Moldova shall designate in particular:\n(a)\nan executive body responsible for economic policy at central government level tasked with guaranteeing a coherent policy in all areas related to public procurement. Such a body shall facilitate and coordinate the implementation of this Chapter and guide the process of gradual approximation to the Union acquis; and\n(b)\nan impartial and independent body tasked with the review of decisions taken by contracting authorities or entities during the award of contracts. In that context, ‘independent’ means that that body shall be a public authority which is separate from all contracting entities and economic operators. There shall be a possibility to subject the decisions taken by that body to judicial review.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that decisions taken by the authorities responsible for the review of complaints by economic operators concerning infringements of domestic law shall be effectively enforced.\nArticle 271\nBasic standards regulating the award of contracts\n1.   No later than nine months from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall comply with a set of basic standards for the award of all contracts as stipulated in paragraphs 2 to 15. Those basic standards derive directly from the rules and principles of public procurement, as regulated in the Union acquis on public procurement, including the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency and proportionality.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that all intended procurements are published in an appropriate medium in a manner that is sufficient to:\n(a)\nenable the market to be opened up to competition; and\n(b)\nallow any interested economic operator to have appropriate access to information regarding the intended procurement prior to the award of the contract and to express its interest in obtaining the contract.\n3.   The publication shall be appropriate to the economic interest of the contract to economic operators.\n4.   The publication shall contain at least the essential details of the contract to be awarded, the criteria for qualitative selection, the award method, the contract award criteria and any other additional information that the economic operators reasonably need to decide on whether to express their interest in obtaining the contract.\n5.   All contracts shall be awarded through transparent and impartial award procedures that prevent corrupt practices. That impartiality shall be ensured in particular through the non-discriminatory description of the subject matter of the contract, equal access for all economic operators, appropriate time-limits and a transparent and objective approach.\n6.   When describing the characteristics of the required work, supply or service, the contracting entities shall use general descriptions of performance and functions and international, European or national standards.\n7.   The description of the characteristics required of a work, supply or service shall not refer to a specific make or source, or a particular process, or to trademarks, patents, types or a specific origin or production unless such a reference is justified by the subject matter of the contract and accompanied by the words ‘or equivalent’. Preference shall be given to the use of general descriptions of performance or functions.\n8.   Contracting entities shall not impose conditions resulting in direct or indirect discrimination against the economic operators of the other Party, such as the requirement that economic operators interested in the contract are required to be established in the same country, region or territory as the contracting entity.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, in cases where it is justified by the specific circumstances of the contract, the successful applicant may be required to establish certain business infrastructure at the place of performance.\n9.   The time-limits for expression of interest and for submission of offers shall be sufficiently long to allow economic operators from the other Party to make a meaningful assessment of the tender and prepare their offer.\n10.   All participants are required to know the applicable rules, selection criteria and award criteria in advance. Those rules must apply equally to all participants.\n11.   Contracting entities may invite a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, provided that:\n(a)\nit is done in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner; and\n(b)\nthe selection is based only on objective factors such as the experience of the applicants in the sector concerned, the size and infrastructure of their businesses or their technical and professional abilities.\nIn inviting a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, account shall be taken of the need to ensure adequate competition.\n12.   Contracting entities may use negotiated procedures only in exceptional and defined cases when the use of such a procedure effectively does not distort competition.\n13.   Contracting entities may use qualification systems only under the condition that the list of qualified operators is compiled by means of a sufficiently advertised, transparent and open procedure. Contracts falling within the scope of such a system shall be awarded also on a non-discriminatory basis.\n14.   Each Party shall ensure that contracts are awarded in a transparent manner to the applicant who has submitted the economically most advantageous offer or the offer with the lowest price, based on the tender criteria and the procedural rules established and communicated in advance. The final decisions shall be communicated to all applicants without undue delay. Upon request of an unsuccessful applicant, reasons must be provided in sufficient detail to allow the review of such a decision.\n15.   Each Party shall ensure that any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been, or risks being, harmed by an alleged infringement is entitled to effective, impartial judicial protection against any decision of the contracting entity related to the award of that contract. The decisions taken in the course and at the end of such review procedure shall be made public in a manner that is sufficient to inform all interested economic operators.\nArticle 272\nPlanning of gradual approximation\n1.   Prior to the commencement of gradual approximation, the Republic of Moldova shall submit to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, a comprehensive roadmap for the implementation of this Chapter with time schedules and milestones which shall include all reforms in terms of approximation to the Union acquis and institutional capacity building. This roadmap shall comply with the phases and time schedules set out in Annex XXIX-B to this Agreement.\n2.   The roadmap shall cover all aspects of the reform and the general legal framework for the implementation of public procurement activities, in particular, approximation for public contracts, contracts in the utilities sector, works concessions and review procedures, and strengthening of the administrative capacity at all levels, including review bodies and enforcement mechanisms.\n3.   Following a favourable opinion by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, the roadmap shall be considered as the reference document for the implementation of this Chapter. The Union shall make its best efforts in assisting the Republic of Moldova in the implementation of the roadmap.\nArticle 273\nGradual approximation\n1.   The Republic of Moldova shall ensure that its existing and future legislation on public procurement will be gradually made compatible with the Union acquis on public procurement.\n2.   Approximation to the Union acquis shall be carried out in consecutive phases as set out in the schedule in Annex XXIX-B to this Agreement and further specified in Annexes XXIX-C to XXIX-F, XXIX-H, XXIX-I, and XXIX-K thereof. Annexes XXIX-G and XXIX-J to this Agreement identify non-mandatory elements that need not be approximated, whereas Annexes XXIX-L to XXIX-O to this Agreement identify elements of the Union acquis that remain outside the scope of approximation. In that process, due account shall be taken of the corresponding case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the implementing measures adopted by the European Commission, as well as, should it become necessary, of any modifications of the Union acquis occurring in the meantime. The implementation of each phase shall be evaluated by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, and, following a positive assessment by that Committee, it shall be linked to the reciprocal granting of market access as set out in Annex XXIX-B to this Agreement. The European Commission shall notify without undue delay the Republic of Moldova of any modifications to the Union acquis. It shall provide appropriate advice and technical assistance for the purpose of implementing such modifications.\n3.   The Association Committee in Trade configuration shall only proceed to the evaluation of a next phase once the measures to implement the previous phase have been carried out and approved according to the modalities set out in paragraph 2.\n4.   Each Party shall ensure that those aspects and areas of public procurement which are not covered by this Article comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment as set out under Article 271 of this Agreement.\nArticle 274\nMarket access\n1.   The Parties agree that the effective and reciprocal opening of their respective markets shall be attained gradually and simultaneously. During the process of approximation, the extent of the market access mutually granted shall be linked to the progress made in that process as stipulated in Annex XXIX-B to this Agreement.\n2.   The decision to proceed to a further phase of market opening shall be made on the basis of an assessment of the quality of the legislation adopted as well as its practical implementation. Such assessment shall be carried out regularly by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement.\n3.   In so far as a Party has, according to Annex XXIX-B to this Agreement, opened its procurement market to the other Party:\n(a)\nthe Union shall grant access to contract award procedures to companies of the Republic of Moldova, whether established or not in the Union, pursuant to Union public procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Union companies;\n(b)\nthe Republic of Moldova shall grant access to contract award procedures for Union companies, whether established or not in the Republic of Moldova, pursuant to national procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to companies of the Republic of Moldova.\n4.   After the implementation of the last phase in the process of approximation, the Parties will examine the possibility to grant mutual market access with regard to procurements below the value thresholds set out in Annex XXIX-A to this Agreement.\n5.   Finland reserves its position with regard to the Åland Islands.\nArticle 275\nInformation\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that contracting entities and economic operators are appropriately informed about public procurement procedures, including through the publication of all relevant legislation and administrative rulings.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure the effective dissemination of information on tendering opportunities.\nArticle 276\nCooperation\n1.   The Parties shall enhance their cooperation through exchanges of experience and information relating to their best practices and regulatory frameworks.\n2.   The Union shall facilitate the implementation of this Chapter, including through technical assistance where appropriate. In line with the provisions in Title VI (Financial Assistance, and Anti-Fraud and Control Provisions) of this Agreement, specific decisions on financial assistance shall be taken through the relevant Union funding mechanisms and instruments.\n3.   An indicative list of issues for cooperation is included in Annex XXIX-P to this Agreement.\nCHAPTER 9\nIntellectual property rights\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions and principles\nArticle 277\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this Chapter are to:\n(a)\nfacilitate the production and commercialisation of innovative and creative products between the Parties; and\n(b)\nachieve an adequate and effective level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nArticle 278\nNature and scope of obligations\n1.

Each Party may, in the absence of agreement between the performers and phonogram producers, lay down the conditions as to the sharing of that remuneration between them.\nArticle 286\nTerm of protection\n1.   The rights of an author of a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Article 2 of the Berne Convention shall run for the life of the author and for 70 years after his/her death, irrespective of the date when the work is lawfully made available to the public.\n2.

Having examined the legislation of the Republic of Moldova on the protection of geographical indications listed in Part A of Annex XXX-A of this Agreement, the Union concludes that that legislation meets the elements laid down in Part C of Annex XXX-A to this Agreement.\n2.   Having examined the legislation of the Union on the protection of geographical indications listed in Part B of Annex XXX-A to this Agreement, the Republic of Moldova concludes that that legislation meets the elements laid down in Part C of Annex XXX-A to this Agreement.\n3.   The Government of the Republic of Moldova, after having completed an objection procedure in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex XXX-B to this Agreement, and after having examined the geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs of the Union listed in Annex XXX-C to this Agreement and the geographical indications for wines, aromatised wines and spirit drinks of the Union listed in Annex XXX-D to this Agreement, which have been registered by the Union under the legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall protect those geographical indications according to the level of protection laid down in this Sub-Section.\n4.   The Union, after having completed an objection procedure in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex XXX-B to this Agreement and after having examined the geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs of the Republic of Moldova listed in Annex XXX-C to this Agreement and the geographical indications for wines, aromatised wines and spirit drinks of the Republic of Moldova listed in Annex XXX-D to this Agreement, which have been registered by the Republic of Moldova under the legislation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall protect those geographical indications according to the level of protection laid down in this Sub-Section.\n5.   The decisions of the Joint Committee set up by Article 11 of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on the protection of geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs concerning the amendment of Annexes III and IV to that Agreement, which are taken before the entry into force of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be decisions of the Geographical Indications Sub-Committee, and the geographical indications added to Annexes III and IV to that Agreement shall be deemed to be part of Annexes XXX-C and XXX-D to this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties shall protect those geographical indications as established geographical indications under this Agreement.\nArticle 298\nAddition of new geographical indications\n1.   The Parties agree on the possibility to add new geographical indications to be protected in Annexes XXX-C and XXX-D to this Agreement in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 306(3) of this Agreement after having completed the objection procedure and after having examined the geographical indications as referred to in Article 297(3) and 297(4) of this Agreement to the satisfaction of both Parties.\n2.   A Party shall not be required to protect as a geographical indication a name that conflicts with the name of a plant variety, including a wine grape variety, or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\nArticle 299\nScope of protection of geographical indications\n1.   The geographical indications listed in Annexes XXX-C and XXX-D to this Agreement, as well as those added pursuant to Article 298 of this Agreement, shall be protected against:\n(a)\nany direct or indirect commercial use of a protected name:\n(i)\nfor comparable products not compliant with the product specification of the protected name; or\n(ii)\nin so far as such use exploits the reputation of a geographical indication;\n(b)\nany misuse, imitation or evocation (26), even if the true origin of the product is indicated or if the protected name is translated, transcribed, transliterated or accompanied by an expression such as ‘style’, ‘type’, ‘method’, ‘as produced in’, ‘imitation’, ‘flavour’, ‘like’ or similar;\n(c)\nany other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product, on the inner or outer packaging, advertising material or documents relating to the product concerned, and the packing of the product in a container liable to convey a false impression as to its origin; and\n(d)\nany other practice liable to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\n2.   If geographical indications are wholly or partially homonymous, protection shall be granted to each indication provided that it has been used in good faith and with due regard for local and traditional usage and the actual risk of confusion. Without prejudice to Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement, the Parties shall mutually decide the practical conditions of use under which the homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled. A homonymous name which misleads the consumer into believing that products come from another territory shall not be registered even if the name is accurate as far as the actual territory, region or place of origin of the product in question is concerned.\n3.   Where a Party, in the context of negotiations with a third country, proposes to protect a geographical indication of that third country, and the name is homonymous with a geographical indication of the other Party, the latter shall be consulted and given the opportunity to comment before the name is protected.\n4.   Nothing in this Sub-Section shall oblige a Party to protect a geographical indication of the other Party which is not or ceases to be protected in its country of origin. The Parties shall notify each other if a geographical indication ceases to be protected in its country of origin.\n5.   The provisions of this Sub-Section shall in no way prejudice the right of any person to use, in the course of trade, that person's name or the name of that person's predecessor in business, except where that name is used in such a manner as to mislead consumers.\nArticle 300\nRight of use of geographical indications\n1.

Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of this Article, the Parties shall protect geographical indications also where a prior trademark exists. A prior trademark shall mean a trademark, the use of which corresponds to one of the situations referred to in Article 299(1) of this Agreement, which has been applied for, registered or established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the legislation concerned, in the territory of one of the Parties before the date on which the application for protection of the geographical indication is submitted by the other Party under this Sub-Section.

Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently created designs that are new and original (27). That protection shall be provided by registration, which shall confer an exclusive right upon the holders of a registered design in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n2.   A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and original:\n(a)\nif the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the product; and\n(b)\nto the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality.\n3.   The expression ‘normal use’ in paragraph 2(a) shall mean use by the end user, excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work.\n4.   The holder of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from, at a minimum, making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking or using a product bearing or embodying the protected design when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes, unduly prejudice the normal exploitation of the design, or are not compatible with fair trade practices.\n5.   The duration of protection available shall amount to 25 years from the date of filing of the application for registration.\nArticle 309\nProtection conferred to unregistered designs\n1.   Each Party shall provide the legal means to prevent the use of unregistered designs, only if the contested use results from copying the unregistered appearance of the product. For the purposes of this Article, the term ‘use’ includes the offering for sale, putting on the market, importing or exporting the product.\n2.   The duration of protection available for unregistered designs shall amount to at least three years from the date on which the design was made available to the public in one of the Parties.\nArticle 310\nExceptions and exclusions\n1.   Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.\n2.   Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations. In particular a design right shall not subsist in features of appearance of a product which are required to be reproduced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function.\nArticle 311\nRelationship to copyright\nA design shall also be eligible for protection under the copyright law of a Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such a protection is conferred, including the level of originality required, shall be determined by each Party.\nSub-section 5\nPatents\nArticle 312\nInternational agreements\nThe Parties shall adhere to the provisions of the WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty and shall make all reasonable efforts to comply with the WIPO Patent Law Treaty.\nArticle 313\nPatents and public health\n1.

The Parties recognise that medicinal and plant protection products protected by a patent may be subject to an administrative authorisation procedure before being put on their market. They recognise that the period that elapses between the filing of the application for a patent and the first authorisation to place the product on their respective market, as defined for that purpose by domestic law, may shorten the period of effective protection under the patent.\n2.   Each Party shall provide for a further period of protection for a medicinal or plant protection product which is protected by a patent and which has been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure, that period being equal to the period referred to in the second sentence of paragraph 1, reduced by a period of five years.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the duration of the further period of protection may not exceed five years.\n4.   In the case of medicinal products for which paediatric studies have been carried out, and provided that results of those studies are reflected in the product information, the Parties shall provide for a further six months extension of the period of protection referred to in paragraph 2.\nArticle 315\nProtection of data submitted to obtain an authorisation to put a medicinal product on the market\n1.   Each Party shall implement a comprehensive system to guarantee the confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-reliance of data submitted for the purpose of obtaining an authorisation to put a medicinal product on the market. (28)\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that any required information that is submitted to obtain an authorisation to put a medicinal product on the market remains undisclosed to third parties and benefits from protection against unfair commercial use.\nTo that end,\n(a)\nduring a period of at least five years, starting from the date of the grant of a marketing authorisation in the Party concerned, no person or entity, whether public or private, other than the person or entity who submitted such undisclosed data, shall be allowed to rely directly or indirectly on such data, without the explicit consent of the person or entity who submitted that data, in support of an application for the authorisation to put a medicinal product on the market;\n(b)\nduring a period of at least seven years, starting from the date of the grant of a marketing authorisation in the Party concerned, a marketing authorisation for any subsequent application shall not be granted, unless the subsequent applicant submits his/her own data, or data used with authorisation of the holder of the first authorisation, meeting the same requirements as in the case of the first authorisation. Products registered without submission of such data shall be removed from the market until the requirements are met.\n3.   The seven-year period referred to in paragraph 2(b) shall be extended to a maximum of eight years if, during the first five years after obtaining the initial authorisation, the holder obtains an authorisation for one or more new therapeutic indications considered to be of significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.\n4.   The provisions of this Article shall not have retroactive effect. They shall not affect the marketing of medicinal products authorised before the entry into force of this Agreement.\n5.   The Republic of Moldova undertakes to align its legislation concerning data protection for medicinal products with that of the Union at a date to be decided by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement.\nArticle 316\nData protection on plant protection products\n1.   Each Party shall determine safety and efficacy requirements before authorising the placing on the market of plant protection products.\n2.   Each Party shall assign a temporary data protection right to the owner of a test or study report submitted for the first time to obtain a marketing authorisation for a plant protection product.\nDuring the period of validity of the data protection right, the test or study report shall not be used for the benefit of any other person aiming to obtain a marketing authorisation for a plant protection product, except when the explicit consent of the owner is provided.\n3.   The test or study report shall fulfil the following conditions:\n(a)\nthat it is necessary for the authorisation or for an amendment of an authorisation in order to allow the use on other crops; and\n(b)\nthat it is certified as compliant with the principles of good laboratory practice or of good experimental practice.\n4.   The period of data protection shall be at least 10 years from the first authorisation in the Party concerned. In case of low risk plant protection products, the period may be extended to 13 years.\n5.   The periods referred to in paragraph 4 shall be extended by three months for each extension of authorisation for minor uses (29) if the applications for such authorisations are made by the holder of the authorisation at the latest five years after the date of the first authorisation. The total period of data protection may in no case exceed 13 years. For low risk plant protection products the total period of data protection may in no case exceed 15 years.\n6.   A test or study report shall also be protected if it was necessary for the renewal or review of an authorisation. In those cases, the period for data protection shall be 30 months.\nArticle 317\nPlant varieties\nThe Parties shall protect plant varieties rights, in accordance with the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants including the optional exception to the breeder's right as referred to in Article 15(2) of the said Convention, and shall cooperate to promote and enforce those rights.\nSection 3\nEnforcement of intellectual property rights\nArticle 318\nGeneral obligations\n1.   The Parties reaffirm their commitments under the TRIPS Agreement, in particular Part III thereof, and shall provide for the complementary measures, procedures and remedies set forth in this Section necessary to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights (30).\n2.   Those complementary measures, procedures and remedies shall be fair and equitable, and shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.\n3.   Those complementary measures and remedies shall also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.\nArticle 319\nEntitled applicants\nEach Party shall recognise as persons entitled to seek application of the measures, procedures and remedies referred to in this Section and in Part III of the TRIPS Agreement:\n(a)\nthe holders of intellectual property rights in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law;\n(b)\nall other persons authorised to use those rights, in particular licensees, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law;\n(c)\nintellectual property collective rights management bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law; and\n(d)\nprofessional defence bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law.\nSub-section 1\nCivil enforcement\nArticle 320\nMeasures for preserving evidence\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that, even before the commencement of proceedings on the merits of the case, the competent judicial authorities may, on application by a party who has presented reasonably available evidence to support his/her claims that his/her intellectual property right has been infringed or is about to be infringed, order prompt and effective provisional measures to preserve relevant evidence in respect of the alleged infringement, subject to the protection of confidential information.\n2.   Such measures may include the detailed description, with or without the taking of samples, or the physical seizure of the alleged infringing goods, and, in appropriate cases, the materials and implements used in the production and/or distribution of those goods and the documents relating thereto. Those measures shall be taken, if necessary, without the other party being heard, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holder or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed.\nArticle 321\nRight of information\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that, in the context of proceedings concerning an infringement of an intellectual property right and in response to a justified and proportionate request of the claimant, the competent judicial authorities may order that information on the origin and distribution networks of the goods or services which infringe an intellectual property right be provided by the infringer and/or any other person who:\n(a)\nwas found in possession of the infringing goods on a commercial scale;\n(b)\nwas found to be using the infringing services on a commercial scale;\n(c)\nwas found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities;\n(d)\nwas indicated by the person referred to in point (a), (b) or (c) as being involved in the production, manufacture or distribution of the goods or the provision of the services.\n2.   The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall, as appropriate, comprise:\n(a)\nthe names and addresses of the producers, manufacturers, distributors, suppliers and other previous holders of the goods or services, as well as the intended wholesalers and retailers;\n(b)\ninformation on the quantities produced, manufactured, delivered, received or ordered, as well as the price obtained for the goods or services in question.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to other statutory provisions which:\n(a)\ngrant the right holder rights to receive fuller information;\n(b)\ngovern the use in civil or criminal proceedings of the information communicated pursuant to this Article;\n(c)\ngovern responsibility for misuse of the right of information;\n(d)\nafford an opportunity for refusing to provide information which would force the person referred to in paragraph 1 to admit to his/her own participation or that of his/her close relatives in an infringement of an intellectual property right; or\n(e)\ngovern the protection of confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data.\nArticle 322\nProvisional and precautionary measures\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that the judicial authorities may, at the request of the applicant, issue against the alleged infringer an interlocutory injunction intended to prevent any imminent infringement of an intellectual property right, or to forbid, on a provisional basis and subject, where appropriate, to a recurring penalty payment where provided for by domestic law, the continuation of the alleged infringements of that right, or to make such continuation subject to the lodging of guarantees intended to ensure the compensation of the right holder. An interlocutory injunction may also be issued, under the same conditions, against an intermediary whose services are being used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right.\n2.   An interlocutory injunction may also be issued to order the seizure or delivery of goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right, so as to prevent their entry into or movement within the channels of commerce.\n3.   In the case of an alleged infringement committed on a commercial scale, the Parties shall ensure that, if the applicant demonstrates circumstances likely to endanger the recovery of damages, the judicial authorities may order the precautionary seizure of the movable and immovable property of the alleged infringer, including the blocking of his/her bank accounts and other assets. To that end, the competent authorities may order the communication of bank, financial or commercial documents, or appropriate access to the relevant information.\nArticle 323\nCorrective measures\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that the competent judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant and without prejudice to any damages due to the right holder by reason of the infringement, and without compensation of any sort, at least the definitive removal from the channels of commerce, or the destruction, of goods that they have found to be infringing an intellectual property right. If appropriate, the competent judicial authorities may also order the destruction of materials and implements predominantly used in the creation or manufacture of those goods.\n2.   The Parties' judicial authorities shall have the power to order that those measures shall be carried out at the expense of the infringer, unless particular reasons are invoked for not doing so.\nArticle 324\nInjunctions\nEach Party shall ensure that, where a judicial decision has been taken, finding an infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may issue against the infringer, as well as against an intermediary whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right, an injunction aimed at prohibiting the continuation of the infringement.\nArticle 325\nAlternative measures\nThe Parties may provide that, in appropriate cases and at the request of the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in Article 323 and/or Article 324 of this Agreement, the competent judicial authorities may order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in those two Articles if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, if execution of the measures in question would cause him/her disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.\nArticle 326\nDamages\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that the judicial authorities, on application of the injured party, order the infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in an infringing activity, to pay the right-holder damages appropriate to the actual prejudice suffered by him/her as a result of the infringement. When the judicial authorities set the amount of damages:\n(a)\nthey shall take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative economic consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringer and, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors, such as the moral prejudice caused to the right holder by the infringement; or\n(b)\nas an alternative to point (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set the amount of damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as, at least, the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.\n2.   Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in the infringing activity, the Parties may lay down that the judicial authorities may order in favour of the injured party the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established.\nArticle 327\nLegal costs\nEach Party shall ensure that reasonable and proportionate legal costs and other expenses incurred by the successful party shall, as a general rule, be borne by the unsuccessful party, unless equity does not allow this.\nArticle 328\nPublication of judicial decisions\nEach Party shall ensure that, in legal proceedings instituted for infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant and at the expense of the infringer, appropriate measures for the dissemination of the information concerning the decision, including displaying the decision and publishing it in full or in part.\nArticle 329\nPresumption of authorship or ownership\nFor the purposes of applying the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in this Section:\n(a)\nfor the author of a literary or artistic work, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to be regarded as such, and consequently to be entitled to institute infringement proceedings, it shall be sufficient for his/her name to appear on the work in the usual manner;\n(b)\npoint (a) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the holders of rights related to copyright with regard to their protected subject matter.\nSub-section 2\nOther provisions\nArticle 330\nBorder measures\n1.   Each Party shall, unless otherwise provided for in this Sub-Section, adopt procedures to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for suspecting that the importation, exportation, re-exportation, entry or exit of the customs territory, placement under a suspensive procedure or placement under a free zone or a free warehouse of goods infringing an intellectual property right (31) may take place, to lodge an application in writing with the competent authorities, whether administrative or judicial, for the suspension by the customs authorities of the release or detention of such goods.\n2.   Each Party shall provide that when the customs authorities, in the course of their actions and before an application has been lodged by a right holder or granted, have sufficient grounds for suspecting that goods infringe an intellectual property right, they may suspend the release of the goods or detain them in order to enable the right holder to submit an application for action in accordance with paragraph 1.\n3.   Any rights or obligations concerning the importer which are established in domestic law for the implementation of this Article and of Section 4 of Part III of the TRIPS Agreement shall be also applicable to the exporter or to the holder of the goods.\n4.   Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities require a right holder who requests the procedures described in paragraph 1 to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law of the Party providing the procedures, there is a prima facie infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right, and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder's knowledge to make the suspect goods reasonably recognisable by the competent authorities. The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to the procedures described in paragraph 1.\n5.   With a view to establishing whether an intellectual property right has been infringed, the customs office shall inform the right holder, at his/her request and if known, of the names and addresses of the consignee, the consignor or the holder of the goods and the origin and provenance of goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right.\nThe customs office shall also give the applicant the opportunity to inspect goods whose release has been suspended or which have been detained. When examining goods, the customs office may take samples and hand them over or send them to the right holder, at his/her request, strictly for the purposes of analysis and to facilitate the subsequent procedure.\n6.   The customs authorities shall be active in targeting and identifying shipments containing goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right on the basis of risk analysis techniques. They shall set up systems for close cooperation with right holders, including effective mechanisms to collect information for the risk analysis.\n7.   The Parties agree to cooperate with a view to eliminating international trade in goods infringing intellectual property rights. In particular, for that purpose, they shall, where appropriate, exchange information and arrange for cooperation between their competent authorities with regard to trade in goods infringing intellectual property rights.\n8.   For goods in transit through the territory of a Party destined for the territory of the other Party, the former Party shall provide information to the latter Party to enable effective enforcement against shipments of goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right.\n9.   Without prejudice to other forms of cooperation, Protocol III on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters will be applicable with regard to paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article with respect to breaches of customs legislation related to intellectual property rights.\n10.

The Parties shall endeavour to resolve any dispute referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement by entering into consultations in good faith with the aim of reaching a mutually agreed solution.\n2.   A Party shall seek consultations by means of a written request to the other Party, copied to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, giving reasons for the request, including by identifying the measure at issue and the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement that it considers applicable.\n3.   Consultations shall be held within 30 days of the date of receipt of the request and take place, unless the Parties agree otherwise, in the territory of the Party to which the request is made. The consultations shall be deemed concluded within 30 days of the date of receipt of the request, unless both Parties agree to continue consultations. Consultations, in particular all information disclosed and positions taken by the Parties during the consultations, shall be confidential, and without prejudice to the rights of either Party in any further proceedings.\n4.   Consultations on matters of urgency, including those regarding perishable goods or seasonal goods or services, shall be held within 15 days of the date of receipt of the request by the requested Party, and shall be deemed concluded within those 15 days unless both Parties agree to continue consultations.\n5.   If the Party to which the request is made does not respond to the request for consultations within 10 days of the date of its receipt, or if consultations are not held within the timeframes laid down in paragraph 3 or in paragraph 4 of this Article, respectively, or if the Parties agree not to have consultations, or if consultations have been concluded and no mutually agreed solution has been reached, the Party that sought consultations may have recourse to Article 384 of this Agreement.\n6.   During the consultations each Party shall deliver sufficient factual information, so as to allow a complete examination of the manner in which the measure at issue could affect the operation and the application of this Agreement.\n7.   Where consultations concern the transport of energy goods through networks and one Party views the resolution of the dispute as urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of transport of natural gas, oil or electricity between the Parties, the consultations shall be held within three days of the date of submission of the request, and shall be deemed concluded three days after the date of submission of the request unless both Parties agree to continue consultations.\nArticle 383\nMediation\nAny Party may request the other Party to enter into a mediation procedure with respect to any measure adversely affecting trade or investment between the Parties pursuant to Annex XXXII to this Agreement.\nSection 3\nDispute settlement procedures\nSub-section 1\nArbitration procedure\nArticle 384\nInitiation of the arbitration procedure\n1.   Where the Parties have failed to resolve the dispute by recourse to consultations as provided for in Article 382 of this Agreement, the Party that sought consultations may request the establishment of an arbitration panel in accordance with this Article.\n2.   The request for the establishment of an arbitration panel shall be made in writing to the other Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement.

In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on the composition of the arbitration panel within the time frame laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article, each Party may appoint an arbitrator from its sub-list established under Article 404 of this Agreement within five days from the expiry of the timeframe established in paragraph 2 of this Article. If any of the Parties fails to appoint the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall, upon request of the other Party, be selected by lot by the chair of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, or the chair's delegate, from the sub-list of that Party contained in the list established under Article 404 of this Agreement.\n4.   Unless the Parties reach an agreement concerning the chairperson of the arbitration panel within the timeframe established in paragraph 2 of this Article, the chair of the Association Committee in Trade configuration or the chair's delegate shall, upon request of any of the Parties, select by lot the chairperson of the arbitration panel from the sub-list of chairpersons contained in the list established under Article 404 of this Agreement.\n5.

Should any of the lists provided for in Article 404 of this Agreement not be established or not contain sufficient names at the time a request is made pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, the arbitrators shall be drawn by lot from the individuals who have been formally proposed by one or both of the Parties.\n8.   Unless the Parties agree otherwise, in respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related Energy) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil, or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, the second sentence of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 shall apply without recourse to paragraph 2, and the period referred to in paragraph 5 shall be of two days.\nArticle 386\nPreliminary ruling on urgency\nIf a Party so requests, the arbitration panel shall, within 10 days of its establishment, give a preliminary ruling on whether it deems the case to be urgent.\nArticle 387\nArbitration panel report\n1.   The arbitration panel shall notify an interim report to the Parties setting out the findings of fact, the applicability of relevant provisions and the basic rationale behind any findings and recommendations that it makes, not later than 90 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. Where it considers that that deadline cannot be met, the chairperson of the arbitration panel shall notify the Parties and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the arbitration panel plans to notify its interim report.

A Party may submit a written request to the arbitration panel to review precise aspects of the interim report, within 7 days of the notification of the interim report.\n4.   After considering any written comments by the Parties on the interim report, the arbitration panel may modify its report and make any further examination it considers appropriate. The findings of the final panel ruling shall include a sufficient discussion of the arguments made at the interim review stage, and shall answer clearly to the questions and observations of the Parties.\n5.   In respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related Energy) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, the interim report shall be notified 20 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration panel, and any request pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article shall be made within five days of the notification of the written report. The arbitration panel may also decide to dispense with the interim report.\nArticle 388\nConciliation for urgent energy disputes\n1.

The conciliator shall seek an agreed resolution of the dispute or seek to agree a procedure to achieve such resolution. If within 15 days of his/her appointment he/she has failed to secure such agreement, he/she shall recommend a resolution to the dispute or a procedure to achieve such resolution and shall decide on the terms and conditions to be observed from a date which he/she shall specify until the dispute is resolved.\n3.   The Parties and the entities under their control or jurisdiction shall respect recommendations made under paragraph 2 on the terms and conditions for three months following the conciliator's decision or until resolution of the dispute, whichever is earlier.\n4.   The conciliator shall respect the Code of Conduct set out in Annex XXXIV to this Agreement.\nArticle 389\nNotification of the ruling of the arbitration panel\n1.

In respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related Energy) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, the arbitration panel shall notify its ruling within 40 days from the date of its establishment.\nSub-section 2\nCompliance\nArticle 390\nCompliance with the arbitration panel ruling\nThe Party complained against shall take any measure necessary to comply promptly and in good faith with the arbitration panel ruling.\nArticle 391\nReasonable period of time for compliance\n1.   If immediate compliance is not possible, the Parties shall endeavour to agree on the period of time to comply with the ruling. In such a case, the Party complained against shall, no later than 30 days after the receipt of the notification of the arbitration panel ruling to the Parties, notify the complaining Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, of the time it will require for compliance (‘reasonable period of time’) and provide reasons for the proposed reasonable period of time.\n2.   If there is disagreement between the Parties on the reasonable period of time to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, the complaining Party shall, within 20 days of the receipt of the notification made under paragraph 1 by the Party complained against, request in writing the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration. The original arbitration panel shall notify its ruling to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 20 days from the date of submission of the request.\n3.   The Party complained against shall inform the complaining Party in writing of its progress to comply with the arbitration panel ruling at least 30 days before the expiry of the reasonable period of time.\n4.   The reasonable period of time may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.\nArticle 392\nReview of any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, before the end of the reasonable period of time of any measure that it has taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling.\n2.   In the event that there is disagreement between the Parties concerning the existence or the consistency of any measure taken to comply as notified in paragraph 1 with the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement, the complaining Party may request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall identify the specific measure at issue and explain how such measure is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement, in a manner sufficient to present the legal basis for the complaint clearly. The original arbitration panel shall notify its ruling to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 45 days of the date of submission of the request.\nArticle 393\nTemporary remedies in case of non-compliance\n1.   If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the arbitration panel rules that no measure taken to comply exists or that the measure notified under Article 392(1) of this Agreement is inconsistent with that Party's obligations under the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party and after consultations with that Party, present an offer for temporary compensation.\n2.   If the complaining Party decides not to request an offer for temporary compensation under paragraph 1 of this Article, or, in case such request is made but no agreement on compensation is reached within 30 days from the end of the reasonable period of time or of the notification of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 392 of this Agreement that no measure taken to comply exists or that a measure taken to comply is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, to suspend obligations arising from any provision referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement at a level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. The notification shall specify the level of suspension of obligations. The complaining Party may implement the suspension at any moment after the expiry of 10 days after the date of receipt of the notification by the Party complained against, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph 3 of this Article.\n3.   If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation, it may request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the complaining Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration before the expiry of the ten day period referred to in paragraph 2. The original arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of obligations to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 30 days of the date of submission of the request. Obligations shall not be suspended until the original arbitration panel has notified its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the arbitration panel ruling.\n4.   The suspension of obligations and the compensation foreseen in this Article shall be temporary and shall not be applied after:\n(a)\nthe Parties have reached a mutually agreed solution pursuant to Article 398 of this Agreement;\n(b)\nthe Parties have agreed that the measure notified under Article 392(1) of this Agreement brings the Party complained against in conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement; or\n(c)\nany measure found to be inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it in conformity with those provisions, as ruled under Article 392(1) of this Agreement.\nArticle 394\nRemedies for urgent energy disputes\n1.   In respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related Energy) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil, or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, the provisions of this Article on remedies shall apply.\n2.   By way of derogation from Articles 391, 392, and 393 of this Agreement, the complaining Party may suspend obligations arising under Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement to a level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the Party failing to bring itself into compliance with the arbitration panel ruling within 15 days of its notification. That suspension may take effect immediately. Such suspension may be maintained as long as the Party complained against has not complied with the arbitration panel ruling.\n3.   Should the Party complained against dispute the existence of a failure to comply or the level of suspension due to the failure to comply, it may initiate proceedings under Articles 393(3) and 395 of this Agreement which shall be examined expeditiously. The complaining Party shall be required to remove or adjust the suspension only after the arbitration panel has ruled on the matter, and may maintain the suspension pending the proceedings.\nArticle 395\nReview of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies for non-compliance\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, of the measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel following the suspension of concessions or following the application of temporary compensation, as the case may be. With the exception of cases under paragraph 2 of this Article, the complaining Party shall terminate the suspension of concessions within 30 days from the receipt of the notification. In cases where compensation has been applied, and with the exception of cases under paragraph 2, the Party complained against may terminate the application of such compensation within 30 days from its notification that it has complied with the ruling of the arbitration panel.\n2.   If the Parties do not reach an agreement on whether the notified measure brings the Party complained against in conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notification, the complaining Party shall request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such a request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 45 days of the date of submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that the measure taken to comply is in accordance with the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement, the suspension of obligations or compensation, as the case may be, shall be terminated. Where relevant, the complaining Party shall adapt the level of suspension of concessions to the level determined by the arbitration panel.\nSub-section 3\nCommon provisions\nArticle 396\nReplacement of arbitrators\nIf in an arbitration proceeding under this Chapter, the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, are unable to participate, withdraw, or need to be replaced because they do not comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct set out in Annex XXXIV to this Agreement, the procedure set out in Article 385 of this Agreement shall apply. The time-limit for the notification of the arbitration panel ruling shall be extended for the time necessary for the appointment of a new arbitrator but for no more than 20 days.\nArticle 397\nSuspension and termination of arbitration and compliance procedures\nThe arbitration panel shall, at the written request of the Parties, suspend its work at any time for a period agreed by the Parties not exceeding 12 consecutive months.

The requesting Party shall inform the Chairperson of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, and the other Party, accordingly. If a Party does not request the resumption of the arbitration panel's work at the expiry of the agreed suspension period, the procedure shall be terminated.

They shall jointly notify the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, and the chairperson of the arbitration panel, where applicable, of any such solution. If the solution requires approval pursuant to the relevant domestic procedures of either Party, the notification shall refer to this requirement, and the dispute settlement procedure shall be suspended. If such approval is not required, or if the completion of any such domestic procedures is notified, the dispute settlement procedure shall be terminated.\nArticle 399\nRules of procedure\n1.

Any information obtained under this Article shall be disclosed to each of the Parties and submitted for their comments.\nArticle 401\nRules of interpretation\nThe arbitration panel shall interpret the provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including those codified in the Vienna Convention of 1969 on the Law of Treaties. The arbitration panel shall also take into account relevant interpretations established in reports of panels and of the Appellate Body adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The rulings of the arbitration panel cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties provided under this Agreement.\nArticle 402\nDecisions and rulings of the arbitration panel\n1.   The arbitration panel shall make every effort to take any decision by consensus. Where, nevertheless, a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter at issue shall be decided by majority vote. However, in no case shall dissenting opinions of arbitrators be disclosed.\n2.   The rulings of the arbitration panel shall be unconditionally accepted by the Parties. They shall not create any rights or obligations for natural or legal persons. The rulings shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions referred to in Article 381 of this Agreement, and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that they make. The Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, shall make the rulings of the arbitration panel publicly available in their entirety within 10 days of their notification, unless it decides not to do so in order to ensure the confidentiality of business confidential information.\nArticle 403\nReferrals to the Court of Justice of the European Union\n1.   The procedures set out in this Article shall apply to disputes concerning the interpretation and application of a provision of this Agreement relating to gradual approximation contained in Chapter 3 (Technical Barriers to Trade), Chapter 4 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), Chapter 5 (Customs and Trade Facilitation), Chapter 6 (Establishment, Trade in Services and Electronic Commerce), Chapter 8 (Public Procurement) or Chapter 10 (Competition) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement, or which otherwise imposes upon a Party an obligation defined by reference to a provision of Union law.\n2.   Where a dispute raises a question of interpretation of a provision of Union law referred to in paragraph 1, the arbitration panel shall not decide the question, but request the Court of Justice of the European Union to give a ruling on the question. In such cases, the deadlines applying to the rulings of the arbitration panel shall be suspended until the Court of Justice of the European Union has given its ruling. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be binding on the arbitration panel.\nSection 4\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 404\nLists of arbitrators\n1.

Recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall be without prejudice to any action in the WTO framework, including dispute settlement proceedings.\n2.   However, a Party shall not, for any particular measure, seek redress for a substantially equivalent obligation under both this Agreement and the WTO Agreement in both fora. In such case, once a dispute settlement proceeding has been initiated, the Party shall not bring a claim seeking redress for the breach of the substantially equivalent obligation under the other Agreement to the other forum, unless the forum selected first fails for procedural or jurisdictional reasons to make findings on the claim seeking redress of that obligation.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article:\n(a)\ndispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for the establishment of a panel under Article 6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes of the WTO; and\n(b)\ndispute settlement proceedings under this Chapter are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for the establishment of an arbitration panel under Article 384 of this Agreement.\n4.   Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from implementing the suspension of obligations authorised by the DSB. The WTO Agreement shall not be invoked to preclude a Party from suspending obligations under this Chapter.\nArticle 406\nTime-limits\n1.

The Union shall assess whether the legislation of the Republic of Moldova has been approximated to Union law and whether it is implemented and enforced effectively. The Republic of Moldova shall provide the Union with all necessary information to enable such assessment, in a language to be mutually agreed.\n3.   The assessment by the Union pursuant to paragraph 2 shall take into account the existence and operation of relevant infrastructure, bodies and procedures in the Republic of Moldova necessary for the effective implementation and enforcement of the legislation of the Republic of Moldova.\n4.   The assessment by the Union pursuant to paragraph 2 shall take account of the existence of any domestic provisions or practices that are inconsistent with Union law or with the domestic law approximated to the Union law in the trade-related areas of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement.\n5.   The Union shall inform the Republic of Moldova within 12 months from the start of the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 about the results of its assessment, unless otherwise provided.

Principles\n(a)\nEquivalence can be determined for an individual measure, or a group of measures, or a system related to a certain commodity, or a category of commodities or all of them;\n(b)\nThe examination by the importing Party of a request for recognition of equivalence of measures pertaining to a certain commodity of the exporting Party shall not be a reason to disrupt trade or suspend on-going imports from the exporting Party of the commodity in question;\n(c)\nThe process of recognition of equivalence of measures is an interactive process between the exporting Party and the importing Party. The process consists of an objective demonstration of equivalence of individual measures by the exporting Party and an objective assessment of the equivalence with a view to the possible recognition of equivalence by the importing Party;\n(d)\nThe final recognition of equivalence of the relevant measures of the exporting Party rests solely with the importing Party.\n2.   Preconditions\n(a)\nThe process depends on the health or pest status, the law and the effectiveness of the inspection and control system related to the commodity in the exporting Party. To this end the law in the sector concerned shall be taken into account, as well as the structure of the competent authority of the exporting Party, the command chain, the authority, the operational procedures and resources, and the effectiveness of the competent authorities as regards inspection and control systems, including the level of enforcement related to the commodity and the regularity and the rapidity of information flow to the importing Party in case of identified hazards. This recognition may be supported by documentation, verification and documents, reports and information related to past experiences, assessment and verifications;\n(b)\nThe Parties may initiate the process of recognition of equivalence pursuant to Article 183 of this Agreement after the successful completion of the regulatory approximation of a measure, a group of measures or a system included in the approximation list set out in Article 181(4) of this Agreement;\n(c)\nThe exporting Party shall only initiate the process when no safeguard measures imposed by the importing Party apply to the exporting Party as regards the commodity.\n3.   The process\n(a)\nThe exporting Party initiates the process by submitting to the importing Party a request for recognition of equivalence of an individual measure or groups of measures or a system for a commodity or a category of commodities in a sector or sub-sector or all of them;\n(b)\nWhen appropriate, this request includes also the request and the required documentation for approval by the importing Party on the basis of equivalence of any programme or plan of the exporting Party required by the importing Party and/or the status of approximation as laid down in Annex XXIV to this Agreement regarding the measures or systems described in point (a) of this paragraph as a condition for allowing import of that commodity or a category of commodities;\n(c)\nWith this request, the exporting Party:\n(i)\nexplains the importance for trade of that commodity or a category of commodities;\n(ii)\nidentifies the individual measure(s) with which it can comply from all the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party applicable to that commodity or a category of commodities;\n(iii)\nidentifies the individual measure(s) for which it seeks equivalence out of the total of the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party, applicable to that commodity or a category of commodities;\n(d)\nIn reply to this request the importing Party explains the overall and individual objective and the rationale behind its measure(s), including the identification of the risk;\n(e)\nWith this explanation, the importing Party informs the exporting Party on the relationship of its domestic measures and the import conditions for that commodity;\n(f)\nThe exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that the measures that it has identified are equivalent to the import conditions for that commodity or a category of commodities;\n(g)\nThe importing Party objectively assesses the demonstration of equivalence by the exporting Party;\n(h)\nThe importing Party concludes whether equivalence is achieved or not;\n(i)\nThe importing Party provides to the exporting Party full explanation and supporting data for its determination and decision if so required by the exporting Party;\n4.   Demonstration of equivalence of measures by the exporting party and assessment of this demonstration by the importing Party\n(a)\nThe exporting Party shall objectively demonstrate equivalence for each of the identified measures of the importing Party expressed in its import conditions. When appropriate, equivalence shall objectively be demonstrated for any plan or program required by the importing Party as a condition to allow import (e.g. residue plan);\n(b)\nObjective demonstration and assessment in this context should be based, as far as possible, on:\n—\ninternationally recognised standards; and/or standards based on proper scientific evidence; and/or\n—\nrisk assessment; and/or\n—\ndocuments, reports and information related to past experiences, assessments and verifications; and\n—\nlegal status or level of administrative status of the measures; and\n—\nlevel of implementation and enforcement on the basis of in particular:\n—\ncorresponding and relevant results of surveillance and monitoring programmes;\n—\ninspection results of the exporting Party;\n—\nresults of analysis with recognised analysis methods;\n—\nverification and import check results by the importing Party;\n—\nthe performance of the competent authorities of the exporting Party; and\n—\nearlier experiences.\n5.   Conclusions of the importing Party\nIn case the importing Party arrives at a negative conclusion, it shall provide the exporting Party with a detailed and reasoned explanation.\n6.   For plants and plant products, equivalence concerning phytosanitary measures, shall be based on the conditions referred into Article 183(6) of this Agreement.\nANNEX XXII\nIMPORT CHECKS AND INSPECTION FEES\nA.   Principles of import checks\nImport checks consist of documentary checks, identity checks and physical checks\nAs regards animals and animal products, the physical checks and their frequency shall be based on the level of the risk associated with such imports.\nIn carrying out the checks for plant health purposes, the importing Party shall ensure that the plants, plant products and other objects shall be meticulously inspected on an official basis, either in their entirety or by inspecting a representative sample, in order to make sure, that they are not contaminated by pests.\nIn the event that the checks reveal non-conformity with the relevant standards and/or requirements, the importing Party shall take official measures proportionate to the risk involved. Wherever possible, the importer or his representative shall be given access to the consignment and the opportunity to provide any relevant information to assist the importing Party in taking a final decision concerning the consignment.

objective of setting out practical measures aimed at preventing and rapidly reacting to an emergency situation or to a threat thereof. It foresees an early evaluation of potential risks and problems related to the supply and demand of natural gas, oil or electricity and the prevention and rapid reaction in case of an emergency situation or a threat thereof.\n2.\nFor the purposes of this Annex, an emergency situation is a situation causing a significant disruption or a physical interruption of supply of natural gas, oil or electricity between the Union and the Republic of Moldova.\n3.\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the Coordinators are the Minister of the Republic of Moldova in charge of Energy and the Member of the European Commission in charge of Energy.\n4.\nRegular evaluations of potential risks and problems related to the supply and demand of energy materials and products should be undertaken jointly by the Parties and reported to the Coordinators.\n5.\nShould one of the Parties become aware of an emergency situation or of a situation which, in its opinion, could lead to an emergency situation, that Party shall inform the other Party without delay.\n6.\nUnder the circumstances set out in paragraph 5, the Coordinators shall notify each other, within the shortest possible time, of the necessity to initiate the Early Warning Mechanism. The notification shall indicate, inter alia, designated persons that are authorised by the Coordinators to maintain permanent contact with each other.\n7.\nUpon notification in accordance with paragraph 6, each Party shall provide the other Party with its own assessment. Such an assessment shall include an estimate of the timeframe within which the emergency situation or the threat thereof could be eliminated. The Parties shall react promptly to the assessment provided by the other Party and complement it with available additional information.\n8.\nIf one Party is unable to adequately assess or accept the other Party's assessment of the situation, or the estimated timeframe within which an emergency situation or a threat thereof may be eliminated, the corresponding Coordinator may request consultations, which are to commence within a time period not exceeding 3 days from the moment of forwarding the notification provided for in paragraph 6. Such consultations shall take place through an Experts Group consisting of representatives authorised by the Coordinators. The consultations shall aim at:\n(a)\nelaborating a common evaluation of the situation and of possible further developments;\n(b)\nelaborating recommendations to overcome the emergency situation or to eliminate the threat thereof;\n(c)\nelaborating recommendations on a joint action plan in order to minimise the impact of an emergency situation and, if possible, to overcome the emergency situation, including the possibility of establishing a Special Monitoring Group.\n9.\nThe consultations, common evaluations and proposed recommendations shall be based on the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality.\n10.\nThe Coordinators, within their competencies, shall work to overcome the emergency situation or to eliminate the threat thereof taking into account the recommendations that have been elaborated as the result of the consultations.\n11.\nThe Experts Group referred to in paragraph 8 shall report on its activities to the Coordinators promptly after the implementation of any agreed plan of action.\n12.\nIf an emergency situation occurs, the Coordinators may establish a Special Monitoring Group with the task of examining the ongoing circumstances and development of events and keeping an objective record of them. The Special Monitoring Group shall consist of:\n(a)\nrepresentatives of both Parties;\n(b)\nrepresentatives of energy companies of the Parties;\n(c)\nrepresentatives of international energy organisations, proposed and mutually approved by the Parties;\n(d)\nindependent experts proposed and mutually approved by the Parties.\n13.\nThe Special Monitoring Group shall start its work without delay and shall operate, as necessary, until the emergency situation has been solved. A decision on the termination of the work of the Special Monitoring Group shall be taken jointly by the Coordinators.\n14.\nFrom the time at which a Party informs the other Party of the circumstances described in paragraph 5, and until the completion of the procedures set out in this Annex and the resolution of the emergency situation or the elimination of the threat thereof, the Parties will do their utmost to minimise negative consequences for the other Party. The Parties shall cooperate with the aim to reach an immediate solution in a spirit of transparency. The Parties shall refrain from any actions unrelated to the ongoing emergency situation that could create or deepen the negative consequences for the supply of natural gas, oil or electricity between the Union and the Republic of Moldova.\n15.\nEach Party independently carries the costs relating to the actions in the framework of this Annex.\n16.\nThe Parties shall maintain in confidence all information exchanged between them that is designated as being of a confidential nature. The Parties shall take any necessary measures to protect confidential information on the basis of the relevant legal and normative acts of the Republic of Moldova, or the Union and/or its Member States, as applicable, as well as in accordance with applicable international agreements and conventions.\n17.\nThe Parties may invite, by mutual agreement, representatives of third parties to take part in the consultations or monitoring referred to in paragraphs 8 and 12.\n18.\nThe Parties may agree to adapt the provisions of this Annex in view of establishing an Early Warning Mechanism between them and other Parties.\n19.\nA violation of the Early Warning Mechanism cannot serve as a basis for dispute settlement procedures under Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement. Moreover, a Party shall not rely on, or introduce as evidence in such dispute settlement procedures:\n(a)\npositions taken or proposals made by the other Party in the course of the procedure set out in this Annex; or\n(b)\nthe fact that the other Party has indicated its willingness to accept a solution to the emergency situation subject to the Early Warning Mechanism.\nANNEX XXXII\nMEDIATION MECHANISM\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThe objective of this Annex is to facilitate a mutually agreed solution through a comprehensive and expeditious procedure with the assistance of a mediator.\nSection 1\nProcedure under the Mediation Mechanism\nArticle 2\nRequest for information\n1.   Before the initiation of the mediation procedure, a Party may request, at any time, in writing, information regarding a measure adversely affecting trade or investment between the Parties. The Party to which such request is made shall provide, within 20 days, a written response containing its comments on the information contained in the request.\n2.   Where the responding Party considers that a response within 20 days is not practicable, it shall inform the requesting Party of the reasons for the delay, together with an estimate of the shortest period within which it will be able to provide its response.\nArticle 3\nInitiation of the procedure\n1.   A Party may request, at any time, that the Parties enter into a mediation procedure. Such request shall be addressed to the other Party in writing. The request shall be sufficiently detailed in order to clearly present the concerns of the requesting Party and shall:\n(a)\nidentify the specific measure at issue;\n(b)\nprovide a statement of the alleged adverse effects that the requesting Party believes the measure has, or will have, on trade or investment between the Parties; and\n(c)\nexplain how the requesting Party considers that those effects are linked to the measure.\n2.   The mediation procedure may only be initiated by mutual agreement of the Parties. The Party to which a request pursuant to paragraph 1 is addressed shall give sympathetic consideration to the request and reply by accepting or rejecting it in writing within 10 days of its receipt.\nArticle 4\nSelection of the mediator\n1.   Upon the launch of the mediation procedure, the Parties shall endeavour to agree on a mediator no later than 15 days after the receipt of the reply to the request referred to in Article 3 of this Annex.\n2.   In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on the mediator within the time frame laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article, either Party may request the chair or co-chairs of the Association Committee in Trade configuration as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, or their delegates, to select the mediator, by drawing lots, from the list established under Article 404(1) of this Agreement. Representatives of both Parties shall be invited, with sufficient advance notice, to be present when the lots are drawn. In any event, the drawing of lots shall be carried out with the Party/Parties that is/are present.\n3.   The chair or co-chairs of the Association Committee in Trade configuration as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, or their delegates, shall select the mediator within five working days of the request made under paragraph 2 of this Article by either Party.\n4.   Should the list referred to in Article 404(1) of this Agreement not be established at the time a request is made pursuant to Article 3 of this Annex, the mediator shall be selected, by drawing lots, from the individuals which have been formally proposed by one or both of the Parties.\n5.   A mediator shall not be a citizen of either Party, unless the Parties agree otherwise.\n6.

Within 10 days after the appointment of the mediator, the Party having invoked the mediation procedure shall present, in writing, a detailed description of the problem to the mediator and to the other Party, in particular of the operation of the measure at issue and its trade effects. Within 20 days after the date of delivery of this description, the other Party may provide, in writing, its comments on the description of the problem. Either Party may include in its description or comments any information that it deems relevant.\n2.   The mediator may decide on the most appropriate way of bringing clarity to the measure concerned and its possible trade effects. In particular, the mediator may organise meetings between the Parties, consult the Parties jointly or individually, seek the assistance of, or consult with, relevant experts and stakeholders and provide any additional support requested by the Parties. However, before seeking the assistance of, or consulting with, relevant experts and stakeholders, the mediator shall consult with the Parties.\n3.   The mediator may offer advice and propose a solution for the consideration of the Parties. The Parties may accept or reject the proposed solution or agree on a different solution. However, the mediator shall not advise or give comments on the consistency of the measure at issue with this Agreement.\n4.   The mediation procedure shall take place in the territory of the Party to which the request was addressed, or by mutual agreement in any other location or by any other means.\n5.   The Parties shall endeavour to reach a mutually agreed solution within 60 days from the appointment of the mediator. Pending a final agreement, the Parties may consider possible interim solutions, especially if the measure relates to perishable goods.\n6.   The solution may be adopted by means of a decision of the Association Committee in Trade configuration as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement. Either Party may make such a solution subject to the completion of any necessary internal procedures. Mutually agreed solutions shall be made publicly available. The version disclosed to the public may not contain any information that a Party has designated as confidential.\n7.   On request of the Parties, the mediator shall issue to the Parties, in writing, a draft factual report, providing a brief summary of the measure at issue in these procedures, the procedures followed, and any mutually agreed solution reached as the final outcome of these procedures, including possible interim solutions. The mediator shall allow the Parties 15 days to comment on the draft report. After considering the comments of the Parties submitted within that period, the mediator shall submit, in writing, a final factual report to the Parties within 15 days. The factual report shall not include any interpretation of this Agreement.\n8.   The procedure shall be terminated:\n(a)\nby the adoption of a mutually agreed solution by the Parties, on the date of its adoption;\n(b)\nby mutual agreement of the Parties at any stage of the procedure, on the date of that agreement;\n(c)\nby a written declaration of the mediator, after consultation with the Parties, that further efforts at mediation would be to no avail, on the date of that declaration; or\n(d)\nby a written declaration of a Party after exploring mutually agreed solutions under the mediation procedure and after having considered any advice and proposed solutions by the mediator, on the date of that declaration.\nSection 2\nImplementation\nArticle 6\nImplementation of a mutually agreed solution\n1.   Where the Parties have reached agreement on a solution, each Party shall take the measures necessary to implement the mutually agreed solution within the agreed timeframe.\n2.   The implementing Party shall inform the other Party in writing of any steps or measures taken to implement the mutually agreed solution.\nSection 3\nGeneral Provisions\nArticle 7\nConfidentiality and relationship to dispute settlement\n1.   Unless the Parties agree otherwise, and without prejudice to Article 5(6) of this Annex, all steps of the procedure, including any advice or proposed solution, are confidential. However, any Party may disclose to the public the fact that mediation is taking place.\n2.   The mediation procedure is without prejudice to the Parties' rights and obligations under the provisions on Dispute Settlement of Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement or any other agreement.\n3.   Consultations under Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement are not required before initiating the mediation procedure. However, a Party should normally avail itself of the other cooperation or consultation provisions provided for in this Agreement before initiating the mediation procedure.\n4.   A Party shall not rely on or introduce as evidence in other dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement or any other agreement, nor shall a panel take into consideration:\n(a)\npositions taken by the other Party in the course of the mediation procedure or information gathered under Articles 5(1) and 5(2) of this Annex;\n(b)\nthe fact that the other Party has indicated its willingness to accept a solution to the measure subject to mediation; or\n(c)\nadvice given or proposals made by the mediator.\n5.   A mediator may not serve as member of a panel in a dispute settlement proceeding under this Agreement or under the WTO Agreement involving the same matter for which he/she has been a mediator.\nArticle 8\nTime limits\nAny time limit referred to in this Annex may be modified by mutual agreement between the Parties involved in the mediation procedures.\nArticle 9\nCosts\n1.

Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials originating in the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 while it shall not be necessary that the materials of the other Party have undergone sufficient working or processing.\nArticle 4\nWholly obtained products\n1.   The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in a Party:\n(a)\nmineral products extracted from its soil or from its seabed;\n(b)\nvegetable products harvested there;\n(c)\nlive animals born and raised there;\n(d)\nproducts from live animals raised there;\n(e)\nproducts obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;\n(f)\nproducts of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the exporting Party by its vessels;\n(g)\nproducts made aboard its factory ships exclusively from products referred to in point (f);\n(h)\nused articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;\n(i)\nwaste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n(j)\nproducts extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside its territorial waters provided that it has sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;\n(k)\ngoods produced there exclusively from the products specified in points (a) to (j).\n2.

It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex II to this Protocol, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:\n(a)\ntheir total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;\n(b)\nany of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded by virtue of this paragraph.\nThis paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.\n3.

Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line shall be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.\n3.   The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 5, a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Member State of the European Union or of the Republic of Moldova if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the European Union or in the Republic of Moldova and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n5.   The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.\n6.   The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.\n7.   A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.\nArticle 17\nMovement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively\n1.   Notwithstanding Article 16(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:\n(a)\nit was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or\n(b)\nit is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.\n2.   For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.\n3.   The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application complies with that in the corresponding file.\n4.   Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase in English:\n‘ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY’\n5.   The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the movement certificate EUR.1.\nArticle 18\nIssue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1\n1.   In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.\n2.   The duplicate issued in this way shall be endorsed with the following word in English:\n‘DUPLICATE’\n3.   The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.\n4.   The duplicate, which shall bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.\nArticle 19\nIssue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously\nWhen originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in a Party, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within that Party. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.\nArticle 20\nAccounting segregation\n1.   Where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called ‘accounting segregation’ method (hereinafter referred to as the ‘method’) to be used for managing such stocks.\n2.   The method shall ensure that, for a specific reference period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as ‘originating’ is the same as that which would have been obtained had there been physical segregation of the stocks.\n3.   The customs authorities may make the grant of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions deemed appropriate.\n4.   The method shall be applied and the application thereof shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured.\n5.   The beneficiary of the method may make out or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.\n6.   The customs authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation and may withdraw it whenever the beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.\nArticle 21\nConditions for making out an origin declaration\n1.   An origin declaration as referred to in Article 15(1)(b) may be made out:\n(a)\nby an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 22; or\n(b)\nby any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products the total value of which does not exceed EUR 6 000.\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3, an origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the European Union or in the Republic of Moldova and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n3.   The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n4.   An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV to this Protocol, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink, in printed characters.\n5.   Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 22 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.\n6.   An origin declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country at the latest two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.\nArticle 22\nApproved exporter\n1.   The customs authorities of the exporting Party may authorise any exporter (hereinafter referred to as ‘approved exporter’), who makes frequent shipments of products in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol, to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation shall offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.\n3.   The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.\n4.   The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.\n5.   The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes incorrect use of the authorisation.\nArticle 23\nValidity of proof of origin\n1.   A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting Party, and shall be submitted within that period to the customs authorities of the importing Party.\n2.   Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.\n3.   In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.\nArticle 24\nSubmission of proof of origin\nProofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this Agreement.\nArticle 25\nImportation by instalments\nWhere, at the request of the importer and subject to the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.\nArticle 26\nExemptions from proof of origin\n1.   Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, that declaration may be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.\n2.   Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.\n3.   Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.\nArticle 27\nSupporting documents\nThe documents referred to in Articles 16(3) and 21(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an origin declaration may be considered as products originating in a Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist, inter alia, of the following:\n(a)\ndirect evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal bookkeeping;\n(b)\ndocuments proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the relevant Party where these documents are used in accordance with national law;\n(c)\ndocuments proving the working or processing of materials in the relevant Party, issued or made out in the relevant Party, where these documents are used in accordance with national law;\n(d)\nmovement certificates EUR.1 or origin declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the relevant Party in accordance with this Protocol;\n(e)\nappropriate evidence concerning working or processing undergone outside the relevant Party by application of Article 11, proving that the requirements of that Article have been satisfied.\nArticle 28\nPreservation of proof of origin and supporting documents\n1.   The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the documents referred to in Article 16(3).\n2.   The exporter making out an origin declaration shall keep for at least three years a copy of this origin declaration as well as the documents referred to in Article 21(3).\n3.   The customs authorities of the exporting Party issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in Article 16(2).\n4.   The customs authorities of the importing Party shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the origin declarations submitted to them.\nArticle 29\nDiscrepancies and formal errors\n1.   The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the document submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not, ipso facto, render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.\n2.   Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin shall not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.\nArticle 30\nAmounts expressed in euro\n1.   For the application of the provisions of Article 21(1)(b) and Article 26(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Parties equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.\n2.   A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 21(1)(b) or Article 26(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.\n3.   The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.\n4.   A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion were to result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n5.   The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Customs Sub-Committee at the request of any Party. When carrying out this review, the Customs Sub-Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.\nTITLE VI\nARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nArticle 31\nAdministrative cooperation\n1.   The customs authorities of the Parties shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1, and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and origin declarations.\n2.   In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Parties shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1, the origin declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.\nArticle 32\nVerification of proofs of origin\n1.   Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing Party shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the origin declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the request for verification. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.\n3.   The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.\n4.   If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.\n5.   The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results thereof as soon as possible. These results shall indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned may be considered as products originating in a Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n6.   If, in cases of reasonable doubt, there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.\nArticle 33\nDispute settlement\n1.   Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures provided for in Article 32 of this Protocol which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, those disputes shall be submitted to the Association Committee in Trade configuration as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement. Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement shall not apply.\n2.   Where disputes other than those related to the verification procedures provided for in Article 32 of this Protocol arise in relation to the interpretation of this Protocol, those disputes shall be submitted to the Customs Sub-Committee. A dispute settlement proceeding under Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title V (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement may only be initiated, if the Customs Sub-Committee has failed to resolve the dispute within six months from the date on which the dispute was submitted to the Customs Sub-Committee.\n3.   In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing Party shall take place under the legislation of that Party.\nArticle 34\nPenalties\nPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.\nArticle 35\nFree zones\n1.   The Parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin, which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, when products originating in a Party are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone complies with this Protocol.\nTITLE VII\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\nArticle 36\nApplication of this Protocol\n1.   The term ‘European Union’ does not cover Ceuta and Melilla.\n2.   Products originating in the Republic of Moldova, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the European Union under Protocol 2 to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Communities. The Republic of Moldova shall grant to imports of products covered by this Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the European Union.\n3.   For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 of this Article with regard to products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 37.\nArticle 37\nSpecial conditions\n1.   Provided that they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, the following shall be considered as:\n(1)\nproducts originating in Ceuta and Melilla:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in Ceuta and Melilla, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that:\n(i)\nthose products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5;\nor that\n(ii)\nthose products originated in a Party, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6;\n(2)\nproducts originating in the Republic of Moldova:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in the Republic of Moldova;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in the Republic of Moldova, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that:\n(i)\nthe said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5;\nor that\n(ii)\nthose products originated in Ceuta and Melilla or in the European Union, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6.\n2.   Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.\n3.   The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter ‘Republic of Moldova’ and ‘Ceuta and Melilla’ in Box 2 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on origin declarations. In addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in Box 4 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on origin declarations.\n4.   The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.\nTITLE VIII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 38\nAmendments to this Protocol\nThe Customs Sub-Committee may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.\nArticle 39\nTransitional provisions for goods in transit or storage\nThe provisions of this Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Protocol and which on the date of entry into force of this Agreement are either in transit, in the Parties, in temporary storage in customs warehouses or in free zones, subject to the submission to the customs authorities of the importing Party, within four months of that date, of a proof of origin made out retrospectively together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly in accordance with Article 12.\nANNEX I TO PROTOCOL II\nINTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II TO PROTOCOL II\nNote 1:\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol.\nNote 2:\n2.1.\nThe first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ‘ex’, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n2.2.\nWhere several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.\n2.3.\nWhere there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.\n2.4.\nWhere, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.\nNote 3:\n3.1.\nThe provisions of Article 5 of this Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.\nExample:\nAn engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging’ of heading ex ex 7224.\nIf this forging has been forged in the European Union from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the European Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.\n3.2.\nThe rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\n3.3.\nWithout prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading’, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.\nHowever, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.\n3.4.\nWhen a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\nExample:\nThe rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.\n3.5.\nWhere a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).\nExample:\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.\nHowever, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\nExample:\nIn the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth — even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn — that is, the fibre stage.\n3.6.\nWhere, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.\nNote 4:\n4.1.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.\n4.2.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.\n4.3.\nThe terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n4.4.\nThe term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.\nNote 5:\n5.1.\nWhere, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4).\n5.2.\nHowever, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n—\nsilk,\n—\nwool,\n—\ncoarse animal hair,\n—\nfine animal hair,\n—\nhorsehair,\n—\ncotton,\n—\npaper-making materials and paper,\n—\nflax,\n—\ntrue hemp,\n—\njute and other textile bast fibres,\n—\nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,\n—\ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,\n—\nsynthetic man-made filaments,\n—\nartificial man-made filaments,\n—\ncurrent-conducting filaments,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),\n—\nother synthetic man-made staple fibres,\n—\nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n—\nother artificial man-made staple fibres,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,\n—\nproducts of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,\n—\nother products of heading 5605.\nExample:\nA yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.\nExample:\nA woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.\nExample:\nTufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\nExample:\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.\n5.3.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.\n5.4.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.\nNote 6:\n6.1.\nWhere, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.\n6.2.\nWithout prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.\nExample:\nIf a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\n6.3.\nWhere a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\nNote 7:\n7.1.\nFor the purposes of headings ex ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex ex 2901, ex ex 2902 and ex ex 3403, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation.\n7.2.\nFor the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation;\n(j)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n(k)\nin respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n(l)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n(m)\nin respect of fuel oils of heading ex ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;\n(n)\nin respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;\n(o)\nin respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.\n7.3.\nFor the purposes of headings ex ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex ex 2901, ex ex 2902 and ex ex 3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.\nANNEX II TO PROTOCOL II\nLIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER FOR THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED TO OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS\nThe products mentioned in the list may not be all covered by this Agreement.
