{"celex_id": "32008L0106", "reference": "3.12.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 323/33\nDIRECTIVE 2008/106/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 19 November 2008\non the minimum level of training of seafarers (recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2001/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the minimum level of training of seafarers (3) has been significantly amended on several occasions (4). Now that new amendments are being made to that Directive, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity, that the provisions in question should be recast.\n(2)\nActions to be taken at Community level in the field of maritime safety and pollution prevention at sea should be in line with internationally agreed rules and standards.\n(3)\nIn order to maintain and develop the level of knowledge and skills in the maritime sector in the Community, it is important to pay appropriate attention to maritime training and the status of seafarers in the Community.\n(4)\nA consistent level of training for the award of vocational competency certificates to seafarers should be ensured in the interests of maritime safety.\n(5)\nDirective 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications (5) applies to maritime occupations covered by this Directive. It will help promote compliance with the obligations laid down in the Treaty abolishing obstacles to the free movement of persons and services between Member States.\n(6)\nThe mutual recognition of diplomas and certificates provided for under Directive 2005/36/EC does not always ensure a standardised level of training for all seafarers serving on board vessels flying the flag of a Member State. This is, however, vital from the viewpoint of maritime safety.\n(7)\nIt is therefore essential to define a minimum level of training for seafarers in the Community. That level should be based on the standards of training already agreed at international level, namely the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW Convention), as revised in 1995. All Member States are Parties to that Convention.\n(8)\nMember States may establish standards higher than the minimum standards laid down in the STCW Convention and this Directive.\n(9)\nThe Regulations of the STCW Convention annexed to this Directive should be supplemented by the mandatory provisions contained in Part A of the Seafarers’ Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code (STCW Code). Part B of the STCW Code contains recommended guidance intended to assist Parties to the STCW Convention and those involved in implementing, applying or enforcing its measures to give the Convention full and complete effect in a uniform manner.\n(10)\nFor the enhancement of maritime safety and pollution prevention at sea, provisions on minimum rest periods for watchkeeping personnel should be established in this Directive in accordance with the STCW Convention. Those provisions should be applied without prejudice to the provisions of Council Directive 1999/63/EC of 21 June 1999 concerning the Agreement on the organisation of working time of seafarers concluded by the European Community Shipowners’ Association (ECSA) and the Federation of Transport Workers’ Unions in the European Union (FST) (6).\n(11)\nMember States should take and enforce specific measures to prevent and penalise fraudulent practices associated with certificates of competency as well as pursue their efforts within the IMO to achieve strict and enforceable agreements on the worldwide combating of such practices.\n(12)\nIn order to enhance maritime safety and prevent loss of human life and maritime pollution, communication among crew members on board ships sailing in Community waters should be improved.\n(13)\nPersonnel on board passenger ships nominated to assist passengers in emergency situations should be able to communicate with the passengers.\n(14)\nCrews serving on board tankers carrying noxious or polluting cargo should be capable of coping effectively with accident prevention and emergency situations. It is paramount that a proper communication link between the master, officers and ratings is established, covering the requirements provided for in this Directive.\n(15)\nIt is essential to ensure that seafarers holding certificates issued by third countries and serving on board Community ships have a level of competence equivalent to that required by the STCW Convention. This Directive should lay down procedures and common criteria for the recognition by the Member States of certificates issued by third countries, based on the training and certification requirements as agreed in the framework of the STCW Convention.\n(16)\nIn the interests of safety at sea, Member States should recognise qualifications proving the required level of training only where these are issued by or on behalf of Parties to the STCW Convention which have been identified by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) as having been shown to have given, and still to be giving, full effect to the standards set out in that Convention. To bridge the time gap until the MSC has been able to carry out such identification, a procedure for the preliminary recognition of certificates is needed.\n(17)\nWhere appropriate, maritime institutes, training programmes and courses should be inspected. Criteria for such inspection should therefore be established.\n(18)\nThe Commission should be assisted by a committee in carrying out the tasks related to the recognition of certificates issued by training institutes or administrations of third countries.\n(19)\nThe European Maritime Safety Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) should assist the Commission in verifying that Member States comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive.\n(20)\nMember States, as port authorities, are required to enhance safety and prevention of pollution in Community waters through priority inspection of vessels flying the flag of a third country which has not ratified the STCW Convention, thereby ensuring no more favourable treatment to vessels flying the flag of a third country.\n(21)\nIt is appropriate to include in this Directive provisions on port State control, pending the amendment of Council Directive 95/21/EC (8) on port State control of shipping in order to transfer to that Directive the provisions on port State control which are included in this Directive.\n(22)\nIt is necessary to provide for procedures for adapting this Directive to changes in international conventions and codes.\n(23)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9).\n(24)\nIn particular the Commission should be empowered to amend this Directive in order to apply, for the purposes of this Directive, subsequent amendments to certain international codes and any relevant amendment to Community legislation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(25)\nThe new elements introduced into this Directive only concern the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States.\n(26)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Members States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex III, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n1.\n‘master’ means the person having command of a ship;\n2.\n‘officer’ means a member of the crew, other than the master, designated as such by national law or regulations or, in the absence of such designation, by collective agreement or custom;\n3.\n‘deck officer’ means an officer qualified in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Annex I;\n4.\n‘chief mate’ means the officer next in rank to the master upon whom the command of the ship will fall in the event of the incapacity of the master;\n5.\n‘engineer officer’ means an officer qualified in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III of Annex I;\n6.\n‘chief engineer officer’ means the senior engineer officer responsible for the mechanical propulsion and the operation and maintenance of the mechanical and electrical installations of the ship;\n7.\n‘second engineer officer’ means the engineer officer next in rank to the chief engineer officer upon whom the responsibility for the mechanical propulsion and the operation and maintenance of the mechanical and electrical installations of the ship will fall in the event of the incapacity of the chief engineer officer;\n8.\n‘assistant engineer officer’ means a person under training to become an engineer officer and designated as such by national law or regulations;\n9.\n‘radio operator’ means a person holding an appropriate certificate issued or recognised by the competent authorities under the provisions of the Radio Regulations;\n10.\n‘rating’ means a member of the ship’s crew other than the master or an officer;\n11.\n‘seagoing ship’ means a ship other than those which navigate exclusively in inland waters or in waters within, or closely adjacent to, sheltered waters or areas where port regulations apply;\n12.\n‘ship flying the flag of a Member State’ means a ship registered in and flying the flag of a Member State in accordance with its legislation;

When defining near-coastal voyages Member States shall not impose training, experience or certification requirements on seafarers serving on board ships entitled to fly the flag of another Member State or another Party to the STCW Convention and engaged in such voyages in a manner resulting in more stringent requirements for such seafarers than for seafarers serving on board ships entitled to fly their own flag. In no case shall a Member State impose requirements in respect of seafarers serving on board ships flying the flag of another Member State or of another Party to the STCW Convention in excess of those of this Directive in respect of ships not engaged in near-coastal voyages.\n2.   With respect to ships entitled to fly the flag of a Member State regularly engaged in near-coastal voyages off the coast of another Member State or of another Party to the STCW Convention, the Member State the flag of which a ship is entitled to fly shall prescribe training, experience and certification requirements for seafarers serving on such ships at least equal to those of the Member State or the Party to the STCW Convention off the coast of which the ship is engaged, provided that they do not exceed the requirements of this Directive in respect of ships not engaged in near-coastal voyages. Seafarers serving on a ship which extends its voyage beyond what is defined as a near-coastal voyage by a Member State and enters waters not covered by that definition shall fulfil the appropriate requirements of this Directive.\n3.   A Member State may afford a ship which is entitled to fly its flag the benefits of the near-coastal voyage provisions of this Directive when it is regularly engaged off the coast of a non-Party to the STCW Convention on near-coastal voyages as defined by that Member State.\n4.   Upon deciding on the definition of near-coastal voyages and the conditions of education and training required thereof in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, Member States shall communicate to the Commission the details of the provisions they have adopted.\nArticle 8\nPrevention of fraud and other unlawful practices\n1.   Member States shall take and enforce the appropriate measures to prevent fraud and other unlawful practices involving the certification process or certificates issued and endorsed by their competent authorities, and shall provide for penalties that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n2.   Member States shall designate the national authorities competent to detect and combat fraud and other unlawful practices and exchange information with the competent authorities of other Member States and of third countries concerning the certification of seafarers.\nMember States shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission of the details of such competent national authorities.\nMember States shall also forthwith inform any third countries with which they have entered into an undertaking in accordance with Regulation I/10, paragraph 1.2 of the STCW Convention of the details of such competent national authorities.\n3.   At the request of a host Member State, the competent authorities of another Member State shall provide written confirmation or denial of the authenticity of seafarers’ certificates, corresponding endorsements or any other documentary evidence of training issued in that other Member State.\nArticle 9\nPenalties or disciplinary measures\n1.   Member States shall establish processes and procedures for the impartial investigation of any reported incompetence, act or omission, that may pose a direct threat to safety of life or property at sea or to the marine environment, on the part of the holders of certificates or endorsements issued by that Member State in connection with their performance of duties relating to their certificates and for the withdrawal, suspension and cancellation of such certificates for such cause and for the prevention of fraud.\n2.   Each Member State shall prescribe penalties or disciplinary measures for cases in which the provisions of this national legislation giving effect to this Directive are not complied with in respect of ships entitled to fly its flag or of seafarers duly certificated by it.\n3.   In particular, such penalties or disciplinary measures shall be prescribed and enforced in cases in which:\n(a)\na company or a master has engaged a person not holding a certificate as required by this Directive;\n(b)\na master has allowed any function or service in any capacity which under this Directive must be performed by a person holding an appropriate certificate to be performed by a person not holding the required certificate, a valid dispensation or having the documentary proof required by Article 19(7); or\n(c)\na person has obtained by fraud or forged documents an engagement to perform any function or serve in any capacity which under this Directive must be performed or fulfilled by a person holding a certificate or dispensation.\n4.   Member States within the jurisdiction of which any company which or any person who is believed on clear grounds to have been responsible for or to have knowledge of any apparent non-compliance with this Directive specified in paragraph 3, is located shall extend cooperation to any Member State or other Party to the STCW Convention which advises them of its intention to initiate proceedings under its jurisdiction.\nArticle 10\nQuality standards\n1.   Each Member State shall ensure that:\n(a)\nall training, assessment of competence, certification, endorsement and revalidation activities carried out by non-governmental agencies or entities under its authority are continuously monitored through a quality standards system to ensure the achievement of defined objectives, including those concerning the qualifications and experience of instructors and assessors;\n(b)\nwhere governmental agencies or entities perform such activities, there is a quality-standards system;\n(c)\nthe education and training objectives and related quality standards of competence to be achieved are clearly defined and identify the levels of knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to the examinations and assessments required under the STCW Convention;\n(d)\nthe fields of application of the quality standards cover the administration of the certification systems, all training courses and programmes, examinations and assessments carried out by or under the authority of each Member State and the qualifications and experience required of instructors and assessors, having regard to the policies, systems, controls and internal quality-assurance reviews established to ensure achievement of the defined objectives.\nThe objectives and related quality standards referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph may be specified separately for different courses and training programmes and shall cover the administration of the certification system.\n2.   Member States shall also ensure that independent evaluations of the knowledge, understanding, skills and competence acquisition and assessment activities, and of the administration of the certification system, are conducted at intervals of not more than five years by qualified persons who are not themselves involved in the activities concerned in order to verify that:\n(a)\nall internal management control and monitoring measures and follow-up actions comply with planned arrangements and documental procedures and are effective in ensuring that the defined objectives are achieved;\n(b)\nthe results of each independent evaluation are documented and brought to the attention of those responsible for the area evaluated;\n(c)\ntimely action is taken to correct deficiencies.\n3.   A report relating to each evaluation carried out pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be communicated by the Member State concerned to the Commission within six months of the date of the evaluation.\nArticle 11\nMedical standards — issue and registration of certificates\n1.   Member States shall establish standards of medical fitness for seafarers, particularly regarding eyesight and hearing.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that certificates are issued only to candidates who comply with the requirements of this Article.\n3.   Each candidate for certification shall provide satisfactory proof:\n(a)\nof his or her identity;\n(b)\nthat his or her age is not less than that prescribed in the Regulations in Annex I relevant to the certificate applied for;\n(c)\nthat he or she meets the standards of medical fitness, particularly regarding eyesight and hearing, established by the Member State and holds a valid document attesting to his or her medical fitness, issued by a duly qualified medical practitioner recognised by the competent authority of the Member State;\n(d)\nof having completed the seagoing service and any related compulsory training prescribed in the Regulations in Annex I for the certificate applied for;\n(e)\nthat he or she meets the standards of competence prescribed in the Regulations in Annex I for the capacities, functions and levels that are to be identified in the endorsement to the certificate.\n4.   Each Member State shall undertake:\n(a)\nto maintain a register or registers of all certificates and endorsements for masters and officers and, as appropriate, ratings, which are issued, have expired or have been revalidated, suspended, cancelled or reported lost or destroyed and of dispensations issued;\n(b)\nto make available information on the status of such certificates, endorsements and dispensations to other Member States or other Parties to the STCW Convention and companies which request verification of the authenticity and validity of certificates produced to them by seafarers seeking recognition of their certificates or employment on board ship.\nArticle 12\nRevalidation of certificates\n1.   Every master, officer and radio operator holding a certificate issued or recognised under any chapter of Annex I other than Chapter VI who is serving at sea or intends to return to sea after a period ashore shall, in order to continue to qualify for seagoing service, be required at intervals not exceeding five years:\n(a)\nto meet the standards of medical fitness prescribed by Article 11; and\n(b)\nto establish continued professional competence in accordance with section A-I/11 of the STCW Code.\n2.   Every master, officer and radio operator shall, for continuing seagoing service on board ships for which special training requirements have been internationally agreed upon, successfully complete approved relevant training.\n3.   Each Member State shall compare the standards of competence which are required of candidates for certificates issued before 1 February 2002 with those specified for the appropriate certificate in Part A of the STCW Code, and shall determine the need to require the holders of such certificates to undergo appropriate refresher and updating training or assessment.\nRefresher and updating courses shall be approved and include changes in relevant national and international regulations concerning the safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment and take account of any updating of the standard of competency concerned.\n4.   Each Member State shall, in consultation with those concerned, formulate or promote the formulation of a structure of refresher and updating courses as provided for in section A-I/11 of the STCW Code.\n5.   For the purpose of updating the knowledge of masters, officers and radio operators, each Member State shall ensure that the texts of recent changes in national and international regulations concerning the safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment are made available to ships entitled to fly its flag.\nArticle 13\nUse of simulators\n1.   The performance standards and other provisions set out in section A-I/12 of the STCW Code and such other requirements as are prescribed in Part A of the STCW Code for any certificate concerned shall be complied with in respect of:\n(a)\nall mandatory simulator-based training;\n(b)\nany assessment of competence required by Part A of the STCW Code which is carried out by means of a simulator;\n(c)\nany demonstration, by means of a simulator, of continued proficiency required by Part A of the STCW Code.\n2.   Simulators installed or brought into use before 1 February 2002 may be exempted from full compliance with the performance standards referred to in paragraph 1 at the discretion of each Member State.\nArticle 14\nResponsibilities of companies\n1.   In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 Member States shall hold companies responsible for the assignment of seafarers for service in their ships in accordance with this Directive, and shall require every company to ensure that:\n(a)\neach seafarer assigned to any of its ships holds an appropriate certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Directive and as established by the Member State;\n(b)\nits ships are manned in accordance with the applicable safe-manning requirements of the Member State;\n(c)\ndocumentation and data relevant to all seafarers employed on its ships are maintained and readily accessible, and include, without being limited to, documentation and data on their experience, training, medical fitness and competence in assigned duties;\n(d)\non being assigned to any of its ships seafarers are familiarised with their specific duties and with all ship arrangements, installations, equipment, procedures, and ship characteristics that are relevant to their routine or emergency duties;\n(e)\nthe ship’s complement can effectively coordinate their activities in an emergency situation and in performing functions vital to safety or to the prevention or mitigation of pollution.\n2.   Companies, masters and crew members shall each have responsibility for ensuring that the obligations set out in this Article are given full and complete effect and that such other measures as may be necessary are taken to ensure that each crew member can make a knowledgeable and informed contribution to the safe operation of the ship.\n3.   The company shall provide written instructions to the master of each ship to which this Directive applies, setting out the policies and the procedures to be followed to ensure that all seafarers who are newly employed on board the ship are given a reasonable opportunity to become familiar with the shipboard equipment, operating procedures and other arrangements needed for the proper performance of their duties, before being assigned to those duties. Such policies and procedures shall include:\n(a)\nthe allocation of a reasonable period of time during which each newly employed seafarer will have an opportunity to become acquainted with:\n(i)\nthe specific equipment the seafarer will be using or operating; and\n(ii)\nship-specific watchkeeping, safety, environmental protection and emergency procedures and arrangements the seafarer needs to know to perform the assigned duties properly;\n(b)\nthe designation of a knowledgeable crew member who will be responsible for ensuring that each newly employed seafarer is given an opportunity to receive essential information in a language the seafarer understands.\nArticle 15\nFitness for duty\n1.   For the purpose of preventing fatigue, Member States shall establish and enforce rest periods for watchkeeping personnel and require that watch systems are arranged in such a way that the efficiency of watchkeeping personnel is not impaired by fatigue and that duties are organised in such a way that the first watch at the start of a voyage and subsequent relieving watches are sufficiently rested and otherwise fit for duty.\n2.   All persons who are assigned duty as officer in charge of a watch or as a rating forming part of a watch shall be allowed at least 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period.\n3.   The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least six hours long.\n4.   The requirements for rest periods laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 need not be maintained in the event of an emergency or drill or in other overriding operational conditions.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, the minimum period of 10 hours may be reduced to not less than 6 consecutive hours provided that no such reduction shall extend beyond 2 days and at least 70 hours of rest are provided each 7-day period.\n6.   Member States shall require that watch schedules be posted where they are easily accessible.\nArticle 16\nDispensation\n1.   In circumstances of exceptional necessity, competent authorities may, if in their opinion this does not cause danger to persons, property or the environment, issue a dispensation permitting a specified seafarer to serve in a specified ship for a specified period not exceeding six months in a capacity, other than that of the radio operator, except as provided by the relevant Radio Regulations, for which he or she does not hold the appropriate certificate, provided that the person to whom the dispensation is issued shall be adequately qualified to fill the vacant post in a safe manner to the satisfaction of the competent authorities. However, dispensations shall not be granted to a master or chief engineer officer, except in circumstances of force majeure and then only for the shortest possible period.\n2.   Any dispensation granted for a post shall be granted only to a person properly certificated to fill the post immediately below. Where certification of the post below is not required, a dispensation may be issued to a person whose qualification and experience are, in the opinion of the competent authorities, of a clear equivalence to the requirements for the post to be filled, provided that, if such a person holds no appropriate certificate, he or she shall be required to pass a test accepted by the competent authorities as demonstrating that such a dispensation may safely be issued. In addition, the competent authorities shall ensure that the post in question is filled by the holder of an appropriate certificate as soon as possible.\nArticle 17\nResponsibilities of Member States with regard to training and assessment\n1.   Member States shall designate the authorities or bodies which shall:\n(a)\ngive the training referred to in Article 3;\n(b)\norganise and/or supervise the examinations where required;\n(c)\nissue the certificates of competence referred to in Article 11;\n(d)\ngrant the dispensations provided for in Article 16.\n2.

Seafarers who do not possess the certificates referred to in Article 4 may be allowed to serve on ships flying the flag of a Member State, provided that a decision on the recognition of their appropriate certificates has been adopted through the procedure set out in paragraphs 2 to 6 of this Article.\n2.   A Member State which intends to recognise, by endorsement, appropriate certificates issued by a third country to a master, officer or radio operator, for service on ships flying its flag, shall submit a request for recognition of that third country to the Commission, stating its reasons.\nThe Commission, assisted by the European Maritime Safety Agency and with the possible involvement of any Member State concerned, shall collect the information referred to in Annex II and shall carry out an assessment of the training and certification systems in the third country for which the request for recognition was submitted, in order to verify whether the country concerned meets all the requirements of the STCW Convention and whether the appropriate measures have been taken to prevent fraud involving certificates.\n3.   The decision on the recognition of a third country shall be taken by the Commission in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 28(2), within three months from the date of the request for recognition.\nIf granted, the recognition shall be valid subject to the provisions of Article 20.\nIf no decision is taken on recognition of the third country concerned within the period laid down in the first subparagraph, the Member State submitting the request may decide to recognise the third country unilaterally until a decision is taken in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 28(2).\n4.   A Member State may decide, with respect to ships flying its flag, to endorse certificates issued by the third countries recognised by the Commission, account being taken of the provisions contained in Annex II, points (4) and (5).\n5.   Recognitions of certificates issued by recognised third countries and published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series, before 14 June 2005 shall remain valid.\nThese recognitions may be used by all Member States unless the Commission has subsequently withdrawn them pursuant to Article 20.\n6.   The Commission shall draw up and update a list of the third countries that have been recognised. The list shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series.\n7.   Notwithstanding Article 5(6), a Member State may, if circumstances require, allow a seafarer to serve in a capacity other than radio officer or radio operator, except as provided by the Radio Regulations, for a period not exceeding three months on board a ship flying its flag, while holding an appropriate and valid certificate issued and endorsed as required by a third country, but not yet endorsed for recognition by the Member State concerned so as to render it appropriate for service on board a ship flying its flag.\nDocumentary proof shall be kept readily available that application for an endorsement has been submitted to the competent authorities.\nArticle 20\nNon-compliance with the requirements of the STCW Convention\n1.   Notwithstanding the criteria specified in Annex II, when a Member State considers that a recognised third country no longer complies with the requirements of the STCW Convention, it shall notify the Commission immediately, giving substantiated reasons therefor.\nThe Commission shall without delay refer the matter to the Committee referred to in Article 28(1).\n2.   Notwithstanding the criteria set out in Annex II, when the Commission considers that a recognised third country no longer complies with the requirements of the STCW Convention, it shall notify the Member States immediately, giving substantiated reasons therefor.\nThe Commission shall without delay refer the matter to the Committee referred to in Article 28(1).\n3.   When a Member State intends to withdraw the endorsements of all certificates issued by a third country it shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of its intention, giving substantiated reasons therefor.\n4.   The Commission, assisted by the European Maritime Safety Agency, shall reassess the recognition of the third country concerned in order to verify whether that country failed to comply with the requirements of the STCW Convention.\n5.   Where there are indications that a particular maritime training establishment no longer complies with the requirements of the STCW Convention, the Commission shall notify the country concerned that recognition of that country’s certificates will be withdrawn in two months’ time unless measures are taken to ensure compliance with all the requirements of the STCW Convention.\n6.   The decision on the withdrawal of the recognition shall be taken in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 28(2), within two months from the date of the communication made by the Member State.\nThe Member States concerned shall take appropriate measures to implement the decision.\n7.   Endorsements attesting recognition of certificates, issued in accordance with Article 5(6) before the date on which the decision to withdraw recognition of the third country is taken, shall remain valid. Seafarers holding such endorsements may not claim an endorsement recognising a higher qualification, however, unless that upgrading is based solely on additional seagoing service experience.\nArticle 21\nReassessment\n1.   The third countries that have been recognised under the procedure referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 19(3), including those referred to in Article 19(6), shall be reassessed by the Commission, with the assistance of the European Maritime Safety Agency, on a regular basis and at least every five years to verify that they fulfil the relevant criteria set out in Annex II and whether the appropriate measures have been taken to prevent fraud involving certificates.\n2.   The Commission shall define the priority criteria for assessment of third countries on the basis of performance data provided by the port State control pursuant to Article 23, as well as the information relating to the reports of the independent evaluations communicated by third countries pursuant to section A-I/7 of the STCW Code.\n3.   The Commission shall provide the Member States with a report on the results of the assessment.\nArticle 22\nPort State control\n1.   Irrespective of the flag it flies each ship, with the exception of those types of ships excluded by Article 2, shall, while in the ports of a Member State, be subject to port State control by officers duly authorised by that Member State to verify that all seafarers serving on board who are required to be certificated by the STCW Convention are so certificated or hold appropriate dispensations.\n2.   When exercising port State control under this Directive, Member States shall ensure that all relevant provisions and procedures laid down in Directive 95/21/EC are applied.\nArticle 23\nPort State control procedures\n1.   Without prejudice to Directive 95/21/EC, port State control pursuant to Article 22 shall be limited to the following:\n(a)\nverification that every seafarer serving on board who must be certificated in accordance with the STCW Convention holds an appropriate certificate or a valid dispensation or provides documentary proof that an application for an endorsement attesting recognition has been submitted to the authorities of the flag State;\n(b)\nverification that the numbers and certificates of the seafarers serving on board are in accordance with the safe-manning requirements of the authorities of the flag State.\n2.   The ability of the ship’s seafarers to maintain watchkeeping standards as required by the STCW Convention shall be assessed in accordance with Part A of the STCW Code if there are clear grounds for believing that such standards are not being maintained because any of the following has occurred:\n(a)\nthe ship has been involved in a collision, grounding or stranding;\n(b)\nthere has been a discharge of substances from the ship when under way, at anchor or at berth which is illegal under an international convention;\n(c)\nthe ship has been manoeuvred in an erratic or unsafe manner whereby routing measures adopted by the IMO, or safe navigation practices and procedures have not been followed;\n(d)\nthe ship is otherwise being operated in such a manner as to pose a danger to persons, property or the environment;\n(e)\na certificate has been fraudulently obtained or the holder of a certificate is not the person to whom that certificate was originally issued;\n(f)\nthe ship is flying the flag of a country which has not ratified the STCW Convention, or has a master, officer or rating holding a certificate issued by a third country which has not ratified the STCW Convention.\n3.   Notwithstanding verification of the certificate, assessment under paragraph 2 may require the seafarer to demonstrate the relevant competence at the place of duty. Such a demonstration may include verification that operational requirements in respect of watchkeeping standards have been met and that there is a proper response to emergency situations within the seafarer’s level of competence.\nArticle 24\nDetention\nWithout prejudice to Directive 95/21/EC, the following deficiencies, in so far as they have been determined by the officer carrying out the port State control that they pose a danger to persons, property or the environment, shall be the only grounds under this Directive on which a Member State may detain a ship:\n(a)\nfailure of seafarers to hold certificates, to have appropriate certificates, to have valid dispensations or provide documentary proof that an application for an endorsement attesting recognition has been submitted to the authorities of the flag State;\n(b)\nfailure to comply with the applicable safe-manning requirements of the flag State;\n(c)\nfailure of navigational or engineering-watch arrangements to conform to the requirements specified for the ship by the flag State;\n(d)\nabsence in a watch of a person qualified to operate equipment essential to safe navigation, safety radio communications or the prevention of marine pollution;\n(e)\nfailure to provide proof of professional proficiency for the duties assigned to seafarers for the safety of the ship and the prevention of pollution;\n(f)\ninability to provide for the first watch at the commencement of a voyage and for subsequent relieving watches persons who are sufficiently rested and otherwise fit for duty.\nArticle 25\nRegular monitoring of compliance\nWithout prejudice to the powers of the Commission under Article 226 of the Treaty, the Commission, assisted by the European Maritime Safety Agency, shall verify on a regular basis and at least every five years that Member States comply with the minimum requirements laid down by this Directive.\nArticle 26\nReports\n1.   Not later than 14 December 2008 the Commission shall submit an evaluation report to the European Parliament and the Council, based on a detailed analysis and evaluation of the provisions of the STCW Convention, the implementation thereof and new insights gained with regard to the correlation between safety and the level of training of ships’ crews.\n2.   Not later than 20 October 2010 the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council an evaluation report drawn up on the basis of the information obtained pursuant to Article 25.\nIn the report the Commission shall analyse the Member States’ compliance with this Directive and, where necessary, make proposals for additional measures.\nArticle 27\nAmendment\n1.

the minimum level of training of seafarers\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt incorporates, into EU law, minimum standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers serving on board EU vessels which are fixed by the convention on standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers (STCW convention) of the International Maritime Organisation. The convention was adopted in 1978.\nDirective 2012/35/EU introduced a number of amendments to Directive 2008/106/EC.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThis directive applies to seafarers serving on board seagoing ships flying the flag of an EU country, with the exception of:\nwarships or other ships owned by an EU country and engaged only in governmental, non-commercial services;\nfishing vessels;\npleasure yachts not engaged in trade;\nwooden ships of primitive build.\nTraining\nThe directive sets out the rules on training and the standards of competence to be met by seafarers who are candidates for the issue or revalidation of certificates that allow them to perform the functions for which the relevant certificate of competency or proficiency is issued.\nThe categories of seafarer to which these rules relate are:\nmasters;\nchief mates;\ndeck officers and engineer officers;\nchief engineer officers and second engineer officers;\ncertain categories of ratings (i.e. those working in an engine room, those who form part of a watch or those serving on certain types of ship); and\npersonnel responsible for radiocommunication.\nFor certain categories of vessel, such as tankers and ro-ro passenger ships, there are special rules and mandatory minimum requirements concerning their training and qualifications of seafarers. The directive also lays down rules on education and training in the management of emergency situations, fire-fighting and the supply of medical aid, as well as for crew members responsible for catering services.\nCertificates of competency, certificates of proficiency and endorsements\nCertificates must be issued by the competent authorities of EU countries to permit holders to serve as stated in the document or as authorised by national regulations. These documents are issued to candidates who meet the national standards for physical fitness (particularly regarding eyesight and hearing) and who provide satisfactory proof of identity, age, service at sea and skills (ability, task and level).\nEU countries may issue separate certificates for radio operators.\nHolders of certificates are required to prove, at regular intervals, that they still meet the standards for skills and professional competence.\nEndorsements may be included in certificates or may be issued separately. Certificates may use the format contained in the STCW code (Section A-I/2) or may depart from it (in which case they must, as a minimum, include the information required in the format). Any seafarer on board must be able to produce the original copy of their certificate. EU countries must also apply the necessary measures to prevent and penalise fraud and other illegal practices concerning the certification procedure.\nAmending Directive 2012/35/EU introduced a requirement for EU countries to:\nmaintain registers of all certificates of competency and certificates of proficiency and endorsements for masters and officers and, where applicable, ratings which are issued, have expired or have been revalidated, suspended, cancelled or reported as lost or destroyed, as well as of dispensations issued;\nmake available information on the status of certificates of competency, endorsements and dispensations to other EU countries or other parties to the STCW convention, as well as companies which request verification of the authenticity and validity of certificates — as of 1 January 2017, the information required must be made available by electronic means;\ndraw up standards of medical fitness for seafarers and procedures for the issue of a medical certificate in accordance with the directive and with Section A-I/9 of the STCW code — those responsible for assessing the medical fitness of seafarers must be medical practitioners recognised by that EU country for the purpose of such medical examinations.\nPenalties and disciplinary measures\nEU countries must establish the necessary processes and procedures to carry out an impartial investigation in cases of incompetence, acts or omissions that may pose a direct threat to the safety of human life, the safety of goods at sea or the marine environment. Penalties or disciplinary measures are to be provided for and applied where:\na company or master has engaged a person not holding a certificate as required by this directive;\na master has authorised a seafarer to carry out a function for which a certificate is required but they are not the holder of such a certificate, a certificate recognised by the EU countries or a valid dispensation;\na person has fraudulently obtained an engagement to perform a function or to serve in a capacity for which a certificate is required.\nMonitoring and evaluation of training\nEU countries must ensure that:\nthere is continuous monitoring of all training, assessment of issuing competency certificates and the definition of a system of quality standards detailing objectives and scope;\ntraining and teaching objectives as well as the equivalence of training levels with the requirements of the STCW convention are defined;\nthe quality of examinations, assessments and the quality and experience of assessors is monitored;\nindependent evaluations of knowledge, understanding, skills and competence acquisition and assessment activities are carried out at intervals of no more than 5 years.\nRest periods for watchkeeping personnel\nIn order to prevent fatigue amongst watchkeeping personnel, which is very often the cause of accidents at sea, there are rules concerning minimum rest periods.\nAll who are assigned duty as officer in charge of a watch, or as a rating that forms part of a watch, must be allowed at least 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period. This may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which must be at least 6 hours long. In addition, amending Directive 2012/35/EU requires that such officers or ratings have 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period.\nDispensations\nIn circumstances of exceptional necessity, competent authorities may issue a dispensation permitting a given seafarer to serve on a given vessel for a specified period not exceeding 6 months. This would be in a capacity for which the seafarer does not hold the appropriate certificate as long as their qualifications are sufficient to guarantee normal safety conditions.\nEU country responsibilities\nEU countries must designate the authorities or bodies that are to:\ngive training;\norganise and/or supervise the required examinations;\nissue certificates;\ngrant possible dispensations.\nOn-board communication\nTo enhance maritime safety and prevent loss of human life and maritime pollution, communication among crew members on board ships sailing in EU waters must be improved.\nA common working language must be established on board all passenger ships flying the flag of an EU country and on board all passenger ships starting and/or finishing a voyage in an EU country’s port. In the case of oil, chemical or liquefied gas tankers, the directive requires that the master, officers and ratings be able to communicate with each other in one or several common working languages.\nPort state control\nEU countries can monitor seafarers serving on any ship using their ports, irrespective of the flag it flies, in particular to verify that all seafarers who are required to be certified by the STCW convention are. They must ensure that the relevant rules and procedures laid down in Directive 2009/16/EC on port state control are applied.\nIn some cases, it is necessary to assess the ability of seafarers to maintain watchkeeping standards as required by the convention (verification of certificates). This is especially necessary where a ship using an EU port flying the flag of a country which has not ratified the STCW convention has been used in such a way as to present a danger for persons, goods or the environment, or has a master, officer or rating holding a certificate issued by a non-EU country which has not ratified the convention. In other cases, crew members may be asked to provide an on-the-spot demonstration of their competence.\nThe directive specifies the grounds on which a vessel may be detained, such as lack of training or working conditions of the crew, where it has been established that these inadequacies represent a danger for goods, persons or the environment.\nIn 2015, the European Commission published a list of non-EU countries recognised as far as the systems for training and certification of seafarers. Since then, Ethiopia, Fiji, Oman and Montenegro have been added to this list.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2008/106/EC has applied since 23 December 2008.
