Fishing opportunities should be allocated among Member States in such a way as to assure each Member State relative stability of fishing activities for each stock or fishery and having due regard to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) established by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\n(4)\nThe total allowable catches (‘TACs’) should be established on the basis of available scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), taking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, and in particular the advisory councils concerned.\n(5)\nFor stocks for which there is no sufficient or reliable data in order to provide size estimates, management measures and TAC levels should follow the precautionary approach to fisheries management as defined in point (8) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, while taking into account stock-specific factors, including, in particular, available information on stock trends and mixed fisheries considerations.\n(6)\nPursuant to Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, for stocks subject to specific multiannual plans the TACs should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in those plans. The Western Waters multiannual plan was established by Regulation (EU) 2019/472 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) and entered into force in 2019. Since the ranges of FMSY cannot be determined for any of the stocks which are covered by this Regulation and which fall within the scope of the Western Waters multiannual plan, fishing opportunities for those stocks should be fixed in accordance with the objectives of that plan and taking into account the best available scientific advice as well as the precautionary approach to fisheries management when no adequate scientific information is available, while also taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) at the same time, especially in situations where that leads to a premature closure of the fishery.\n(7)\nWhere a TAC relating to a stock is allocated to one Member State only, it is appropriate to empower that Member State, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty, to determine the level of such TAC. Provisions should be made to ensure that, when fixing that TAC level, the Member State concerned act in a manner fully consistent with the principles and rules of the CFP.\n(8)\nFor certain TACs, shared quotas are available for Member States without an allocated quota, indicated as ‘Others’. Member States having used such shared quota may later obtain a quota of their own, e.g. through an exchange. When reporting catches to the Commission in respect of the same TAC, Member States should make the distinction between the catches to be counted against their own quota and the catches to be counted against the shared quota. To allow such distinction, a separate reporting code should be introduced.\n(9)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (3) introduced additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs, including flexibility provisions for precautionary and analytical TACs. Under that Regulation, when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Article 3 or 4 of that Regulation is not to apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. In 2014, a further year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the CFP and deteriorate the biological status of the stocks, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.\n(10)\nIn accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the landing obligation applies fully from 1 January 2019 and all species subject to catch limits are to be landed. Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, when the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock applies, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches. On the basis of the joint recommendations submitted by Member States and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2019/472, the Commission adopted a number of delegated Regulations laying down details for the implementation of the landing obligation in the form of specific discard plans.\n(11)\nWhen fixing fishing opportunities for stocks of species falling under the landing obligation, account should be taken of the fact that discarding is in principle no longer allowed. Therefore, the fishing opportunities should be based on the advice figure for total catches (instead of the advice figure for wanted catches), as provided by ICES. The amounts that, by way of exception from the landing obligation, may continue to be discarded should be deducted from that advice figure for total catches.\n(12)\nFixing fishing opportunities should be in accordance with international agreements and principles, such as the 1995 United Nations agreement relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks (4), and with the detailed management principles laid down in the International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas adopted in 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, according to which, in particular, a regulator should be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information should not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.\n(13)\nCatches of red seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) are made in the areas of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF) and General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), which border on ICES subarea 9. Given that ICES data for those adjacent areas are incomplete, the scope of the TAC should remain limited to ICES subarea 9.\n(14)\nSince no agreement has been reached yet with the United Kingdom on TAC levels for straddling fish stocks and in order to establish an appropriate regulatory framework for Union fishing activities until decisions on joint management are taken, provisional fishing opportunities should be fixed for the first three months of 2021. Such provisional fishing opportunities should be fixed at levels that do not prejudge the outcome of the consultations with the relevant third countries and should not jeopardise the possibility of setting permanent TACs in line with scientific advice. Therefore, as a general approach, they should correspond to 25 % of the Union share of the fishing opportunities fixed for 2020. Those provisional fishing opportunities should in no circumstances stand in the way of setting definitive fishing opportunities in accordance with international agreements, in particular the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part (5), and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part, which applies provisionally from 1 January 2021, and the outcome of consultations, the Union legal framework and the scientific advice.\n(15)\nICES advised not to have catches of orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) until 2024. It is appropriate for the fishing, retaining on board, transhipping and landing of that species to remain prohibited, as the stock is depleted and is not recovering. ICES noted that there have been no directed Union fisheries for that species in the North-East Atlantic since 2010.\n(16)\nICES advised to minimise the fishing mortality of deep-sea sharks. The deep-sea sharks are long-lived species with low reproductive rates and have become overexploited. Therefore, fishing for those species should be prohibited.\n(17)\nIn order to avoid the interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the fishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2021. In order to allow Member States to ensure a timely application of this Regulation, it should enter into force immediately after its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation fixes, for the years 2021 and 2022, annual fishing opportunities available to Union fishing vessels for fish stocks of certain deep-sea species in Union waters and in certain non-Union waters where catch limits are required.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 apply.

Multiannual management plans have been adopted for EU fishery regions (for example, the Western Waters multiannual plan — see summary).\nTACs are based on the best available scientific advice, including reports by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, and take into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors. However, deep-sea stocks tend to be widely distributed in depths that are difficult to examine for practical reasons. Data from scientific surveys are therefore often not available, due to the reduced commercial importance of these stocks, or do not cover the whole distribution area. For these reasons, management measures and TAC levels need to follow the precautionary approach to fisheries management*.\nThe majority of deep-sea stocks are shared with the United Kingdom, and TACs are agreed in annual consultations between the EU and the United Kingdom. In cases where fish stocks are only found in EU waters, TACs are decided by the EU Member States, based on a proposal from the European Commission.\nThe TAC for each individual species is divided into quotas, i.e. proportions of the TAC assigned to the EU, Member States or non-EU countries.\nAllocations of TACs\nThe TACs for deep-sea species caught by EU-registered fishing vessels in EU waters and in certain non-EU waters — along with the allocation of those TACs among Member States and any related conditions, where appropriate — are set out in the annexes to Regulation (EU) 2021/91 and amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1239.\nEU fishing vessels may be authorised to fish, within the TACs set out in the annex, in waters falling within the fisheries jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, subject to the conditions set out in Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets and its implementing rules (see summary).\nLanding obligation\nSince 1 January 2019, all EU fishing fleets have been required to adhere to the landing obligation, which has ended the practice of discarding. Catches that are not subject to the landing obligation in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the common fisheries policy (see summary) must be retained on board or landed only if they:\nhave been taken by vessels flying the flag of a Member State having a quota, and that quota has not been exhausted; or\nconsist of a share in an EU quota which has not been allocated by quota among Member States, and that EU quota has not been exhausted.\nConservation of deep-sea sharks and orange roughy\nThe regulation prohibits the fishing of deep-sea sharks and orange roughy, as they are both vulnerable species.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAgrifish Council adopts 2021 fishing opportunities for the North-East Atlantic and for deep-sea stocks — press release (European Commission)\nSustainable fisheries (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nDeep-sea species. Deep-sea species are caught in depths of up to 1,500 metres, beyond the main fishing grounds of the continental shelves. Deep-sea fish stocks are highly vulnerable to fishing and slow to recover because they reproduce at slow rates. Deep-sea species include fish such as alfonsinos, black scabbardfish, roundnose grenadier, red seabream and some shark species.\nMaximum sustainable yield (MSY). The largest yield (catch) that can be taken from the stock of a species over an indefinite period, i.e. without endangering its survival.\nPrecautionary approach to fisheries management. An approach where the absence of adequate scientific information should not justify postponing or failing to take management measures to conserve target species, associated or dependent species and non-target species and their environment.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2021/91 of 28 January 2021 fixing, for the years 2021 and 2022, the fishing opportunities for Union fishing vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks (OJ L 31, 29.1.2021, pp. 20–30).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/91 have been incorporated into the original text.
