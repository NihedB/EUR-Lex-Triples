{"celex_id": "32014R0964", "reference": "12.9.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 271/16\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 964/2014\nof 11 September 2014\nlaying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards standard terms and conditions for financial instruments\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 38(3) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nTo facilitate the use of financial instruments set up at national, regional, transnational or cross-border level and managed by or under the responsibility of the managing authority in accordance with Article 38(3)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, rules on standard terms and conditions for certain financial instruments should be established. Those standard terms and conditions would make those instruments ready to use — the so-called off-the-shelf financial instruments.\n(2)\nTo facilitate the use of financial instruments, the standard terms and conditions need to ensure compliance with state aid rules and facilitate the delivery of Union financial support of final recipients through a combination of financial instruments and grants.\n(3)\nThe standard terms and conditions should not allow a finance provider, such as a public or private investor or a lender, a manager of the financial instrument, or a final recipient to receive any state aid which is incompatible with the internal market. The standard terms and conditions should take into account the relevant de minimis Regulations such as Commission Regulation (EU) No 1407/2013 (2) and Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 (3), Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (4), Commission Regulation (EU) No 702/2014 (5), the Guidelines on State aid to promote risk finance investments (6) and the Guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas 2014 to 2020 (7).\n(4)\nGiven that the State aid rules do not apply to agricultural activities supported under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, compliance with the standard terms and conditions should be voluntary. For other activities receiving support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, general State aid rules apply and therefore, the standard terms and conditions should be mandatory.\n(5)\nIt is possible that undertakings in the fisheries sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), may benefit from financial instruments financed by a European Structural and Investment Fund. When such a benefit is funded by another European Structural and Investment Fund than the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the total amount of the aid granted through the financial instruments to all undertakings in the fisheries and aquaculture sector over three years should be below a cap of the annual fishery, aquaculture and processing turnover by Member State specified in Commission Regulation (EU) No 717/2014 (8). In addition Regulation (EU) No 702/2014 and the Guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture (9) should to be taken into account.\n(6)\nThe standard terms and conditions should also include a minimum set of governance requirements to ensure proper management of the financial instruments in order to provide for more detailed rules than those included in the Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n(7)\nIn order to support SMEs growth in a difficult funding environment, a portfolio risk sharing loan (‘RS loan’) is an appropriate financial instrument. The RS loan provides new loans to SMEs with easier access to finance by providing financial intermediaries with funding contribution and credit risk sharing and thereby offering SMEs with more funds at preferential conditions in terms of interest rate reduction and/or collateral reduction.\n(8)\nFinancing through the RS loan may be a particularly effective way of supporting SMEs in a context of limited availability of funding or relatively little risk appetite of the financial intermediaries for certain sectors or type of SMEs. In this context, the standard terms and conditions are an effective way to address such market failure.\n(9)\nIn order to provide an incentive to financial intermediaries to increase lending to SMEs covered by Union funded guarantees, a capped portfolio guarantee is an appropriate financial instrument.\n(10)\nThe capped portfolio guarantee should address the existing gap in the debt market for SMEs supporting new loans by providing credit risk protection (in the form of a first loss portfolio capped guarantee) with the aim to reduce the particular difficulties that SMEs face in accessing finance because of the lack of sufficient collateral in combination with the relatively high credit risk they represent. In order to achieve the expected impact, the Union contribution to the capped portfolio guarantee should, however, not replace equivalent guarantees received by the respective financial institutions for the same purpose under existing Union, national and regional financial instruments. In this context, the standard terms and conditions are an effective way to address such market failure.\n(11)\nIn order to incentivize the energy saving potential arising from the renovation of residential buildings, a renovation loan is an appropriate financial instrument.\n(12)\nThe renovation loan should target long term subsidised loan conditions and upfront technical support and funding of residential building owners to prepare and implement building renovation projects. It also assumes a financing market in which banking intermediaries are essentially the only source of funding, but where this funding is either too little (due to the risk appetite of the intermediary), too short term, too costly or otherwise inappropriate for the long term payback nature of the projects being financed. This, together with an inefficient system of identifying and procuring the works on behalf of multiple apartment owners without excluding the possibility to support individuals, constitutes a market failure. In this context, the standard terms and conditions are an effective way to address such market failure.\n(13)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Coordination Committee for the European Structural and Investment Funds,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules concerning the standard terms and conditions for the following financial instruments:\n(a)\na portfolio risk sharing loan (RS Loan);\n(b)\na capped portfolio guarantee;\n(c)\na renovation loan.\nArticle 2\nAdditional terms and conditions\nManaging authorities may include other terms and conditions in addition to those to be included in the funding agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions for the selected financial instrument set out in this Regulation.\nArticle 3\nCompliance with State aid rules under the standard terms and conditions\n1.   In case of financial instruments combined with grants for technical support to final recipients benefiting from one of the instruments, such grants shall not exceed 5 % of the ESI Funds contribution to the instrument and be subject to the conclusions of the ex-ante assessment justifying such grants referred to in Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n2.   The body implementing the financial instrument (hereinafter ‘the financial intermediary’) shall manage the grant for technical support. The technical support shall not cover the activities which are covered by management cost and fees received to manage the financial instrument. The expenditure covered by the technical support may not constitute part of the investment to be financed by the loan under the relevant financial instrument.\nArticle 4\nGovernance under the standard terms and conditions\n1.   The managing authority or, if applicable, the fund of funds manager shall be represented in the supervisory committee or a similar type of governance structure of the financial instrument.\n2.   The managing authority shall not participate directly in individual investment decisions. In the case of a fund of funds, the managing authority shall exercise only its supervisory role at the level of the fund of funds without interfering in individual decisions by the fund of funds.\n3.   The financial instrument shall have a governance structure that allows for decisions concerning credit and risk diversification to be made transparently in line with relevant market practice.\n4.   The fund of funds manager and the financial intermediary shall have a governance structure that ensures impartiality and independence of the fund of funds manager or of the financial intermediary.\nArticle 5\nFunding agreement under the standard terms and conditions\n1.

The RS Loan shall take the form of a loan fund to be set up by a financial intermediary with contribution from the programme and contribution of at least 25 % of the loan fund from the financial intermediary. The loan fund shall finance a portfolio of newly originated loans, to the exclusion of the refinancing of existing loans.\n2.   The RS Loan shall comply with the terms and conditions set out in Annex II.\nArticle 7\nCapped Portfolio Guarantee\n1.   The Capped Portfolio Guarantee shall provide credit risk coverage on a loan by loan basis up to a guarantee rate of maximum 80 %, for the creation of a portfolio of new loans to the small and medium-sized enterprises up to a maximum loss amount fixed by the guarantee cap rate which shall not exceed 25 % of the risk exposure at portfolio level.\n2.   The Capped Portfolio Guarantee shall comply with the terms and conditions set out in Annex III.\nArticle 8\nRenovation Loan\n1.   The Renovation Loan shall take the form of a loan fund to be set up by a financial intermediary with contribution from the programme and contribution of at least 15 % of the loan fund from the financial intermediary. The loan fund shall finance a portfolio of newly originated loans, to the exclusion of the refinancing of existing loans.\n2.   Final recipients may be natural or legal persons or independent professionals, owning premises as well as administrators or other legal bodies acting on behalf and for the benefit of owners, implementing energy efficiency or renewable energies measures that are eligible under Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and programme support.\n3.

The fund of funds shall in this case take the pro-rata part of the risk sharing between the different contributions in the portfolio of loans. State aid rules have to be respected if the resources provided by the fund of funds are State resources.\nState aid implication\nThe RS Loan shall be designed as a State aid free instrument, i.e. market-conform remuneration for the financial intermediary, full pass-on of financial advantage by the financial intermediary to the final recipients, and the financing provided to the final recipients are under the applicable de minimis Regulation.\n(a)   Aid at the level of the financial intermediary and the fund of funds is excluded when:\n1.\nthe financial intermediary and the managing authority or fund of funds bear at any time the losses and benefits in proportion to their contributions (pro-rata) and there is an economically significant participation of the financial intermediary in the Risk Sharing loan, and\n2.\nThe remuneration (i.e. management costs and/or fees) of the financial intermediary and the fund of funds reflects the current market remuneration in comparable situations, which is the case when the latter has been selected through an open, transparent, non-discriminatory and objective selection procedure or if the remuneration is aligned with the Articles 12 and 13 of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014 and no other advantages are granted by the State. Where the fund of fund only transfers the ESIF contribution to the financial intermediary, and has a public interest mission, and has no commercial activity when implementing the measure, and is not co-investing with its own resources — therefore it is not considered a beneficiary of aid, — it is enough that the fund of fund is not overcompensated, and\n3.\nThe financial advantage of the programme public contribution to the instrument shall be fully passed on to the final recipients in the form of an interest rate reduction. When selecting the financial intermediary, the managing authority shall, in line with the Article 7(2) of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014, asses the pricing policy and the methodology to pass on the financial advantage to the final recipients.\nWhere the financial intermediary does not pass on all the financial advantage to the final recipients, the undisbursed public contribution shall be transferred back to the managing authority.\n(b)   At the level of the SMEs:\nAt the SMEs' level, the loan shall comply with the de minimis rules.\nFor each loan inserted in the portfolio, the financial intermediary shall calculate the GGE by using the following calculation methodology:\nCalculation of the GGE = Nominal amount of the loan (EUR) × (Cost of funding (standard practice) + Cost of risk (standard practice) – Any fees charged by the managing authority on the programme contribution to the financial intermediary) × Weighted average life of the loan (Years) × Risk sharing rate.\nWhen the GGE is calculated with the above mentioned formula, for the purpose of the Risk Sharing loan, the requirement as foreseen in Article 4 of the de minimis Regulation (1) is considered to be met. There is no minimum collateral requirement.\nA verification mechanism shall ensure that the GGE calculated with the above mentioned formula is not below than the GGE calculated following the Article 4(3)(c) of the de minimis Regulation.\nThe total amount of aid calculated with the GGE cannot be above EUR 200 000 over a 3 years fiscal period taking into account the cumulation rule for final recipients in the de minimis Regulation.\nTechnical support grant or another grant provided to the final recipient shall be cumulated with the calculated GGE.\nRegarding SMEs in the fisheries and aquaculture sector, the aid shall comply with the relevant rules of the fisheries de minimis Regulation.\nFor activities supported by the EAFRD, general rules apply.\nLending policy\n(a)   Disbursement from the managing authority or fund of funds to the financial intermediary:\nFollowing the signature of a funding agreement between the managing authority and the fund of funds or the financial intermediary, the relevant managing authority transfers public contributions from the programme to the fund of funds or the financial intermediary which places such contributions in a dedicated Risk Sharing loan fund. The transfer shall be in tranches and respect the ceilings of the Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nThe target lending volume and range of interest rate shall be confirmed within the ex-ante assessment in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013and shall be taken into account to determine the nature of the instrument (revolving or non-revolving instrument).\n(b)   Origination of a portfolio of new loans:\nThe financial intermediary shall be required to originate within a pre-determined limited period of time a portfolio of new eligible loans in addition to its current loan activities, partly funded from the disbursed funds under the programme at the risk-sharing rate agreed in the funding agreement.\nEligible loans for SMEs (according to pre-defined eligibility criteria on a loan-by-loan and portfolio level) shall be automatically included in the Portfolio, by way of submitting inclusion notices at least on a quarterly basis.\nThe financial intermediary shall implement a consistent lending policy, especially regarding portfolio diversification, enabling a sound credit portfolio management and risk diversification, while complying with the applicable industry standards and while remaining aligned with the managing authority's financial interests and policy objectives.\nThe identification, selection, due diligence, documentation and execution of the loans to final recipients shall be performed by the financial intermediary in accordance with its standard procedures and in accordance with the principles set out in the relevant funding agreement.\n(c)   Re-use of resources paid back to financial instrument:\nResources paid back to the financial instrument shall be either reused within the same financial instrument (revolving within the same financial instrument) or after being paid back to the managing authority or the fund of funds they shall be used in accordance with Article 44 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nWhen revolving within the same financial instrument, as a matter of principle, the amounts that are attributable to the support of the ESIF and that are reimbursed and/or recovered by the financial intermediary from loans to final recipients within the time framework for investments shall be made available for new use within the same financial instrument. This revolving approach as referred at Articles 44 and 45 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be included in the funding agreement.\nAlternatively, if the managing authority or the fund of funds is directly repaid, the repayments shall occur regularly mirroring (i) principal repayments (on a pro rata basis on the basis of the risk sharing rate) (ii) any recovered amounts and losses deductions (according to the risk sharing rate), of the SME loans and (iii) any interest rate payments.

State aid rules have to be respected also in relation to such resources if they are public resources.\nState aid implication\nThe Renovation Loan shall be designed as a State aid free instrument, i.e. market-conform remuneration for the financial intermediary, full pass-on of financial advantage by the financial intermediary to the final recipients, and the financing provided to the final recipients are under the applicable de minimis Regulation.\n(a)   Aid at the level of the financial intermediary and the fund of funds is excluded when:\n(1)\nthe financial intermediary and the managing authority or fund of funds bear at any time the losses and benefits in proportion to their contribution (pro-rata) and there is an economically significant participation of the financial intermediary in the Renovation loan instrument, and\n(2)\nThe remuneration (i.e. management costs and/or fees) of the financial intermediary and the fund of funds reflects the current market remuneration in comparable situations, which is the case when the they have been selected through an open, transparent, non-discriminatory and objective selection procedure or if their remuneration is aligned with the Articles 12 and 13 of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014 and no other advantages are granted by the State. Where the fund of fund only transfers the ESIF contribution to the financial intermediary, and has a public interest mission, and has no commercial activity when implementing the measure, and is not co-investing with its own resources — therefore it is not considered a beneficiary of aid, — it is enough that the fund of fund is not overcompensated, and\n(3)\nThe financial advantage of the programme public contribution to the instrument shall be fully passed on to the final recipients in the form of an interest rate reduction. When selecting the financial intermediary, the managing authority shall, in line with the Article 7(2) of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014, asses the pricing policy and the methodology to pass on the financial advantage to the final recipients.\nWhere the financial intermediary does not pass on all the financial advantage to the final recipients, the undisbursed public contribution shall be transferred back to the managing authority.\n(b)   Aid at the level of an entity acting on behalf of the owners (i.e. natural and legal persons, independent professionals owning premises, administrators, other legal bodies):\nAid at the level of an entity acting on behalf of the owners is excluded when:\n(1)\nthe entity does not benefit from any direct transfers of public support and\n(2)\nThe entity transfers all the financial advantages of the programme public contribution to the final recipients\n(c)   At the level of the owners without or with an economic activity (legal person or independent professionals, landlords and owners who install renewable energies, supplying part of the energy produced to the grid):\nOwners that are natural persons and which are not considered undertakings because they do not exercise an economic activity are not considered to be beneficiaries of State aid.\nOwners with an economic activity qualify as an ‘undertaking’ and are subject to State aid rules. In particular, this is the case if they are landlords (renting is an economic activity) and in the case of installing renewable energies, if part of the renewable energies produced is supplied to the grid (supplying energy to the grid is considered an economic activity).\nAt the level of the owners with an economic activity, the aid shall comply with the de minimis rules.\nFor each loan inserted within the portfolio regarding owners with an economic activity, the financial intermediary shall calculate the GGE by using the following calculation methodology:\nCalculation of the GGE = Nominal amount of the loan (EUR) × (Cost of funding (standard practice) + Cost of risk (standard practice) – Any fees charged by the managing authority on the programme contribution to the financial intermediary) × Weighted average life of the loan (Years) × Risk sharing rate.\nWhen the GGE is calculated with the above mentioned formula, for the purpose of the Renovation loan instrument, the requirement as foreseen in Article 4 of the de minimis Regulation (1) is considered to be met. There is no minimum collateral requirement.\nA verification mechanism shall ensure that the GGE calculated with the above mentioned formula is not below than the GGE calculated following the Article 4(3)(c) of the de minimis Regulation.\nThe total amount of aid calculated with the GGE cannot be above EUR 200 000 over a 3 years fiscal period taking into account the cumulation rule for final recipients in the de minimis Regulation.\nTechnical support grant or another grant provided to the final recipient shall be cumulated with the calculated GGE.\nLending policy\n(a)   Disbursement from the managing authority or fund of funds to the financial intermediary:\nFollowing the signature of a funding agreement between the managing authority and the fund of funds or the financial intermediary, the relevant managing authority transfers public contributions from the programme to the fund of funds or the financial intermediary which places such contributions in a dedicated Renovation loan fund. The transfer shall be in tranches and respect the ceilings of Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nThe target lending volume and range of interest rate shall be confirmed within the ex-ante assessment in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and shall be taken into account to determine the nature of the instrument (revolving or non-revolving instrument).\nThe maximum risk-sharing of the financial instrument towards the final recipients shall be 85 % (i.e. at least 15 % shall be provided by the financial intermediary own funds).\n(b)   Origination of a portfolio of new loans:\nThe financial intermediary shall be required to originate within a pre-determined limited period of time a portfolio of new loans funded according to a risk-sharing rate agreed in the funding agreement (i.e. funded by (i) the programme contribution) (ii) the financial intermediary own fund).\nEligible loans pre-defined according to eligibility criteria on a loan-by-loan basis and portfolio level shall be automatically included in the portfolio by way of submitting inclusion notices at least on a quarterly basis.\nThe financial intermediary shall implement a consistent lending policy, especially regarding portfolio composition enabling a sound credit portfolio management and risk diversification, while aiming at reducing the market failure identified in the ex-ante assessment (referring to Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013) and while remaining aligned with the managing authority's financial interests and policy objectives.\nThe identification, selection, due diligence, documentation and execution of the loans to final recipients shall be performed by the financial intermediary in accordance with its standard procedures and in accordance with the principles set out in the relevant funding agreement.\n(c)   Re-use of resources paid back to financial instrument:\nResources paid back to the financial instrument shall be either reused within the same financial instrument (revolving within the same financial instrument) or after being paid back to the managing authority or the fund of funds they shall be used in accordance with Article 44 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nWhen revolving within the same financial instrument, as a matter of principles, the amounts that are attributable to the support of the ESIF and that are reimbursed and/or recovered by the financial intermediary from loans to final recipients within the time framework for investments shall be made available for new use within the same financial instrument. This revolving approach as referred at Articles 44 and 45 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be included in the funding agreement.\nAlternatively, if managing authority or fund of funds is directly repaid, the repayments shall occur regularly mirroring (i) principal repayments (on a pro rata basis on the basis of the risk sharing rate) (ii) any recovered amounts and losses deductions (according to the risk sharing rate), of the Renovation loans and (iii) any interest rate payments. These resources have to be used in accordance with Articles 44 and 45 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n(d)   Loss recoveries:\nThe financial intermediary shall take recovery actions in relation to each defaulted loan co-financed by the Renovation loan in accordance with its internal guidelines and procedures.\nAmounts recovered by the financial intermediary (net of recovery and foreclosure costs, if any) shall be allocated pro-rata to the risk-sharing between the financial intermediary and the managing authority or the fund of funds.\n(e)   Others:\nInterest and other gains generated by support from the ESI Funds to financial instrument shall be used in accordance with Article 43 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nPricing policy\nWhen proposing its pricing, the financial intermediary shall present a pricing policy and the methodology to ensure the full pass on of the financial advantage of the programme public contribution to the final recipients. The pricing policy and the methodology shall include the following elements:\n(1)\nthe interest rate on the financial intermediary participation is set at market basis (i.e. according to the financial intermediary own policy),\n(2)\nthe overall interest rate, to be charged on loans to the final recipients included in the portfolio, must be reduced proportionally to the allocation provided by the public contribution of the programme. This reduction shall take into account the fees that the managing authority might charge on the programme contribution.\n(3)\nThe GGE calculation as presented in the State aid section shall be applied on each loan included in the Portfolio.\n(4)\nThe pricing policy and the methodology shall remain constant during the eligibility period.\nProgramme contribution to financial instrument: amount and rate (product details)\nThe Renovation loan allocation to financial intermediaries and the minimum risk sharing rate shall be based on the ex-ante assessment findings justifying the support to the financial instrument (Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013) and taking into account the revolving approach of the instrument (if applicable).\nProgramme contribution to financial instrument (activities)\nThe loan portfolio funded by the Renovation loan instrument shall include newly originated loans to the final recipients, to the exclusion of the refinancing of existing loans. The eligibility criteria for inclusion in the portfolio are determined pursuant to the Union law (e.g. Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and Fund-specific rules), programme, national eligibility rules, and with the financial intermediary with the aim of reaching a large number of final recipients and achieving sufficient portfolio diversification and homogeneity in order to allow a reasonable estimation of the portfolio risk profile. These criteria shall reflect market conditions and practices in the relevant country or region.\nThe financial intermediary shall be required to cooperate with regional or national bodies responsible for providing additional services in relation to the implementation of the renovation projects, which includes inter alia: consultancy services; verification and evaluation of project preparation, construction, technical supervision and procurement documents; evaluation of the compliance of renovation projects with Union and national law; the provision of grant support, State aid verification and registration.\nManaging authority's liability\nThe managing authority's liability in relation to the financial instrument shall be as set out in Article 6 of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014.\nDuration\nThe lending period of the financial instrument shall be set in order to ensure that the programme contribution as referred in Article 42 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 is used for loans disbursed to final recipients no later than by 31 December 2023.\nLending and risk-sharing at financial intermediary level (alignment of interest)\nAlignment of interest between the managing authority and the financial intermediary shall be achieved through:\n—\nPerformance fees as provided by Articles 12 and 13 of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014.\n—\nThe financial intermediary must contribute under local market conditions to the financing with at least 15 % of the total financing commitment for lending to final recipients (allowing determining the risk sharing rate).\n—\nThe losses and recoveries shall impact pro-rata the financial intermediary and the managing authority within their respective liability.\nEligible financial intermediaries\nPublic and private bodies established in a Member State which shall be legally authorised to provide Renovation loans to persons owning premises and enterprises operating and owning premises in the jurisdiction of the programme which contributes to the financial instrument.
