{"celex_id": "32006L0126", "reference": "30.12.2006\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 403/18\nDIRECTIVE 2006/126/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 December 2006\non driving licences (Recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 91/439/EEC of 29 July 1991 on driving licences (3) has been significantly amended on several occasions. Now that new amendments are being made to the said Directive, it is desirable, in order to clarify matters, that the provisions in question should be recast.\n(2)\nThe rules on driving licences are essential elements of the common transport policy, contribute to improving road safety, and facilitate the free movement of persons taking up residence in a Member State other than the one issuing the licence. Given the importance of individual means of transport, possession of a driving licence duly recognised by a host Member State promotes free movement and freedom of establishment of persons. Despite the progress achieved with harmonising the rules on driving licences, significant differences have persisted between Member States in the rules on periodicity of licences renewal and on subcategories of vehicles, which needed to be harmonised more fully, in order to contribute to the implementation of Community policies.\n(3)\nThe possibility of laying down national provisions with regard to the period of validity provided for in Directive 91/439/EEC leads to the co-existence of different rules in different Member States and over 110 different models of driving licences valid in the Member States. This creates problems of transparency for citizens, police forces and the administrations responsible for the administration of driving licences and leads to the falsification of documents which sometimes date back several decades.\n(4)\nIn order to prevent the single European driving licence model from becoming an additional model to the 110 already in circulation, Member States should take all necessary measures to issue this single model to all licence holders.\n(5)\nThis Directive should not prejudice existing entitlements to drive granted or acquired before its date of application.\n(6)\nDriving licences are mutually recognised. Member States should be able to apply the period of validity prescribed by this Directive to a licence without a limited administrative validity issued by another Member State and whose holder has resided on their territory for more than two years.\n(7)\nThe introduction of a period of administrative validity for new driving licences should make it possible to apply at the time of periodic renewal the most recent counter-falsification measures and the medical examinations or other measures provided for by the Member States.\n(8)\nOn road safety grounds, the minimum requirements for the issue of a driving licence should be laid down. Standards for driving tests and licensing need to be harmonised. To this end the knowledge, skills and behaviour connected with driving motor vehicles should be defined, the driving test should be based on these concepts and the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving such vehicles should be redefined.\n(9)\nProof of fulfilment of compliance with minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving by drivers of vehicles used for the transport of persons or goods should be provided when the driving licence is issued and periodically thereafter. Such regular control in accordance with national rules of compliance with minimum standards will contribute to the free movement of persons, avoid distortions of competition and better take into account the specific responsibility of drivers of such vehicles. Member States should be allowed to impose medical examinations as a guarantee of compliance with the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving other motor vehicles. For reasons of transparency, such examinations should coincide with a renewal of driving licences and therefore be determined by the period of validity of the licence.\n(10)\nIt is necessary to strengthen further the principle of progressive access to the categories of two-wheeled vehicles and to the categories of vehicles used for the transport of passengers and goods.\n(11)\nNevertheless, Member States should be allowed to set a higher age limit for the driving of certain categories of vehicles in order to further promote road safety; Member States should in exceptional circumstances be allowed to set lower age limits in order to take account of national circumstances.\n(12)\nThe definitions of the categories should reflect to a greater extent the technical characteristics of the vehicles concerned and the skills needed to drive a vehicle.\n(13)\nIntroducing a category of driving licences for mopeds will, in particular, increase road safety as regards the youngest drivers who, according to the statistics, are the hardest hit by road accidents.\n(14)\nSpecific provisions should be adopted to make it easier for physically disabled persons to drive vehicles.\n(15)\nFor reasons connected with road safety, Member States should be able to apply their national provisions on the withdrawal, suspension, renewal and cancellation of driving licences to all licence holders having acquired normal residence in their territory.\n(16)\nThe model driving licence as set out in Directive 91/439/EEC should be replaced by a single model in the form of a plastic card. At the same time, this model driving licence needs to be adapted on account of the introduction of a new category of driving licences for mopeds and of a new category of driving licences for motorcycles.\n(17)\nThe introduction of an optional microchip in the new plastic card model driving licence should enable the Member States to further improve the level of anti-fraud protection. Member States should have flexibility to include national data on the chip provided that it does not interfere with commonly accessible data. The technical requirements for the microchip should be determined by the Commission, assisted by the committee on driving licences.\n(18)\nMinimum standards concerning access to the profession of examiner and examiner training requirements should be established in order to improve the knowledge and skills of examiners thereby ensuring a more objective evaluation of driving licence applicants and achieving greater harmonisation of driving tests.\n(19)\nThe Commission should be allowed to undertake the adaptation of Annexes I to VI to scientific and technical progress.\n(20)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).\n(21)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to establish the criteria necessary for the application of this Directive. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(22)\nSince the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of their scale and their effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(23)\nThis Directive should not prejudice the obligations of the Member States relating to the deadlines for transposition into national law and application of the Directives listed in Annex VII, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nModel licence\n1.   Member States shall introduce a national driving licence based on the Community model set out in Annex I, in accordance with the provisions of this Directive. The emblem on page 1 of the Community model driving licences shall contain the distinguishing sign of the Member State issuing the licence.\n2.   Without prejudice to data protection rules, Member States may introduce a storage medium (microchip) as part of the driving licence, as soon as the requirements concerning the microchip referred to in Annex I, which are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, by supplementing it, are laid down by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9(2). These requirements shall provide for EC type-approval, which shall only be granted when the ability to resist attempts to tamper with or alter data is demonstrated.\n3.   The microchip shall incorporate the harmonised driving licence data specified in Annex I.\nAfter consulting the Commission, Member States may store additional data, provided that it does not in any way interfere with the implementation of this Directive.\nIn accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9(2), the Commission may amend Annex I in order to guarantee future interoperability.\n4.   With the agreement of the Commission, Member States may make to the model set out in Annex I such adjustments as are necessary for computer processing of the driving licence.\nArticle 2\nMutual recognition\n1.   Driving licences issued by Member States shall be mutually recognised.\n2.   When the holder of a valid national driving licence without the administrative validity period set out in Article 7(2) takes up normal residence in a Member State other than that which issued the driving licence, the host Member State may apply to the licence the administrative validity periods set out in that Article by renewing the driving licence, as from 2 years after the date on which the holder has taken up normal residence on its territory.\nArticle 3\nAnti-forgery measures\n1.   Member States shall take all necessary steps to avoid any risk of forgery of driving licences, including that of model driving licences issued before the entry into force of this Directive. They shall inform the Commission thereof.\n2.   The material used for the driving licence, as set out in Annex I, shall be made secure against forgery in application of specifications designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, by supplementing it, which are to be laid down by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9(2). Member States are free to introduce additional security features.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that, by 19 January 2033, all driving licences issued or in circulation fulfil all the requirements of this Directive.\nArticle 4\nCategories, definitions and minimum ages\n1.

Member States may, after consulting the Commission, authorise the driving on their territory of:\n(a)\nvehicles of category D1 (with a maximum authorised mass of 3 500 kg, excluding any specialised equipment intended for the carriage of disabled passengers) by holders over 21 years old of a driving licence for category B which was obtained at least two years earlier provided that the vehicles are being used by non-commercial bodies for social purposes and that the driver provides his services on a voluntary basis;\n(b)\nvehicles of a maximum authorised mass exceeding 3 500 kg by holders over 21 years old of a driving licence for category B which was obtained at least two years before, provided that the main purpose of the vehicles is to be used only when stationary as an instructional or recreational area, and that they are being used by non-commercial bodies for social purposes and that vehicles have been modified so that they may not be used either for the transport of more than nine persons or for the transport of any goods other than those strictly necessary for their purposes.\nArticle 7\nIssue, validity and renewal\n1.   Driving licences shall be issued only to those applicants:\n(a)\nwho have passed a test of skills and behaviour and a theoretical test and who meet medical standards, in accordance with the provisions of Annexes II and III;\n(b)\nwho have passed a theory test only as regards category AM; Member States may require applicants to pass a test of skills and behaviour and a medical examination for this category.\nFor tricycles and quadricycles within this category, Member States may impose a distinctive test of skills and behaviour. For the differentiation of vehicles in category AM, a national code may be inserted on the driving licence;\n(c)\nwho have, as regards category A2 or category A, on the condition of having acquired a minimum of 2 years' experience on a motorcycle in category A1 or in category A2 respectively, passed a test of skills and behaviour only, or completed a training pursuant to Annex VI;\n(d)\nwho have completed a training or passed a test of skills and behaviour, or completed a training and passed a test of skills and behaviour pursuant to Annex V as regards category B for driving a vehicle combination as defined in the second subparagraph of Article 4(4)(b);\n(e)\nwho have their normal residence in the territory of the Member State issuing the licence, or can produce evidence that they have been studying there for at least six months.\n2.\n(a)\nAs from 19 January 2013, licences issued by Member States for categories AM, A1, A2, A, B, B1 and BE shall have an administrative validity of 10 years.\nA Member State may choose to issue such licences with an administrative validity of up to 15 years;\n(b)\nAs from 19 January 2013, licences issued by Member States for categories C, CE, C1, C1E, D, DE, D1, D1E shall have an administrative validity of 5 years;\n(c)\nThe renewal of a driving licence may trigger a new administrative validity period for another category or categories the licence holder is entitled to drive, insofar as this is in conformity with the conditions laid down in this Directive;\n(d)\nThe presence of a microchip pursuant to Article 1 shall not be a prerequisite for the validity of a driving licence. The loss or unreadability of the microchip, or any other damage thereto, shall not affect the validity of the document.\n3.   The renewal of driving licences when their administrative validity expires shall be subject to:\n(a)\ncontinuing compliance with the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving set out in Annex III for driving licences in categories C, CE, C1, C1E, D, DE, D1, D1E; and\n(b)\nnormal residence in the territory of the Member State issuing the licence, or evidence that applicants have been studying there for at least six months.\nMember States may, when renewing driving licences in categories AM, A, A1, A2, B, B1 and BE, require an examination applying the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving set out in Annex III.\nMember States may limit the period of administrative validity set out in paragraph 2 of driving licences issued to novice drivers for any category in order to apply specific measures to such drivers, aiming at improving road safety.\nMember States may limit the period of administrative validity of the first licence issued to novice drivers for categories C and D to 3 years in order to be able to apply specific measures to such drivers, so as to improve their road safety.\nMember States may limit the period of administrative validity set out in paragraph 2 of individual driving licences for any category in case it is found necessary to apply an increased frequency of medical checks or other specific measures such as restrictions for traffic offenders.\nMember States may reduce the period of administrative validity set out in paragraph 2 of driving licences of holders residing on their territory having reached the age of 50 years in order to apply an increased frequency of medical checks or other specific measures such as refresher courses. This reduced period of administrative validity can only be applied upon renewing the driving licence.\n4.   Without prejudice to national criminal and police laws, Member States may, after consulting the Commission, apply to the issuing of driving licences the provisions of their national rules relating to conditions other than those referred to in this Directive.\n5.\n(a)\nNo person may hold more than one driving licence;\n(b)\nA Member State shall refuse to issue a licence where it establishes that the applicant already holds a driving licence;\n(c)\nMember States shall take the necessary measures pursuant to point (b). The necessary measures as regards the issue, replacement, renewal or exchange of a driving licence shall be to verify with other Member States where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the applicant is already the holder of another driving licence;\n(d)\nIn order to facilitate the checks pursuant to point (b), Member States shall use the EU driving licence network once it is operational.\nWithout prejudice to Article 2, a Member State issuing a licence shall apply due diligence to ensure that a person fulfils the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article and shall apply its national provisions on the cancellation or withdrawal of the right to drive if it is established that a licence has been issued without the requirements having been met.\nArticle 8\nAdaptation to scientific and technical progress\nThe amendments necessary to adapt Annexes I to VI to scientific and technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9(2).\nArticle 9\nCommittee\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the committee on driving licences.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4), and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nArticle 10\nExaminers\nFrom the entry into force of this Directive, driving examiners shall meet the minimum standards set out in Annex IV.\nDriving examiners already working in that capacity before 19 January 2013 shall be subject only to the requirements concerning quality assurance and regular periodic training measures.\nArticle 11\nVarious provisions concerning the exchange, the withdrawal, the replacement and the recognition of driving licences\n1.   Where the holder of a valid national driving licence issued by a Member State has taken up normal residence in another Member State, he may request that his driving licence be exchanged for an equivalent licence. It shall be for the Member State effecting the exchange to check for which category the licence submitted is in fact still valid.\n2.   Subject to observance of the principle of territoriality of criminal and police laws, the Member State of normal residence may apply its national provisions on the restriction, suspension, withdrawal or cancellation of the right to drive to the holder of a driving licence issued by another Member State and, if necessary, exchange the licence for that purpose.\n3.   The Member State effecting the exchange shall return the old licence to the authorities of the Member State which issued it and give the reasons for doing so.\n4.   A Member State shall refuse to issue a driving licence to an applicant whose driving licence is restricted, suspended or withdrawn in another Member State.\nA Member State shall refuse to recognise the validity of any driving licence issued by another Member State to a person whose driving licence is restricted, suspended or withdrawn in the former State's territory.\nA Member State may also refuse to issue a driving licence to an applicant whose licence is cancelled in another Member State.\n5.   A replacement for a driving licence which has, for example, been lost or stolen may only be obtained from the competent authorities of the Member State in which the holder has his normal residence; those authorities shall provide the replacement on the basis of the information in their possession or, where appropriate, proof from the competent authorities of the Member State which issued the original licence.\n6.   Where a Member State exchanges a driving licence issued by a third country for a Community model driving licence, such exchange shall be recorded on the Community model driving licence as shall any subsequent renewal or replacement.\nSuch an exchange may occur only if the licence issued by the third country has been surrendered to the competent authorities of the Member State making the exchange. If the holder of this licence transfers his normal residence to another Member State, the latter need not apply the principle of mutual recognition set out in Article 2.\nArticle 12\nNormal residence\nFor the purpose of this Directive, ‘normal residence’ means the place where a person usually lives, that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in the case of a person with no occupational ties, because of personal ties which show close links between that person and the place where he is living.\nHowever, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a different place from his personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in two or more Member States shall be regarded as being the place of his personal ties, provided that such person returns there regularly. This last condition need not be met where the person is living in a Member State in order to carry out a task of a definite duration. Attendance at a university or school shall not imply transfer of normal residence.\nArticle 13\nEquivalences between non-Community model licences\n1.   With the agreement of the Commission, Member States shall establish equivalences between entitlements obtained before the implementation of this Directive and the categories defined in Article 4.\nAfter consulting the Commission, Member States may make to their national legislation such adjustments as are necessary for the purpose of implementing the provisions of Article 11(4), (5) and (6).\n2.   Any entitlement to drive granted before 19 January 2013 shall not be removed or in any way qualified by the provisions of this Directive.\nArticle 14\nReview\nThe Commission shall report on the implementation of this Directive, including its impact on road safety, not earlier than 19 January 2018.\nArticle 15\nMutual Assistance\nMember States shall assist one another in the implementation of this Directive and shall exchange information on the licences they have issued, exchanged, replaced, renewed or revoked. They shall use the EU driving licence network set up for these purposes, once this network is operational.\nArticle 16\nTransposition\n1.   Member States shall adopt and publish, not later than 19 January 2011, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Article 1(1), Article 3, Article 4(1), (2), (3) and (4)(b) to (k), Article 6(1), (2)(a), (c), (d) and (e), Article 7(1)(b), (c) and (d), (2), (3) and (5), Article 8, Article 10, Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, and Annexes I, point 2, II, point 5.2 concerning categories A1, A2 and A, IV, V and VI. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.\n2.   They shall apply those provisions as from 19 January 2013.\n3.   When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication.

Marking of the test of skills and behaviour\n9.1.\nFor each of the abovementioned driving situations, the assessment must reflect the degree of ease with which the applicant handles the vehicle controls and his demonstrated capacity to drive in traffic in complete safety. The examiner must feel safe throughout the test. Driving errors or dangerous conduct immediately endangering the safety of the test vehicle, its passengers or other road users shall be penalised by failing the test, whether or not the examiner or accompanying person has to intervene. Nonetheless, the examiner shall be free to decide whether or not the skills and behaviour test should be completed.\nDriving examiners must be trained to assess correctly the applicants' ability to drive safely. The work of driving examiners must be monitored and supervised, by a body authorised by the Member State, to ensure correct and consistent application of fault assessment in accordance with the standards laid down in this Annex.\n9.2.\nDuring their assessment, driving examiners shall pay special attention to whether an applicant is showing a defensive and social driving behaviour. This should reflect the overall style of driving and the driving examiner should take this into account in the overall picture of the applicant. It includes adapted and determined (safe) driving, taking into account road and weather conditions, taking into account other traffic, taking into account the interests of other road users (particularly the more vulnerable) and anticipation.\n9.3.\nThe driving examiner will furthermore assess whether the applicant is:\n9.3.1.\nControlling the vehicle; taking into account: proper use of safety belts, rear-view mirrors, head restraints; seat; proper use of lights and other equipment; proper use of clutch, gearbox, accelerator, braking systems (including third braking system, if available), steering; controlling the vehicle under different circumstances, at different speeds; steadiness on the road; the weight and dimensions and characteristics of the vehicle; the weight and type of load (categories BE, C, CE, C1, C1E, DE, D1E only); the comfort of the passengers (categories D, DE, D1, D1E only) (no fast acceleration, smoothly driving and no hard braking);\n9.3.2.\nDriving economically and in an environmentally friendly way, taking into account the revolutions per minute, changing gears, braking and accelerating (categories BE, C, CE, C1, C1E, D, DE, D1, D1E only);\n9.3.3.\nObservation: all-round observation; proper use of mirrors; far, middle, near distance vision;\n9.3.4.\nPriority/giving way: priority at crossroads, intersections and junctions; giving way at other occasions (e.g. changing direction, changing lanes, special manoeuvres);\n9.3.5.\nCorrect position on the road: proper position on the road, in lanes, on roundabouts, round bends, suitable for the type and the characteristics of the vehicle; pre-positioning;\n9.3.6.\nKeeping distance: keeping adequate distance to the front and the side; keeping adequate distance from other road users;\n9.3.7.\nSpeed: not exceeding the maximum allowed speed; adapting speed to weather/traffic conditions and where appropriate up to national speed limits; driving at such a speed that stopping within distance of the visible and free road is possible; adapting speed to general speed of same kind of road users;\n9.3.8.\nTraffic lights, road signs and other indications: acting correctly at traffic lights; obeying instructions from traffic controllers; acting correctly at road signs (prohibitions or commands); take appropriate action at road markings;\n9.3.9.\nSignalling: give signals where necessary, correctly and properly timed; indicating directions correctly; taking appropriate action with regard to all signals made by other road users;\n9.3.10.\nBraking and stopping: decelerating in time, braking or stopping according to circumstances; anticipation; using the various braking systems (only for categories C, CE, D, DE); using speed reduction systems other than the brakes (only for categories C, CE, D, DE).\n10.   Length of the test\nThe length of the test and the distance travelled must be sufficient to assess the skills and behaviour laid down in paragraph B of this Annex. In no circumstances should the time spent driving on the road be less than 25 minutes for categories A, A1, A2, B, B1 and BE and 45 minutes for the other categories. This does not include the reception of the applicant, the preparation of the vehicle, the technical check of the vehicle with a bearing on road safety, the special manoeuvres and the announcement of the outcome of the practical test.\n11.   Location of the test\nThe part of the test to assess the special manoeuvres may be conducted on a special testing ground. Wherever practicable, the part of the test to assess behaviour in traffic should be conducted on roads outside built-up areas, expressways and motorways (or similar), as well as on all kinds of urban streets (residential areas, 30 and 50 km/h areas, urban expressways) which should represent the various types of difficulty likely to be encountered by drivers. It is also desirable for the test to take place in various traffic density conditions. The time spent driving on the road should be used in an optimal way to assess the applicant in all the various traffic areas that can be encountered, with a special emphasis on changing between these areas.\nII.   KNOWLEDGE, SKILL AND BEHAVIOUR FOR DRIVING A POWER-DRIVEN VEHICLE\nDrivers of all power-driven vehicles must at any moment have the knowledge, skills and behaviour described under points 1 to 9, with a view to be able to:\n—\nRecognise traffic dangers and assess their seriousness,\n—\nHave sufficient command of their vehicle not to create dangerous situations and to react appropriately should such situations occur,\n—\nComply with road traffic regulations, and in particular those intended to prevent road accidents and to maintain the flow of traffic,\n—\nDetect any major technical faults in their vehicles, in particular those posing a safety hazard, and have them remedied in an appropriate fashion,\n—\nTake account of all the factors affecting driving behaviour (e.g. alcohol, fatigue, poor eyesight, etc.) so as to retain full use of the faculties needed to drive safely,\n—\nHelp ensure the safety of all road users, and in particular of the weakest and most exposed by showing due respect for others.\nMember States may implement the appropriate measures to ensure that drivers who have lost the knowledge, skills and behaviour as described under points 1 to 9 can recover this knowledge and these skills and will continue to exhibit such behaviour required for driving a motor vehicle.\n(1)  OJ L 370, 31.12.1985, p. 1. Regulation as repealed by Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 102, 11.4.2006, p. 1).\n(2)  OJ L 370, 31.12.1985, p. 8.

Where there is reason to doubt that the applicant's vision is adequate, he shall be examined by a competent medical authority. At this examination attention shall be paid the following in particular: visual acuity, field of vision, twilight vision and progressive eye diseases.\nFor the purpose of this Annex, intra-ocular lenses shall not be considered corrective lenses.\nGroup 1:\n6.1.\nApplicants for a driving licence or for the renewal of such a licence shall have a binocular visual acuity, with corrective lenses if necessary, of at least 0,5 when using both eyes together. Driving licences shall not be issued or renewed if, during the medical examination, it is shown that the horizontal field of vision is less than 120o\no, apart from exceptional cases duly justified by a favourable medical opinion and a positive practical test, or that the person concerned suffers from any other eye condition that would compromise safe driving. When a progressive eye disease is detected or declared, driving licences may be issued or renewed subject to the applicant undergoing regular examination by a competent medical authority.\n6.2.\nApplicants for a driving licence, or for the renewal of such a licence, who have total functional loss of vision in one eye or who use only one eye (e.g. in the case of diplopia) must have a visual acuity of at least 0,6, with corrective lenses if necessary. The competent medical authority must certify that this condition of monocular vision has existed sufficiently long to allow adaptation and that the field of vision in this eye is normal.\nGroup 2:\n6.3.\nApplicants for a driving licence or for the renewal of such a licence must have a visual acuity, with corrective lenses if necessary, of at least 0,8 in the better eye and at least 0,5 in the worse eye. If corrective lenses are used to attain the values of 0,8 and 0,5, the uncorrected acuity in each eye must reach 0,05, or else the minimum acuity (0,8 and 0,5) must be achieved either by correction by means of glasses with a power not exceeding plus or minus 8 dioptres or with the aid of contact lenses (uncorrected vision = 0,05). The correction must be well tolerated. Driving licences shall not be issued to or renewed for applications or drivers without a normal binocular field of vision or suffering from diplopia.\nHEARING\n7.\nDriving licences may be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers in Group 2 subject to the opinion of the competent medical authorities; particular account will be taken in medical examinations of the scope for compensation.\nPERSONS WITH A LOCOMOTOR DISABILITY\n8.\nDriving licences shall not be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers suffering from complaints or abnormalities of the locomotor system which make it dangerous to drive a power-driven vehicle.\nGroup 1:\n8.1.\nDriving licences subject to certain restrictions, if necessary, may be issued to physically disabled applicants or drivers following the issuing of an opinion by a competent medical authority. This opinion must be based on a medical assessment of the complaint or abnormality in question and, where necessary, on a practical test. It must also indicate what type of modification to the vehicle is required and whether the driver needs to be fitted with an orthopaedic device, insofar as the test of skills and behaviour demonstrates that with such a device driving would not to be dangerous.\n8.2.\nDriving licences may be issued to or renewed for any applicant suffering from a progressive complaint on condition that the disabled person is regularly examined to check that the person is still capable of driving the vehicle completely safely.\nWhere the disability is static, driving licences may be issued or renewed without the applicant being subject to regular medical examination.\nGroup 2:\n8.3.\nThe competent medical authority shall give due consideration to the additional risks and dangers involved in the driving of vehicles covered by the definition of this group.\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\n9.\nAny disease capable of exposing an applicant for a first licence or a driver applying for renewal to a sudden failure of the cardiovascular system such that there is a sudden impairment of the cerebral functions constitutes a danger to road safety.\nGroup 1:\n9.1.\nDriving licences will not to be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers with serious arrhythmia.\n9.2.\nDriving licences may be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers wearing a pacemaker subject to authorised medical opinion and regular medical check-ups.\n9.3.\nThe question of whether to issue or renew a licence for applicants or drivers suffering from abnormal arterial blood pressure shall be assessed with reference to the other results of the examination, any associated complications and the danger they might constitute for road safety.\n9.4.\nGenerally speaking, a driving licence shall not be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers suffering from angina during rest or emotion.

driving licences\nSUMMARY OF\nDirective 2006/126/EC on driving licences\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt introduces a new European driving licence.\nIt recasts Directive 91/439/EEC – which it also repeals.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive does the following.\nIt helps to improve road safety: it introduces a new category of licence for mopeds and requires a mandatory theory test beforehand as well as a graduated access to heavier motorcycles. It further specifies testing requirements. Professional drivers must have medical checks every 5 years. Requirements are laid down for the qualification and training of driving examiners.\nIt facilitates free movement of people: it introduces a European driving licence model and establishes a network for the exchange of information on driving licences between European Union (EU) Member States, simplifying the administrative work required for the mutual recognition of driving licences.\nIt reduces the scope for fraud: the new licence has a microchip incorporating the information printed on the card. It introduces a validity period for car and motorcycle licences of 10–15 years to allow for a regular update on the protection features and the holders. It sets up a new electronic network to ease communication between national authorities for licence checks.\nMutual recognition of licences\nLicences issued by Member States must be mutually recognised. The driving licence categories are as follows:\ncategory AM – for 2-wheel and 3-wheel vehicles with a maximum design speed of not more than 45 km/h, as well as light quadricycles;\ncategory A1 – for light motorcycles with a cylinder capacity not more than 125 cubic centimetres and a power rating less than 11 kW;\ncategory A2 – for motorcycles with a power rating under 35 kW;\ncategory A – for heavy motorcycles without power restrictions;\ncategory B – for passenger vehicles weighing up to 3,500 kg and seating not more than eight passengers;\ncategory BE – for a vehicle of category B towing a heavy trailer of under 3,500 kg;\ncategory B1 (optional) – for quadricycles;\ncategory C1 – for goods vehicles between 3,500 kg and 7,500 kg and for up to eight passengers;\ncategory C1E – for a vehicle of category C1 or B towing a heavy trailer; with a combined mass of up to 12,000 kg;\ncategory C – for goods vehicles weighing more than 3,500 kg and seating not more than eight passengers;\ncategory CE – for a vehicle of category C towing a heavy trailer;\ncategory D1 – for passenger vehicles built for fewer than 16 passengers and that is no longer than 8 m;\ncategory D1E – for a vehicle of category D1 towing a heavy trailer;\ncategory D – for passenger vehicles for more than eight passengers;\ncategory DE – for a vehicle of category D towing a heavy trailer;\nlight trailers up to 750 kg may be towed with categories B, C1, C, D1 and D.\nA table of equivalences between these categories and those set out in licences issued in Member States prior to this directive are contained in Decision (EU) 2016/1945.\nConditions for issuing licences\nLicences must state the conditions subject to which the driver is authorised to drive. If driving is authorised only for certain types of vehicle or for adapted vehicles, then this should be indicated by a code in the licence.\nThe issue of licences is also subject to conditions: licences for categories C1, C, D1 and D are only issued to drivers already entitled to drive category B vehicles;licences for categories BE, C1E, CE, D1E and DE are only issued to drivers already entitled to drive category B, C1, C, D1 and D vehicles, respectively.\nThe minimum age for the issue of driving licences is 16 years for categories AM, A1 (light motorcycles) and B1 (motor-powered tricycles and quadricycles)18 years for categories A2, B, BE and C121 years for categories C, CE, D1 and D1E24 years for categories D and DE;\nMember States may raise or lower the minimum age, within given limits, for certain categories.\nMember States must ensure that licence applicants possess the knowledge and skills and exhibit the behaviour required for driving a motor vehicle. In general, the tests to this effect must involve a theory testa test of skills and behaviour.\nDriving licence examiners\nThey must have minimum competences for the skills and behaviour test.\nThey are under a quality-assurance regime and have to undergo periodic training.\nAmendments following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\nDue to difficulties in renewing driving licences as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, which had started by 1 February 2020 in some Member States, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extends the validity of certain driving licences for a period of 7 months from their date of expiry, in order to ensure the continuity of mobility by road.\nWhere a Member State considers that the renewal of driving licences is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to its COVID-19-related measures, it must submit by 1 August 2020 a reasoned request for an authorisation by the European Commission to extend the periods in question.\nIn view of the persistence of the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2021/267 lays down specific and temporary measures concerning the renewal or extension of licences and authorisations and the extension of certain periods referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698. The measures are described below. The validity of driving licences which expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 is deemed to be extended for a period of 10 months from their date of expiry.The validity of the driving licences which, by application of Regulation (EU) 2020/698 would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021, are deemed to be, or to have been, extended for 6 months or until 1 July 2021, whichever is the later.Where a Member State considers that the renewal of driving licences is likely to remain impracticable beyond 30 June 2021, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID-19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the above periods. That request may concern the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 or the period of 10 months, or both. It must be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2021.If the requirements are fulfilled and the requested extension does not lead to disproportionate risks in terms of transport safety and security, the Commission can authorise the Member State concerned to apply an extension. The extension must be limited to reflect the period during which the renewal of driving licences is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, cannot exceed 6 months. The Commission’s decision in this regard is published in the Official Journal of the European Union.Where a Member State does not need to avail of the measures laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/267, it should inform the Commission of this by 3 March 2021.
