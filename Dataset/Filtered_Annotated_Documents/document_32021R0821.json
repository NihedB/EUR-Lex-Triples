{"celex_id": "32021R0821", "reference": "11.6.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 206/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2021/821 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 May 2021\nsetting up a Union regime for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items (recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 (2) has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity, effectiveness and efficiency.\n(2)\nThis Regulation aims to ensure that in the area of dual-use items, the Union and its Member States fully take into account all relevant considerations. Relevant considerations include international obligations and commitments, obligations under relevant sanctions, considerations of national foreign and security policy including those contained in the Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP (3), among them human rights, and considerations about intended end-use and the risk of diversion. Through this Regulation, the Union demonstrates its commitment to maintaining robust legal requirements with regard to dual-use items, as well as to strengthening the exchange of relevant information and greater transparency. With regard to cyber-surveillance items, the competent authorities of the Member States should consider in particular the risk of them being used in connection with internal repression or the commission of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.\n(3)\nThis Regulation also aims to strengthen the guidance to be given to exporters, in particular to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), regarding responsible practices, yet without impairing the global competitiveness of exporters of dual-use items or other associated industry or academia which are resident or established in a Member State.\n(4)\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004), adopted on 28 April 2004, decided that all States are to take and enforce effective measures to establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery, including by establishing appropriate controls over related materials, equipment and technology. Controls are also required under relevant international agreements, such as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (the ‘Chemical Weapons Convention’ or ‘CWC’) and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and On Their Destruction (the ‘Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention’ or ‘BWC’), and in line with commitments agreed upon in multilateral export control regimes.\n(5)\nAn effective common system of export controls on dual-use items is therefore necessary to ensure that the international commitments and responsibilities of the Member States and of the Union, in particular regarding non-proliferation, regional peace, security and stability and respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, are complied with.\n(6)\nThe EU Strategy against proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction of 12 December 2003 (‘EU WMD Strategy’) emphasises the Union’s commitment to strong national and internationally coordinated export controls.\n(7)\nThe contribution of exporters, brokers, providers of technical assistance or other relevant stakeholders to the overall aim of trade controls is crucial. In order for them to be able to act in conformity with this Regulation, the assessment of risks related to transactions concerned by this Regulation is to be carried out through transaction-screening measures, also known as the due diligence principle, as a part of an Internal Compliance Programme (ICP). In that regard, in particular the size and organisational structure of exporters have to be taken into account when developing and implementing ICPs.\n(8)\nIn order to address the risk that certain non-listed cyber-surveillance items exported from the customs territory of the Union might be misused by persons complicit in or responsible for directing or committing serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law, it is appropriate to place the export of such items under control. Associated risks relate, in particular, to cases where cyber-surveillance items are specially designed to enable intrusion or deep packet inspection into information and telecommunications systems in order to conduct covert surveillance of natural persons by monitoring, extracting, collecting or analysing data, including biometrics data, from those systems. Items used for purely commercial applications such as billing, marketing, quality services, user satisfaction or network security are generally considered not to entail such risks.\n(9)\nWith a view to strengthening the effective control of exports of non-listed cyber-surveillance items, it is essential to further harmonise the application of catch-all controls in that area. To that end, Member States are committed to supporting such controls by sharing information amongst themselves and with the Commission, in particular regarding technological developments of cyber-surveillance items, and by exercising vigilance in the application of such controls to promote an exchange at Union level.\n(10)\nIn order to enable the Union to react rapidly to the serious misuse of existing technologies or to new risks associated with emerging technologies, a mechanism should be introduced to enable Member States to coordinate their responses when a new risk is identified. Such coordination should be followed by initiatives to introduce equivalent controls at the multilateral level in order to broaden the response to the identified risk.\n(11)\nTransmission of dual-use software and technology by means of electronic media, fax or telephone to destinations outside the customs territory of the Union should also be controlled. In order to limit the administrative burden for exporters and the competent authorities of the Member States, general or global licenses or harmonised interpretations of provisions should be provided for certain transmissions, such as transmissions to a cloud.\n(12)\nConsidering the important role of customs authorities in the enforcement of export controls, the terms used in this Regulation should, to the extent possible, be consistent with the definitions set out in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) (the ‘Union Customs Code’).\n(13)\nVarious categories of persons can be involved in the export of dual-use items, including natural persons such as service providers, researchers, consultants and persons transmitting dual-use items electronically. It is essential that all such persons are aware of the risks associated with the export and the provision of technical assistance regarding sensitive items. In particular, academic and research institutions face distinct challenges in export control due to, inter alia, their general commitment to the free exchange of ideas, the fact that their research work often involves cutting edge technologies, their organisational structures and the international nature of their scientific exchanges. Member States and the Commission should, where necessary, raise awareness among the academic and research community and provide them with tailored guidance to address those distinct challenges. In alignment with multilateral export control regimes, the implementation of controls should provide, to the extent possible, for a common approach with respect to certain provisions, in particular regarding the academia related de-control notes ‘basic scientific research’ and ‘public domain’.\n(14)\nThe definition of the term ‘broker’ should be revised to include legal persons and partnerships not resident or established in a Member State and that provide brokering services from the customs territory of the Union.\n(15)\nThe Lisbon Treaty clarifies that the provision of technical assistance involving a cross-border movement falls under Union competence. It is therefore appropriate to introduce a definition of technical assistance and to specify the controls applicable to its provision. In addition, for reasons of effectiveness and consistency, controls on the provision of technical assistance should be harmonised.\n(16)\nAs in Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, it should be possible for Member States’ authorities to prohibit the transit of non-Union dual-use items under certain circumstances where, through intelligence or other sources, they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the items are or might be intended, in their entirety or in part, for a military end-use in a country that is subject to an arms embargo, or for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery.\n(17)\nLicensing conditions and requirements should be harmonised, where appropriate, in order to avoid distortions of competition and to ensure the consistent and effective application of controls throughout the customs territory of the Union. To that effect, it is also necessary that the competent authorities of the Member States are clearly identified in all control situations. The responsibility for deciding on individual, global or national general export authorisations, on authorisations for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance, on transits of non-Union dual-use items and on authorisations for the transfer within the customs territory of the Union of dual-use items listed in Annex IV, lies with national authorities.\n(18)\nGuidelines for Internal Compliance Programmes should be introduced in order to contribute to achieving the level-playing field between exporters and to enhance the effective application of controls. Such guidelines should take into account the differences in sizes, resources, fields of activity and other features and conditions of exporters and their subsidiaries, such as intra-group compliance structures and standards, thereby avoiding a ‘one model for all’ approach and helping each exporter to find its own solutions for compliance and competitiveness. Exporters using global export authorisations should implement an ICP unless the competent authority considers it unnecessary due to other circumstances it has taken into account when processing the application for a global export authorisation submitted by the exporter.\n(19)\nAdditional Union general export authorisations should be introduced in order to reduce the administrative burden on companies, in particular SMEs, and authorities, while ensuring an appropriate level of control of the relevant items to the relevant destinations. Where necessary, Member States can provide guidance to exporters regarding the application of general authorisations. Member States can also introduce national general export authorisations for low-risk exports where they consider it necessary. An authorisation for large projects should also be introduced to adapt licensing conditions to the particular needs of industry.\n(20)\nThe Commission, in close consultation with Member States and stakeholders, should develop guidelines and/or recommendations for best practices to support practical application of controls. When preparing the guidelines and/or recommendations, the Commission should have due regard to the information needs of SMEs.\n(21)\nCommon lists of dual-use items, destinations and guidelines are essential elements for an effective export control regime.\n(22)\nMember States that establish national control lists pursuant to this Regulation should inform the Commission and the other Member States of such lists. Member States should also inform the Commission and the other Member States of all decisions to refuse an authorisation for an export for which an authorisation is required on the basis of a national control list.\n(23)\nIn order to allow for a swift Union response to changing circumstances as regards the assessment of the sensitivity of exports under Union general export authorisations as well as technological and commercial developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annexes I, II and IV to this Regulation. Decisions to update the common list of dual-use items subject to export controls set out in Annex I should be in conformity with the obligations and commitments that Member States or the Union have accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation agreements and as members of multilateral export control regimes or by ratification of relevant international treaties. Where the amendment of Annex I concerns dual-use items which are also listed in Annex II or IV, those Annexes should be amended accordingly. Decisions to update the common lists of items and destinations set out in Sections A to H of Annex II should be made having regard to the assessment criteria set out in this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (5). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(24)\nThe Commission should publish the updates to Annex I through delegated acts in all the official languages of the Union.\n(25)\nThe Commission should publish and keep updated a compilation of national control lists in force in the Member States in all the official languages of the Union.\n(26)\nNational provisions and decisions affecting exports of dual-use items should be taken in the framework of the common commercial policy, and in particular Regulation (EU) 2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). Appropriate exchange of information and consultations on national provisions and decisions should ensure the effective and consistent application of controls throughout the customs territory of the Union.\n(27)\nThe existence of a common control system is a prerequisite for establishing the free movement of dual-use items inside the customs territory of the Union.\n(28)\nPursuant to and within the limits of Article 36 TFEU and in accordance with international obligations undertaken, Member States retain the right to carry out controls on transfers of certain dual-use items within the customs territory of the Union in order to safeguard public policy or public security. The list of items subject to intra-Union transfer controls set out in Annex IV should be periodically reviewed taking into account the further evolution of the underlying international obligations, as well as technological and commercial developments as regards the assessment of the sensitivity of transfers. Decisions to update the common list of dual-use items subject to export controls set out in Annex IV should be made having regard to Article 36 TFEU, namely the public policy and public security interests of the Member States.\n(29)\nOn 22 September 1998, the Member States and the Commission signed Protocols additional to the respective safeguards agreements between the Member States, the European Atomic Energy Community and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which, among other measures, oblige the Member States to provide information on transfers of specified equipment and non-nuclear material. Intra-Union transfer controls should allow the Union and its Member States to fulfil their obligations under those agreements.\n(30)\nIn order to achieve uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the Union, it is appropriate to broaden the scope of consultation and information exchange between the Member States and the Commission, and to introduce tools to support the development of a common export control network throughout the Union, such as electronic licensing procedures, technical expert groups and the setting up of an enforcement coordination mechanism. It is of particular importance to ensure that exporters, brokers, providers of technical assistance and other relevant stakeholders concerned by this Regulation, including industry and civil society organisations, are consulted, where appropriate, by the Dual-Use Coordination Group and the technical expert groups.\n(31)\nWhile customs authorities share certain information with other customs authorities using a risk management system in accordance with Union customs rules, it is also appropriate to ensure close cooperation between licensing and customs authorities.\n(32)\nIt is appropriate to clarify that, to the extent that it concerns personal data, the processing and exchange of information should comply with the applicable rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data laid down in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (7) and (EU) 2018/1725 (8) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n(33)\nMember States and the Commission should take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of confidential information in compliance with, in particular, Commission Decisions (EU, Euratom) 2015/443 (9)and (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 (10) and the Agreement between the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council, regarding the protection of classified information exchanged in the interests of the European Union (11). This includes, in particular, the obligation not to downgrade or declassify classified information without the prior written consent of the originator. Any non-classified sensitive information or information which is provided on a confidential basis should be handled as such by the authorities.\n(34)\nOutreach to the private sector, in particular to SMEs, and transparency are essential elements for an effective export control regime. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the continued development of guidelines, where necessary, to support the application of this Regulation and for the publication of a Union annual report on the implementation of controls.\n(35)\nThe Union annual report on the implementation of controls should include relevant information on the licensing and enforcement of controls under this Regulation, with due respect to the need to ensure the protection of the confidentiality of certain data, in particular where the publication of licensing data could affect national security concerns raised by Member States or jeopardise commercial confidentiality and allow non-Union suppliers to undercut restrictive licensing decisions by Member States.\n(36)\nIn order to ensure that this Regulation is properly applied, each Member State should take measures to give the competent authorities appropriate powers.\n(37)\nIn accordance with the EU WMD Strategy, each Member State should determine effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties applicable in the event of infringements of the provisions of this Regulation. It is also appropriate to introduce provisions to support the effective enforcement of controls, among other things through an enforcement coordination mechanism.\n(38)\nThe Union Customs Code lays down, among other things, provisions relating to the export and re-export of goods. Nothing in this Regulation constrains any powers under and pursuant to the Union Customs Code and its implementing provisions.\n(39)\nExport controls contribute to international security and have an impact on trade with third countries. It is therefore appropriate to develop dialogue and cooperation with third countries in order to support a global level-playing field and enhance international security. In particular, Member States and the Commission should enhance their contribution to the activities of multilateral export control regimes. Member States and the Commission should also support those regimes in developing robust export controls as a global basis and model for international best practice, and an important tool for ensuring international peace and stability. Contributions should be made when a new risk has been identified by all Member States in the field of cyber-surveillance items in order to ensure a multilateral level playing field.\n(40)\nThis Regulation applies without prejudice to the Commission Delegated Decision of 15 September 2015 supplementing Decision No 1104/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), which establishes specific rules for the control of the export of items for the Public Regulated Service under the Galileo Programme.\n(41)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation establishes a Union regime for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘dual-use items’ means items, including software and technology, which can be used for both civil and military purposes, and includes items which can be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or their means of delivery, including all items which can be used for both non-explosive uses and assisting in any way in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices;\n(2)\n‘export’ means:\n(a)\nan export procedure within the meaning of Article 269 of the Union Customs Code;\n(b)\na re-export within the meaning of Article 270 of the Union Customs Code; a re-export also occurs if, during a transit through the customs territory of the Union according to point (11) of this Article, an exit summary declaration has to be lodged because the final destination of the items has been changed;\n(c)\nan outward processing procedure within the meaning of Article 259 of the Union Customs Code; or\n(d)\ntransmission of software or technology by electronic media, including by fax, telephone, electronic mail or any other electronic means to a destination outside the customs territory of the Union; it includes making available in an electronic form such software and technology to natural or legal persons or to partnerships outside the customs territory of the Union; it also includes the oral transmission of technology when the technology is described over a voice transmission medium;\n(3)\n‘exporter’ means:\n(a)\nany natural or legal person or any partnership that, at the time when the export declaration or the re-export declaration or an exit summary declaration is accepted, holds the contract with the consignee in the third country and has the power to determine the sending of the items out of the customs territory of the Union; where no export contract has been concluded or if the holder of the contract does not act on its own behalf, exporter means the person who has the power to determine the sending of the items out of the customs territory of the Union; or\n(b)\nany natural or legal person or any partnership that decides to transmit software or technology by electronic media, including by fax, telephone, electronic mail or by any other electronic means to a destination outside the customs territory of the Union or to make available in an electronic form such software and technology to natural or legal persons or to partnerships outside the customs territory of the Union.\nWhere the benefit of a right to dispose of the dual-use item belongs to a person resident or established outside the customs territory of the Union pursuant to the contract on which the export is based, the exporter shall be considered to be the contracting party resident or established in the customs territory of the Union;\n(c)\nwhere point (a) or (b) is not applicable, any natural person carrying the dual-use items to be exported where these dual-use items are contained in the person’s personal baggage within the meaning of point (a) of Article 1(19) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 (13);\n(4)\n‘export declaration’ means an act whereby any natural or legal person or any partnership indicates, in the prescribed form and manner, the wish to place dual-use items specified in point (1) under an export procedure;\n(5)\n‘re-export declaration’ means an act within the meaning of Article 5(13) of the Union Customs Code;\n(6)\n‘exit summary declaration’ means an act within the meaning of Article 5(10) of the Union Customs Code;\n(7)\n‘brokering services’ means:\n(a)\nthe negotiation or arrangement of transactions for the purchase, sale or supply of dual-use items from a third country to any other third country; or\n(b)\nthe selling or buying of dual-use items that are located in third countries for their transfer to another third country.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the sole provision of ancillary services is excluded from this definition.

Where an exporter is aware, according to its due diligence findings, that cyber-surveillance items which the exporter proposes to export, not listed in Annex I, are intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the exporter shall notify the competent authority. That competent authority shall decide whether or not to make the export concerned subject to authorisation. The Commission and the Council shall make available guidelines for exporters, as referred to in Article 26(1).\n3.   A Member State may adopt or maintain national legislation imposing an authorisation requirement on the export of cyber-surveillance items not listed in Annex I if the exporter has grounds for suspecting that those items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n4.   A Member State which imposes an authorisation requirement pursuant to paragraph 1, 2 or 3 shall immediately inform its customs authorities and other relevant national authorities and shall provide the other Member States and the Commission with relevant information on the authorisation requirement in question, in particular as regards the items and entities concerned, unless it considers that it is not appropriate to do so in light of the nature of the transaction or the sensitivity of the information concerned.\n5.   Member States shall give due consideration to information received pursuant to paragraph 4 and shall review it in light of the criteria set out in paragraph 1 within 30 working days. They shall inform their customs authorities and other relevant national authorities. In exceptional cases, any Member State may request the extension of that 30-day period. However, the extension shall not exceed 30 working days.\n6.   Where all Member States notify each other and the Commission that an authorisation requirement should be imposed for essentially identical transactions, the Commission shall publish in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union information regarding the cyber-surveillance items and, where appropriate, destinations subject to authorisation requirements as notified by Member States for that purpose.\n7.   Member States shall review the information published pursuant to paragraph 6 at least annually, on the basis of relevant information and analyses provided by the Commission.

In order to allow for an examination of all valid denials by the Member States, Article 16(1), (2) and (5) to (7) shall apply to cases concerning cyber-surveillance items not listed in Annex I.\n9.   All exchanges of information required pursuant to this Article shall take place in accordance with the legal requirements concerning the protection of personal information, commercially sensitive information or protected defence, foreign policy or national security information. Such exchanges of information shall be made via secure electronic means, including through the system referred to in Article 23(6).\n10.   Member States shall consider supporting the inclusion of items published pursuant to paragraph 6 of this Article in the appropriate international non-proliferation regimes or export control arrangements with a view to extending controls. The Commission shall provide analyses of the relevant data gathered pursuant to Article 23(2) and to Article 26(2).\n11.   This Regulation is without prejudice to the right of Member States to take national measures under Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2015/479.\nArticle 6\n1.   An authorisation shall be required for the provision of brokering services of dual-use items listed in Annex I if the broker has been informed by the competent authority that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1).\n2.   Where a broker proposes to provide brokering services of dual-use items listed in Annex I and is aware that those items are intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1), the broker shall notify the competent authority. That competent authority shall decide whether or not to make such brokering services subject to authorisation.\n3.   A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items.\n4.   A Member State may adopt or maintain national legislation imposing an authorisation requirement on the provision of brokering services of dual-use items if the broker has grounds for suspecting that those items are or may be intended for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1).\n5.   Article 9(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article.\nArticle 7\n1.   The transit of non-Union dual-use items listed in Annex I may be prohibited at any time by the competent authority of the Member State where the items are situated if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1).\n2.   Before deciding whether or not to prohibit a transit the competent authority may, in individual cases, impose an authorisation requirement for the specific transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1). If the transit takes place through the territory of multiple Member States, the competent authority of each affected Member State shall be able to prohibit such transit through its territory.\nThe competent authority may impose the authorisation requirement on the natural or legal person or the partnership that holds the contract with the consignee in the third country and has the power to determine the sending of the items passing through the customs territory of the Union.\nIf the natural or legal person or the partnership is not resident or established in the customs territory of the Union, the competent authority may impose the authorisation requirement on:\n(a)\nthe declarant within the meaning of Article 5(15) of the Union Customs Code;\n(b)\nthe carrier within the meaning of Article 5(40) of the Union Customs Code; or\n(c)\nthe natural person carrying the dual-use items in transit where those dual-use items are contained in the personal baggage of that person.\n3.   A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items.\n4.   Article 9(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.\nArticle 8\n1.   An authorisation shall be required for the provision of technical assistance related to dual-use items listed in Annex I if the provider of technical assistance has been informed by the competent authority that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1).\n2.   Where a provider of technical assistance proposes to provide technical assistance for dual-use items listed in Annex I and is aware that those items are intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1), the provider of technical assistance shall notify the competent authority. That competent authority shall decide whether or not to make such technical assistance subject to authorisation.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the technical assistance:\n(a)\nis provided within or into the territory of a country listed in Part 2 of Section A of Annex II, or towards a resident of a country listed in Part 2 of Section A of Annex II;\n(b)\ntakes the form of transferring information that is in the public domain or basic scientific research within the meaning of the General Technology Note or of the Nuclear Technology Note set out in Annex I;\n(c)\nis provided by authorities or agencies of a Member State in the context of their official tasks;\n(d)\nis provided for the armed forces of a Member State on the basis of the tasks assigned to them;\n(e)\nis provided for a purpose which is cited in the exceptions for items of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR technology) in Annex IV; or\n(f)\nis the minimum necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking) or repair of those items for which an export authorisation has been issued.\n4.   A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items.\n5.   A Member State may adopt or maintain national legislation imposing an authorisation requirement on the provision of technical assistance where a provider of technical assistance who proposes to provide technical assistance for dual-use items has grounds for suspecting that those items are or may be intended for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1).\n6.   Article 9(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article.\nArticle 9\n1.   A Member State may prohibit or impose an authorisation requirement on the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I for reasons of public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism, or for human rights considerations.\n2.   Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 without delay and indicate the precise reasons for the measures. If the measure is the establishment of a national control list, Member States shall also inform the Commission and the other Member States of the description of the controlled items.\n3.   Member States shall, without delay, notify the Commission and the other Member States of any amendment to measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 1, including any amendment to their national control lists.\n4.   The Commission shall publish the measures notified to it pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union. The Commission shall publish separately, without delay and in all the official languages of the Union, a compilation of national control lists in force in the Member States. The Commission shall, upon notification by a Member State of any amendment to its national control list, publish, without delay and in all the official languages of the Union, an update to the compilation of national control lists in force in the Member States.\nArticle 10\n1.   An authorisation shall be required for the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if another Member State imposes an authorisation requirement for the export of those items on the basis of a national control list of items adopted by that Member State pursuant to Article 9 and published by the Commission pursuant to Article 9(4), and if the exporter has been informed by the competent authority that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for uses of concern with respect to public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism, or to human rights considerations.\n2.   A Member State which refuses an authorisation required under paragraph 1 shall also inform the Commission and the other Member States of such decision.\n3.   A Member State which imposes an authorisation requirement pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article on the export of a dual-use item not listed in Annex I, shall inform its customs authorities and other relevant national authorities about the authorisation requirement without delay and, where appropriate, provide the other Member States and the Commission with the relevant information, in particular concerning the items and end-users concerned. The other Member States shall give due consideration to that information and shall inform their customs authorities and other relevant national authorities thereof.\nArticle 11\n1.   An authorisation shall be required for intra-Union transfers of dual-use items listed in Annex IV. Dual-use items listed in Part 2 of Annex IV shall not be covered by a general authorisation.\n2.   A Member State may impose an authorisation requirement for the transfer of other dual-use items from its territory to another Member State in cases where at the time of transfer:\n(a)\nthe operator or the competent authority knows that the final destination of the items concerned is outside the customs territory of the Union;\n(b)\nthe export of those items to that final destination is subject to an authorisation requirement pursuant to Article 3, 4, 5, 9 or 10 in the Member State from which the items are to be transferred, and such export directly from its territory is not authorised by a general authorisation or a global authorisation; and\n(c)\nno processing or working as defined in Article 60(2) of the Union Customs Code is to be performed on the items in the Member State to which they are to be transferred.\n3.   The transfer authorisation referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied for in the Member State from which the dual-use items are to be transferred.\n4.   In cases where the subsequent export of the dual-use items has already been accepted in the consultation procedures set out in Article 14 by the Member State from which the items are to be transferred, the transfer authorisation shall be issued to the operator immediately, unless the circumstances have substantially changed.\n5.   A Member State which adopts legislation imposing an authorisation requirement as referred to in paragraph 2 shall, without delay, inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures it has taken. The Commission shall publish that information in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\n6.   The application of measures taken pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not involve the application of internal frontier controls within the customs territory of the Union, but solely controls which are performed as part of the normal control procedures applied in a non-discriminatory fashion throughout the customs territory of the Union.\n7.   The application of measures taken pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not result in transfers from one Member State to another being subject to more restrictive conditions than those imposed for exports of the same items to third countries.\n8.   A Member State may, by national legislation, require that, for any intra-Union transfers from that Member State of items listed in Annex I, Category 5, Part 2, which are not listed in Annex IV, additional information concerning those items shall be provided to the competent authority of that Member State.\n9.   The relevant commercial documents relating to intra-Union transfers of dual-use items listed in Annex I shall indicate clearly that those items are subject to controls if exported from the customs territory of the Union. Such documents include, in particular, any sales contract, order confirmation, invoice or dispatch note.\nCHAPTER III\nEXPORT AUTHORISATION AND AUTHORISATION FOR BROKERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nArticle 12\n1.   The following types of authorisations for export may be issued or are established under this Regulation:\n(a)\nindividual export authorisations;\n(b)\nglobal export authorisations;\n(c)\nnational general export authorisations;\n(d)\nUnion general export authorisations for exports of certain items to certain destinations under specific conditions and requirements for use as set out in Sections A to H of Annex II.\nAuthorisations issued or established under this Regulation shall be valid throughout the customs territory of the Union.\n2.   Individual and global export authorisations under this Regulation shall be granted by the competent authority of the Member State where the exporter is resident or established.\nWithout prejudice to point (3) of Article 2, where the exporter is not resident or established on the customs territory of the Union, individual export authorisations shall be granted under this Regulation by the competent authority of the Member State where the dual-use items are located.\nAll individual and global export authorisations shall be issued, whenever possible, by electronic means on forms containing at least all the elements of and in the order provided for in the models set out in Section A of Annex III.\n3.   Individual export authorisations and global export authorisations shall be valid for up to two years, unless the competent authority decides otherwise.\nLarge project authorisations shall be valid for a duration to be determined by the competent authority, but no longer than four years, except in duly justified circumstances based on the duration of the project.\n4.   Exporters shall supply the competent authority with all relevant information required for their applications for individual and global export authorisations so as to provide complete information in particular about the end-user, the country of destination and the end-use of the item exported.\nIndividual export authorisations shall be subject to an end-use statement. The competent authority may exempt certain applications from the obligation of providing an end-use statement. Global export authorisations may be subject to an end-use statement if appropriate.\nExporters using global export authorisations shall implement an ICP, unless the competent authority considers it unnecessary due to other information it has taken into account when processing the application for a global export authorisation submitted by the exporter.\nReporting and ICP requirements relating to the use of global export authorisations shall be defined by Member States.\nAt the request of exporters, global export authorisations that contain quantitative limitations shall be split.\n5.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall process requests for individual or global authorisations within a period of time to be determined by national law or practice.\n6.   National general export authorisations shall:\n(a)\nexclude from their scope items listed in Section I of Annex II;\n(b)\nbe defined by national law or practice; they may be used by all exporters, resident or established in the Member State that issues those authorisations, if they meet the requirements set in this Regulation and in the complementary national legislation; they shall be issued in accordance with the indications set out in Section C of Annex III;\n(c)\nnot be used if the exporter has been informed by the competent authority that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1), or if the exporter is aware that the items are intended for such uses.\nNational general export authorisations may also apply to items and destinations listed in Sections A to H of Annex II.\nMember States shall notify the Commission immediately of any national general export authorisations issued or modified. The Commission shall publish such notifications in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\n7.   The competent authority of the Member State where the exporter is resident or established may prohibit the exporter from using Union general export authorisations if there is reasonable suspicion about the exporter’s ability to comply with such authorisation or with a provision of the export control legislation.\nThe competent authorities of the Member States shall exchange information on exporters which are prohibited from using a Union general export authorisation, unless the competent authority of the Member State where the exporter is resident or established determines that the exporter will not attempt to export dual-use items through another Member State. The exchange of information shall be carried out using the electronic system referred to in Article 23(6).\nArticle 13\n1.   Authorisations for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance under this Regulation shall be granted by the competent authority of the Member State where the broker or the provider of technical assistance is resident or established. Where the broker or the provider of technical assistance is not resident or established on the customs territory of the Union, authorisations for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance under this Regulation shall be granted by the competent authority of the Member State from where the brokering services or technical assistance will be provided.\n2.   Authorisations for the provision of brokering services shall be granted for a set quantity of specific items and shall clearly identify the location of the items in the originating third country, the end-user and the exact location of the end-user.\nAuthorisations for technical assistance shall clearly identify the end-user and the exact location of the end-user.\nThe authorisations shall be valid throughout the customs territory of the Union.\n3.   Brokers and providers of technical assistance shall supply the competent authority with all relevant information required for their application for authorisation under this Regulation, in particular details of the location of the dual-use items, a clear description of the items and the quantity involved, third parties involved in the transaction, the country of destination, the end-user in that country and its exact location.\n4.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall process requests for authorisations for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance within a period of time to be determined by national law or practice.\n5.   All authorisations for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance shall be issued, whenever possible, by electronic means on forms containing at least all the elements of and in the order provided for in the models set out in Section B of Annex III.\nArticle 14\n1.   If the dual-use items in respect of which an application has been made for an individual export authorisation to a destination not listed in Part 2 of Section A of Annex II or to any destination in the case of dual-use items listed in Annex IV are or will be located in one or more Member States other than the one where the application has been made, that fact shall be indicated in the application. The competent authority of the Member State to which the application for authorisation has been made shall immediately consult the competent authorities of the Member States in question and provide the relevant information. That consultation may be carried out using the electronic system referred to in Article 23(6). The Member States consulted shall make known within 10 working days any objections they may have to the granting of such an authorisation, which shall bind the Member State in which the application has been made.\nIf no objections are received within 10 working days, the Member States consulted shall be regarded as having no objection.\nIn exceptional cases, any Member State consulted may request the extension of that 10-day period. However, the extension shall not exceed 30 working days.\n2.   If an export might prejudice its essential security interests, a Member State may request another Member State not to grant an export authorisation or, if such authorisation has been granted, request its annulment, suspension, modification or revocation. The Member State receiving such a request shall immediately engage in consultations of a non-binding nature with the requesting Member State, to be terminated within 10 working days. In the event that the Member State receiving the request decides to grant the authorisation, that Member State shall notify the Commission and the other Member States thereof using the electronic system referred to in Article 23(6).\nArticle 15\n1.   In deciding whether or not to grant an authorisation or to prohibit a transit under this Regulation, the Member States shall take into account all relevant considerations, including:\n(a)\nUnion and Member States’ international obligations and commitments, in particular the obligations and commitments they have each accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties;\n(b)\ntheir obligations under sanctions imposed by a decision or a common position adopted by the Council or by a decision of the OSCE or by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations;\n(c)\nconsiderations of national foreign and security policy, including those covered by Common Position 2008/944/CFSP;\n(d)\nconsiderations about intended end-use and the risk of diversion.\n2.   In addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 1, when assessing an application for a global export authorisation, Member States shall take into consideration the implementation of an ICP by the exporter.\nArticle 16\n1.   The competent authority acting in accordance with this Regulation, may refuse to grant an export authorisation and may annul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authorisation which it has already granted. Where the competent authority refuses, annuls, suspends, substantially limits or revokes an export authorisation or when it has determined that the intended export is not to be authorised, it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission thereof and share the relevant information with them. In case the competent authority of a Member State has suspended an export authorisation, the final assessment shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission at the end of the period of suspension.\n2.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall review denials of authorisations notified under paragraph 1 within three years of their notification and revoke them, amend them or renew them. The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the results of the review to the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission as soon as possible. Denials which are not revoked shall remain valid and shall be reviewed every three years. At the third review, the Member State concerned shall be required to explain the reasoning for maintaining such denial.\n3.   The competent authority shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission of their decisions to prohibit a transit of dual-use items taken under Article 7 without delay. These notifications shall contain all relevant information including the classification of the item, its technical parameters, the country of destination and the end-user.\n4.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall also apply to authorisations for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance referred to in Article 13.\n5.   Before the competent authority of a Member State decides whether or not to grant an authorisation or to prohibit a transit under this Regulation, it shall examine all valid denials or decisions to prohibit a transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I taken under this Regulation to ascertain whether an authorisation or a transit has been denied by the competent authorities of another Member State for an essentially identical transaction. It shall then consult the competent authorities of the Member States which issued such denials or decisions to prohibit the transit as provided for in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Article.\nThe competent authorities of the Member States consulted shall make known within 10 working days whether or not they consider the transaction in question to be an essentially identical transaction. If no reaction has been received within 10 working days, the competent authorities of the Member States consulted shall be regarded as not considering the transaction in question to be an essentially identical transaction.\nIf more information is required to correctly evaluate the transaction in question, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall agree on the extension of that 10-day period. However, the extension shall not exceed 30 working days.\nIf, following such consultation, the competent authority decides to grant an authorisation or allow the transit, it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission, providing all relevant information to explain the decision.\n6.   All notifications required pursuant to this Article shall be made via secure electronic means, including through the system referred to in Article 23(6).\n7.   All information shared pursuant to this Article shall be in compliance with Article 23(5) concerning the confidentiality of such information.\nCHAPTER IV\nAMENDMENT OF LISTS OF DUAL-USE ITEMS AND DESTINATIONS\nArticle 17\n1.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 in order to amend the list of dual-use items set out in Annexes I and IV, as follows:\n(a)\nthe list of dual-use items set out in Annex I shall be amended in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any amendment thereof, that Member States and, where applicable, the Union have accepted as members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties;\n(b)\nwhere the amendment of Annex I concerns dual-use items which are also listed in Annex II or IV, those Annexes shall be amended accordingly.\n2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 in order to amend Annex II by removing items and by adding or removing destinations from the scope of Union general export authorisations in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group set up pursuant to Article 24 and taking into consideration obligations and commitments under the relevant non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, such as amendments to control lists, as well as relevant geopolitical developments. Where imperative grounds of urgency require a removal of particular destinations from the scope of a Union general export authorisation, the procedure provided for in Article 19 shall apply to delegated acts adopted pursuant to this paragraph.\nArticle 18\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.   The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 17 shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 9 September 2021. The Commission shall draw up a report in respect of the delegation of power not later than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than three months before the end of each period.\n3.   The delegation of power referred to in Article 17 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\n4.   Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall consult experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making.\n5.   As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n6.   A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 17 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or by the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\nArticle 19\n1.   Delegated acts adopted under this Article shall enter into force without delay and shall apply as long as no objection is expressed in accordance with paragraph 2. The notification of a delegated act to the European Parliament and to the Council shall state the reasons for the use of the urgency procedure.\n2.   Either the European Parliament or the Council may object to a delegated act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(6). In such a case, the Commission shall repeal the act immediately following the notification of the decision to object by the European Parliament or by the Council.\nArticle 20\nThe list of dual-use items set out in Annex IV, which is a subset of Annex I, shall be updated having regard to Article 36 TFEU, namely the public policy and public security interests of the Member States.\nCHAPTER V\nCUSTOMS PROCEDURES\nArticle 21\n1.   When completing the formalities for the export of dual-use items at the customs office responsible for handling the export declaration, the exporter shall furnish proof that any necessary export authorisation has been obtained.\n2.   A translation of any documents furnished as proof into an official language of the Member State where the export declaration is presented may be required of the exporter.\n3.   Without prejudice to any powers conferred on it under, and pursuant to, the Union Customs Code, a Member State may also, for a period not exceeding the periods referred to in paragraph 4, suspend the process of export from its territory, or, if necessary, otherwise prevent the dual-use items which are or are not covered by a valid export authorisation from leaving the Union via its territory, where it has:\n(a)\ngrounds for suspicion that:\n(i)\nrelevant information was not taken into account when the authorisation was granted; or\n(ii)\ncircumstances have materially changed since the grant of the authorisation; or\n(b)\nrelevant information regarding the potential application of measures under Article 4(1).\n4.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the Member State referred to in that paragraph shall consult the competent authority of the Member State which granted the export authorisation or which may take action pursuant to Article 4(1) without delay in order that the competent authority may take action pursuant to Article 4(1) or Article 16(1). If that competent authority decides to maintain the authorisation or not to take action pursuant to Article 4(1), it shall reply within 10 working days, which, at its request, may be extended to 30 working days in exceptional circumstances. In such case, or if no reply is received within 10 or 30 working days, as the case may be, the dual-use items shall be released immediately. The competent authority of the Member State which granted the authorisation shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission.\n5.   The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, may develop guidance to support interagency cooperation between licensing and customs authorities.\nArticle 22\n1.   Member States may provide that customs formalities for the export of dual-use items may be completed only at customs offices empowered to that end.\n2.   Member States availing themselves of the option set out in paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of the duly empowered customs offices. The Commission shall publish the information in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nCHAPTER VI\nADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT\nArticle 23\n1.   Member States shall inform the Commission without delay of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted in implementation of this Regulation, including:\n(a)\na list of the competent authorities of the Member States empowered to:\n—\ngrant export authorisations for dual-use items,\n—\ngrant authorisations under this Regulation for the provision of brokering services and technical assistance,\n—\nprohibit the transit of non-Union dual-use items under this Regulation;\n(b)\nthe measures referred to in Article 25(1).\nThe Commission shall forward the information to the other Member States and shall publish the information in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2.   Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall take all appropriate measures to establish direct cooperation and exchange of information between the competent authorities with a view to enhance the efficiency of the Union export control regime and to ensure the consistent and effective implementation and enforcement of control throughout the customs territory of the Union. The information exchange may include:\n(a)\nrelevant licensing data, provided for each authorisation issued (e.g. value and types of licence and related destinations, number of users of general authorisations);\n(b)\nadditional information regarding the application of controls, including information on the application of criteria set out in Article 15(1), the number of operators with an ICP and, where available, data on exports of dual-use items carried out in other Member States;\n(c)\ninformation regarding the analysis underlying additions or planned additions to national control lists pursuant to Article 9;\n(d)\ninformation regarding the enforcement of controls, including risk-based audits, details of exporters deprived of the right to use the national or Union general export authorisations, and, where available, number of violations, seizures and application of other penalties;\n(e)\ndata on sensitive end-users, actors involved in suspicious procurement activities, and, where available, routes taken.\n3.   The exchange of licensing data shall take place at least annually in accordance with guidelines to be drawn up by the Dual-Use Coordination Group established pursuant to Article 24 and with due consideration to legal requirements concerning the protection of personal information, commercially sensitive information or protected defence, foreign policy or national security information.\n4.   Member States and the Commission shall regularly examine the implementation of Article 15 based on information submitted pursuant to this Regulation and analyses of such data. All participants of these exchanges shall respect the confidentiality of the discussions.\n5.   Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 (14), and in particular its provisions on the confidentiality of information, shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n6.   A secure and encrypted system shall be developed by the Commission, in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group set up pursuant to Article 24, to support direct cooperation and exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States and, where appropriate, the Commission. The system shall, where feasible, be connected by the Commission to the electronic licensing systems of the competent authorities of the Member States to the extent necessary for the purpose of facilitating this direct cooperation and exchange of information. The European Parliament shall be informed about the system’s budget, development and functioning.\n7.   The processing of personal data shall be in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725.\nArticle 24\n1.   A Dual-Use Coordination Group chaired by a representative of the Commission shall be set up. Each Member State shall appoint a representative to this Group. It shall examine any question concerning the application of this Regulation which may be raised either by the chair or by a representative of a Member State.\n2.   The Dual-Use Coordination Group shall, whenever it considers it to be necessary, consult exporters, brokers, providers of technical assistance and other relevant stakeholders concerned by this Regulation.\n3.   The Dual-Use Coordination Group shall, where appropriate, set up technical expert groups composed of experts from Member States to examine specific issues relating to the implementation of controls, including issues relating to the updating of the Union control lists set out in Annex I. Technical expert groups shall, where appropriate, consult exporters, brokers, providers of technical assistance and other relevant stakeholders concerned by this Regulation.\n4.   The Commission shall support a Union licensing and enforcement capacity-building programme, including by developing, in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group, common training programmes for officials of the Member States.\nArticle 25\n1.   Each Member State shall take appropriate measures to ensure the proper enforcement of this Regulation. In particular, it shall lay down the penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation or of those adopted for its implementation. Those penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n2.   The Dual-Use Coordination Group shall set up an enforcement coordination mechanism to support exchange of information and direct cooperation between competent authorities and enforcement agencies of the Member States (the ‘Enforcement Coordination Mechanism’). Under the Enforcement Coordination Mechanism, the Member States and the Commission shall exchange relevant information, where available, including on the application, nature and effect of the measures, taken under paragraph 1, on enforcement of best practices and unauthorised exports of dual-use items and/or infringements of this Regulation and/or relevant national legislation.\nUnder the Enforcement Coordination Mechanism, the Member States and the Commission shall also exchange information on best practices of national enforcement authorities regarding risk-based audits, the detection and prosecution of unauthorised exports of dual-use items and/or possible other infringements of this Regulation and/or relevant national legislation.\nExchange of information under the Enforcement Coordination Mechanism shall be confidential.\nCHAPTER VII\nTRANSPARENCY, OUTREACH, MONITORING, EVALUATION\nArticle 26\n1.   The Commission and the Council shall, where appropriate, make available guidelines and/or recommendations for best practices for the subjects referred to in this Regulation to ensure the efficiency of the Union export control regime and the consistency of its implementation. The provision of guidelines and/or recommendations for best practices to exporters, brokers and providers of technical assistance shall be the responsibility of the Member States where they are resident or established. In those guidelines and/or recommendations for best practices, the information needs of SMEs in particular shall be taken into account.\n2.   The Commission shall, in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group, submit an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this Regulation, and on the activities, examinations and consultations of the Dual-Use Coordination Group. That annual report shall be public.\nThe annual report shall include information on authorisations (in particular number and value by types of items and by destinations at Union and Member State levels), denials and prohibitions under this Regulation. The annual report shall also include information on the administration (in particular staffing, compliance and outreach activities, dedicated licensing or classification tools), and enforcement of controls (in particular the number of infringements and penalties).\nWith regard to cyber-surveillance items, the annual report shall include dedicated information on authorisations, in particular on the number of applications received by item, the issuing Member State and the destinations concerned by those applications, and on the decisions taken on those applications.\nThe information contained in the annual report shall be presented in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 3.\nThe Commission and the Council shall make available guidelines on the methodology for data gathering and processing for the preparation of the annual report, including the determination of the types of items and the availability of enforcement data.\n3.   Member States shall provide to the Commission all appropriate information for the preparation of the report with due consideration given to legal requirements concerning the protection of personal information, commercially sensitive information or protected defence, foreign policy or national security information.

Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or \"laser\" irradiation.\nN.B.1\nCVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.\nN.B.2\nPack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.\nN.B.3\nThe gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.\nb.\nThermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates.\nThe addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesise compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process.\nThe use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes.\nSpecific TE-PVD processes are as follows:\n1.\nElectron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;\n2.\nIon Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;\n3.\n\"Laser\" Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave \"laser\" beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;\n4.\nCathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionised plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;\nN.B.\nThis definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.\n5.\nIon Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionise the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.\nc.\nPack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:\n1.\nThe metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);\n2.\nAn activator (normally a halide salt); and\n3.\nAn inert powder, most frequently alumina.\nThe substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1 030 K (757°C) and 1 375 K (1 102°C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating.\nd.\nPlasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.\nN.B.1\nLow pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.\nN.B.2\nHigh velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20°C) at 0,1 MPa.\ne.\nSlurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.\nf.\nSputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.\nN.B.1\nThe Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials.\nN.B.2\nLow-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.\ng.\nIon Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionised, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.\nPART V –\n   \nCategory 3\nCATEGORY 3 - ELECTRONICS\n3A   Systems, Equipment and Components\nNote 1:\nThe control status of equipment and components described in 3A001 or 3A002, other than those described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.10., or 3A001.a.12. to 3A001.a.14., which are specially designed for or which have the same functional characteristics as other equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.\nNote 2:\nThe control status of integrated circuits described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.9., or 3A001.a.12. to 3A001.a.14., which are unalterably programmed or designed for a specific function for another equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.\nN.B.\nWhen the manufacturer or applicant cannot determine the control status of the other equipment, the control status of the integrated circuits is determined in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.9., and 3A001.a.12. to 3A001.a.14.\nNote 3:\nThe status of wafers (finished or unfinished), in which the function has been determined, is to be evaluated against the parameters of 3A001.a., 3A001.b., 3A001.d., 3A001.e.4., 3A001.g., 3A001.h., or 3A001.i.\n3A001\nElectronic items as follows:\na.\nGeneral purpose integrated circuits, as follows:\nNote:\nIntegrated circuits include the following types:\n—\n\"Monolithic integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Hybrid integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Multichip integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Film type integrated circuits\", including silicon-on-sapphire integrated circuits;\n—\n\"Optical integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Three dimensional integrated circuits\";\n—\n\"Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits\" (\"MMICs\").\n1.\nIntegrated circuits designed or rated as radiation hardened to withstand any of the following:\na.\nA total dose of 5 x 103 Gy (silicon) or higher;\nb.\nA dose rate upset of 5 x 106 Gy (silicon)/s or higher; or\nc.\nA fluence (integrated flux) of neutrons (1 MeV equivalent) of 5 x 1013 n/cm2 or higher on silicon, or its equivalent for other materials;\nNote:\n3A001.a.1.c. does not control Metal Insulator Semiconductors (MIS).\n2.\n\"Microprocessor microcircuits\", \"microcomputer microcircuits\", microcontroller microcircuits, storage integrated circuits manufactured from a compound semiconductor, analogue-to-digital converters, integrated circuits that contain analogue-to-digital converters and store or process the digitised data, digital-to-analogue converters, electro-optical or \"optical integrated circuits\" designed for \"signal processing\", field programmable logic devices, custom integrated circuits for which either the function is unknown or the control status of the equipment in which the integrated circuit will be used is unknown, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processors, Static Random-Access Memories (SRAMs), or 'non-volatile memories', having any of the following:\na.\nRated for operation at an ambient temperature above 398 K (125°C);\nb.\nRated for operation at an ambient temperature below 218 K (-55°C); or\nc.\nRated for operation over the entire ambient temperature range from 218 K (-55°C) to 398 K (125°C);\nNote:\n3A001.a.2. does not control integrated circuits designed for civil automobiles or railway train applications.\nTechnical Note:\n'Non-volatile memories' are memories with data retention over a period of time after a power shutdown.\n3.\n\"Microprocessor microcircuits\", \"microcomputer microcircuits\" and microcontroller microcircuits, manufactured from a compound semiconductor and operating at a clock frequency exceeding 40 MHz;\nNote:\n3A001.a.3. includes digital signal processors, digital array processors and digital coprocessors.\n4.\nNot used;\n5.\nAnalogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC) integrated circuits, as follows:\na.\nADCs having any of the following:\nN.B.\nSEE ALSO 3A101\n1.\nA resolution of 8 bit or more, but less than 10 bit, with a \"sample rate\" greater than 1,3 Giga Samples Per Second (GSPS);\n2.\nA resolution of 10 bit or more, but less than 12 bit, with a \"sample rate\" greater than 600 Mega Samples Per Second (MSPS);\n3.\nA resolution of 12 bit or more, but less than 14 bit, with a \"sample rate\" greater than 400 MSPS;\n4.\nA resolution of 14 bit or more, but less than 16 bit, with a \"sample rate\" greater than 250 MSPS; or\n5.\nA resolution of 16 bit or more with a \"sample rate\" greater than 65 MSPS;\nN.B.\nFor integrated circuits that contain analogue-to-digital converters and store or process the digitised data, see 3A001.a.14.\nTechnical Notes:\n1.\nA resolution of n bit corresponds to a quantisation of 2n levels.\n2.\nThe resolution of the ADC is the number of bits of the digital output that represents the measured analogue input.

control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt sets out rules throughout the European Union (EU) to control exports, brokering*, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items*.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nAnnex I to the regulation, based on internationally agreed controls, lists the dual-use items that require export authorisation. The list of dual-use items is amended periodically, and the last amendment was made by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1 of 20 October 2021.\nThese include:\nnuclear materials, facilities and equipment\nspecial materials and related equipment\nmaterials processing\nelectronics\ncomputers\ntelecommunications and information security\nsensors and lasers\nnavigation and avionics\nmarine systems, equipment and materials\naerospace and propulsion systems and equipment.\nOther dual-use items, including any associated brokering services or technical assistance, need export authorisation if they are intended, entirely or in part, for:\nchemical, biological or nuclear weapons;\nmilitary use in countries subject to an arms embargo;\ncomponents of military items already exported from an EU Member State without the necessary authorisation.\nAuthorisation is required for:\nthe export of cybersurveillance items likely to be used for internal repression or serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law;\nthe transfer of dual-use items listed in Annex IV, such as stealth technology and strategic control, from one Member State to another.\nMember States may:\nprohibit the transit on their territory of non-EU dual-use items if their intended use would breach the regulation;\nban or demand an export authorisation for items not listed in Annex I, for reasons of public security, including terrorism or human rights violations;\ndemand export authorisation, in certain circumstances, for the transfer of dual-use items from their territory to another Member State.\nThe regulation provides for five types of authorisation valid throughout the EU customs area.\nEU general export authorisations. These are for certain destinations under certain conditions. They include authorisation for exports to Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nNational general export authorisations. These are issued by Member States if they are consistent with existing EU general export authorisations and they do not cover the export of dual-use software and technology to certain countries (Annex II G).\nIndividual and global. These are issued by national authorities for up to 2 years to one exporter for the export of: one or more dual-use items to one end-user in a non-EU country (individual); ormultiple items, countries and end-users (global).\nLarge project authorisations. Individual export authorisation or a global export authorisation granted to one specific exporter, in respect of a type or category of dual-use items which may be valid for exports to one or more specified end-users in one or more specified non-EU countries for the purpose of a specified large-scale project.\nExporters* requesting authorisation must:\nsupply authorities with complete information, especially on the end-user,country of destination,end-use of the item exported;\nkeep detailed records of their exports for 5 years, including commercial documents such as invoices and transport material, to identify: the descriptions and quantities of the dual-use items,the names and addresses of the exporter and consignee,the end-use and end-user, when known.\nAuthorisations to provide brokering services and technical assistance are granted by national authorities and are valid throughout the EU customs area. They require details of:\nthe location, description and quantity of the dual-use items;\nthe third parties involved;\nthe country of destination;\nthe end-user and location.\nMember States, when deciding to grant or refuse an authorisation request, must take into account:\nthe EU, national and international obligations and commitments, particularly relevant non-proliferation regimes and export controls;\nany EU, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe or United Nations sanctions;\nthe national foreign and security policy decisions;\nthe intended end-use and risk of diversion.\nMember States must:\ninform the European Commission of: the national authorities authorised to grant export authorisations and prohibit transit of non-EU dual-use items,the measures they take to enforce the regulation;\ntake every measure, in conjunction with the Commission, to establish direct cooperation and information exchange between national authorities to ensure the efficiency, consistency and enforcement of the export controls;\nprovide the Commission with the necessary information for its annual report.\nThe Commission has the following responsibilities.\nIt develops a secure and encrypted system to support cooperation and the exchange of information between national authorities and, where appropriate, the Commission itself.\nTogether with the Council, it issues guidelines and best-practice recommendations to ensure the system’s efficiency and consistency.\nIt submits an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the regulation, in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group. This includes the number, value and destination of authorisations and requests refused.\nIt uses a simplified procedure (delegated acts) to amend the list of items and destinations subject to specific controls.\nIt will carry out an initial evaluation of cybersurveillance authorisations after 10 September 2024, and a full evaluation of the regulation between 10 September 2026 and 10 September 2028. It will submit both evaluations to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee.\nThe regulation establishes a Dual-Use Coordination Group chaired by the Commission with a representative from each Member State. This group:\nexamines issues arising from the legislation;\ncan consult exporters, brokers, technical assistance providers and other individuals and bodies involved;\nsets up groups of technical experts.\nThe Commission and Member States use exchanges of information and best practice, capacity building and outreach with non-EU countries to promote global convergence on dual-use export controls.\nRepeal\nThe regulation repeals and revises Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 (see summary) from 9 September 2021, except for authorisation applications made before this date, as stated in Article 31 of Regulation (EU) 2021/821.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 9 September 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nDual-use goods and technology meet many civilian needs, but they can also be used for defence, intelligence and law enforcement.\nRegulation (EU) 2021/821 provides a comprehensive system upgrade to strengthen the previous export control system and respond to evolving security risks and emerging technologies.\nIt expands cooperation between Member States and the Commission, places specific obligations on exporters and introduces controls to prevent cybersurveillance technologies from violating human rights.\nThe EU system is aligned with international rules and commitments made by the following:\nAustralia Group\nMissile Technology Control Regime\nNuclear Suppliers Group\nWassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies\nChemical Weapons Convention.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nBrokering.
