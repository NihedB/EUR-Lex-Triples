The Convention provides for a framework for the control and limitation of the use, and of anthropogenic emissions and releases, of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land, with a view to protecting human health and the environment.\n(3)\nMercury is a substance characterised by its transboundary nature. Global action is therefore necessary to ensure the protection of individuals and of the environment within the Union as a complement to domestic measures.\n(4)\nThe Seventh Environmental Action programme (3) establishes the long-term objective of a non-toxic environment and states that, for that purpose, action is needed to ensure the minimisation of significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020.\n(5)\nThe 2005 Community Strategy Concerning Mercury, as reviewed in 2010, seeks to reduce mercury emissions, cut the supply and demand of mercury, protect against exposure to mercury, and promote international action on mercury.\n(6)\nThe Council reaffirms its commitment, as expressed in its Conclusions of 14 March 2011, to the overall objective of protecting human health and the environment from releases of mercury and its compounds by minimising and, where feasible, ultimately eliminating global anthropogenic mercury releases to air, water and land. The Convention contributes to the achievement of those objectives.\n(7)\nIn accordance with Article 30(3) of the Convention, the Union should, in its instrument of approval, declare the extent of its competence in respect of the matters governed by the Convention.\n(8)\nThe Convention should be approved,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe Minamata Convention on Mercury is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union.\nThe Declaration of Competence required by Article 30(3) of the Convention is hereby also approved.\nThe text of the Convention and the Declaration of Competence are attached to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the Union, the instrument of approval provided for in Article 30(1) of the Convention, together with the Declaration of Competence.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels, 11 May 2017.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nR.

The convention is included in the annex to the decision.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe Minamata Convention on Mercury — concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme — sets up an international set of rules for cooperation and measures to limit the use of mercury and mercury compounds. It further aims to control and reduce anthropogenic emissions (i.e. relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings) of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land.\nThe convention covers the complete life-cycle of mercury. It contains articles that introduce:\na ban on new mercury mines and a phase-out of existing ones;\nrestrictions on international trade in mercury;\ncontrol measures on emissions and releases;\nmeasures to prohibit the manufacture, import or export of a range of mercury-added products;\nmeasures to phase-out and phase-down the use of mercury in key manufacturing processes;\nmeasures to phase down the use of dental amalgam;\nmeasures to reduce mercury emissions from artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing;\nmeasures to ensure the environmental sound interim storage of mercury and mercury compounds and the environmental sound management of mercury waste.\nThe EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/852 to enable EU countries to implement the convention.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 11 May 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nMercury is recognised as a substance producing significant adverse neurological and other health effects, with particular concerns expressed about its harmful effects on unborn children and infants. The global transport of mercury in the environment was a key reason for taking the decision that global action to address the problem of mercury pollution was required.\nThe EU signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury in October 2013 and thereby committed itself to ensuring its ratification and implementation.\nFor more information, see:\nMinamata Convention on Mercury (European Commission)\nMinamata Convention on Mercury (United Nations).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision (EU) 2017/939 of 11 May 2017 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Minamata Convention on Mercury (OJ L 142, 2.6.2017, pp. 4-39)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision (EU) 2017/938 of 23 September 2013 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Minamata Convention on Mercury (OJ L 142, 2.6.2017, pp. 2-3)\nRegulation (EU) 2017/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 on mercury, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1102/2008 (OJ L 137, 24.5.2017, pp. 1-21)\nlast update 05.06.2018", "tags": ["mercury", "prevention of pollution", "environmental protection", "ratification of an agreement", "metal pollution", "international convention", "public health"], "subjects": ["Environment", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32017D0939_p1": {"text": "regulation 2017/852 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 May 2017 on mercury, and repealing regulation 1102/2008 (1),", "triples": [" regulation 2017/852,  repealing,  regulation 1102/2008"]}, "32017D0939_p2": {"text": "directive 2006/66/ec of the European Parliament and the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing directive 91/157/eec (OJ L 266, 26.9.2006, p. 1),", "triples": [" directive 2006/66/ec,  repealing,  directive 91/157/eec"]}, "32017D0939_p3": {"text": "regulation 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending directive 1999/45/ec and repealing Council regulation 793/93 and Commission regulation 1488/94 as well as Council directive 76/769/eec and Commission directive 91/155/eec directive 93/67/eec directive 93/105/ec directive 2000/21/ec (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1),", "triples": [" regulation 1907/2006,  amending,  directive 1999/45/ec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  regulation 793/93", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  regulation 1488/94", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 91/155/eec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 93/67/eec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 93/105/ec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 2000/21/ec"]}, "32017D0939_p4": {"text": "regulation 1107/2009 of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council directive 79/117/eec directive 91/414/eec (OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1),", "triples": [" regulation 1107/2009,  repealing,  directive 79/117/eec", " regulation 1107/2009,  repealing,  directive 91/414/eec"]}, "32017D0939_p5": {"text": "directive 2012/18/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, amending and subsequently repealing Council directive 96/82/ec (OJ L 197, 24.7.2012, p. 1),", "triples": [" directive 2012/18/eu,  amending,  directive 96/82/ec", " directive 2012/18/eu,  repealing,  directive 96/82/ec"]}, "32017D0939_p6": {"text": "regulation 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register and amending Council directive 91/689/eec directive 96/61/ec (OJ L 33, 4.2.2006, p. 1),", "triples": [" regulation 166/2006,  amending,  directive 91/689/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
