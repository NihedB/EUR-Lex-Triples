In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nAchieving freedom to provide services in the field of transport is an important element of the common transport policy under the Treaty. Consequently, it is the aim of that policy to increase the fluidity of movement of the different means of transport within the Community.\n(3)\nPursuant to existing Community and national legislation in the field of road and inland waterway transport, Member States perform checks, verifications and inspections relating to technical characteristics, authorisations and other documentation that vehicles and inland waterway vessels must comply with. These checks, verifications and inspections continue in general to be justified in order to avoid disturbances to the organisation of the transport market and to ensure road and inland waterway safety.\n(4)\nUnder existing Community legislation, Member States are free to organise and perform the aforementioned checks, verifications and inspections where they so wish.\n(5)\nSuch checks, verifications and inspections may be performed with equal efficacy throughout the territory of the Member States concerned and crossing the frontier should not therefore be a pretext for carrying out such operations,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation applies to controls performed by Member States pursuant to Community or national law in the fields of road and inland waterway transport carried out using means of transport registered or put into circulation in a Member State.\nArticle 2\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:\n(a)\n‘frontier’ means either an internal frontier within the Community or an external frontier, where carriage between Member States involves crossing a third country;\n(b)\n‘control’ means any check, inspection, verification or formality performed at the frontiers of Member States by the national authorities which signifies a stop or a restriction on the free movement of the vehicles or vessels concerned.\nArticle 3\nThe controls referred to in Annex I, and performed pursuant to Community or national law in the fields of road and inland waterway transport between Member States, shall not be performed as frontier controls but solely as part of the normal control procedures applied in a non-discriminatory fashion throughout the territory of a Member State.\nArticle 4\nAs and when necessary, the Commission shall propose amendments to Annex I to take account of technological developments in the field covered by this Regulation.\nArticle 5\nRegulation (EEC) No 4060/89, as amended by the Regulation listed in Annex II, is repealed.\nReferences to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.\nArticle 6\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 22 October 2008.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

border controls\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EEC) No 3912/92 on controls carried out within the EU in the field of road and inland waterway transport in respect of means of transport registered or put into circulation in a non-EU country\nRegulation (EC) No 1100/2008 on eliminating controls performed at the EU countries’ frontiers in the field of road and inland waterway transport\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?\n              \nThe regulations abolish controls performed by EU countries of compliance with rules in the fields of road and inland waterway transport at the internal borders of the EU. To ensure the free movement within the EU of the vehicles and vessels concerned, these controls are no longer to be performed as border controls but solely as part of the normal control procedures applied in a non-discriminatory fashion throughout the territory of the EU countries.\nKEY POINTS\nRegulation (EEC) No 3912/92 refers to controls related to road and inland waterway transport operations that are carried out by means of transport registered or put into circulation in a country that is not an EU country. These controls are no longer to be performed at the internal borders between EU countries but solely as part of the normal control procedures applied in a non-discriminatory fashion throughout the territory of these countries. They may, however, still be carried out at the external borders (with a non-EU country).\nRegulation (EC) No 1100/2008 refers to controls related to road and inland waterway transport operations that are carried out by means of transport registered or put into circulation in an EU country. These controls are no longer to be performed at the internal borders between the EU countries but solely as part of the normal control procedures applied in a non-discriminatory fashion throughout the territory of these countries.\nThe controls covered by the two regulations are those pursuant to EU or national law referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1100/2008 and, in the case of Regulation (EEC) No 3912/92, those pursuant to international agreements between one or more EU countries and one or more non-EU countries as well.\nUnited Kingdom withdrawal from the EU\nSince the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU on 31 January 2020, the border between the United Kingdom and the EU countries is no longer an internal border. However, during the transition period, while EU laws have still applied to and within the United Kingdom, this border was treated like an internal border. From the beginning of 2021, both the abovementioned regulations no longer apply to that border. The control of UK vehicles and vessels will henceforth be subject to Regulation (EEC) No 3912/92 and will no longer be subject to Regulation (EC) No 1100/2008.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\nRegulation (EEC) No 3912/92 has applied since 1 January 1993.\nRegulation (EC) No 1100/2008 has applied since 4 December 2008. It codified and replaced Regulation (EEC) No 4060/89 and its subsequent amendments. which applied from 1 July 1990).\nBACKGROUND\n              \nSee also:\nInland waterways (European Commission)\nRoad (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 3912/92 of 17 December 1992 on controls carried out within the Community in the field of road and inland waterway transport in respect of means of transport registered or put into circulation in a third country (OJ L 395, 31.12.1992, pp. 6-7)\nRegulation (EC) No 1100/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 on the elimination of controls performed at the frontiers of Member States in the field of road and inland waterway transport (Codified version) (OJ L 304, 14.11.2008, pp. 63-69)\nlast update 27.11.2020", "tags": ["customs regulations", "customs inspection", "inland waterway transport", "road transport", "internal border of the EU", "codification of EU law"], "subjects": ["Transport", "Harmonisation of customs law: various"], "split": "validation", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32008R1100_p1": {"text": "regulation 1100/2008 has applied since 4 December 2008.
