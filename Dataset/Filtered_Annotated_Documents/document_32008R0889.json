{"celex_id": "32008R0889", "reference": "18.9.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 250/1\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 889/2008\nof 5 September 2008\nlaying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products with regard to organic production, labelling and control\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (1), and in particular Article 9(4), the second paragraph of Article 11 Articles 12(3), 14(2), 16(3)(c), 17(2) and 18(5), the second subparagraph of Article 19(3), Articles 21(2), 22(1), 24(3), 25(3), 26, 28(6), 29(3) and 38(a), (b), (c) and (e), and Article 40 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 834/2007, and in particular Titles III, IV and V thereof, lay down basic requirements with regard to production, labelling and control of organic products in the plant and livestock sector. Detailed rules for the implementation of those requirements should be laid down.\n(2)\nThe evolution of new detailed production rules on certain animal species, organic aquaculture, seaweed and yeasts used as food or feed on community level will require more time and therefore should be elaborated in a subsequent procedure. It is therefore appropriate to exclude those products from the scope of this Regulation. However, as regards certain livestock species, aquaculture products and seaweed, the Community rules provided for production, controls and labelling should apply mutatis mutandis to those products, in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.\n(3)\nCertain definitions should be laid down in order to avoid ambiguities and to guarantee the uniform application of the organic production rules.\n(4)\nOrganic plant production is based on nourishing the plants primarily through the soil ecosystem. Therefore hydroponic cultivation, where plants grow with their roots in an inert medium feed with soluble minerals and nutrients, should not be allowed.\n(5)\nOrganic plant production involves varied cultivation practices and limited use of fertilisers and conditioners of low solubility, therefore these practices should be specified. In particular, conditions for the use of certain non-synthetic products should be laid down.\n(6)\nThe use of pesticides, which may have detrimental effects on the environment or result in the presence of residues in agricultural products, should be significantly restricted. Preference should be given to the application of preventive measures in pest, disease and weed control. In addition, conditions for the use of certain plant protection products should be laid down.\n(7)\nFor the purpose of organic farming, the use of certain plant protection products, fertilisers, soil conditioners, as well as certain non-organic feed materials, feed additives and feed processing aids and certain products used for cleaning and disinfection was allowed under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (2) under well-defined conditions. For the sake of ensuring the continuity of organic farming the products and substances in question should, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 16(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, continue to be allowed. Moreover, for the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to list in the Annexes to this Regulation the products and substances which had been allowed under Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. Other products and substances may be added to these lists in the future under a different legal basis, namely Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. It is therefore appropriate to identify the distinct status of each category of products and substances by means of a symbol in the list.\n(8)\nThe holistic approach of organic farming requires a livestock production related to the land, where the produced manure is used to nourish the crop production. Since livestock farming always implies the management of agricultural land, provision should be made to prohibit landless livestock production. In organic livestock production the choice of breeds should take account of their capacity to adapt to local conditions, their vitality and their resistance to disease and a wide biological diversity should be encouraged.\n(9)\nUnder certain circumstances operators may face difficulties in obtaining organic breeding animals from a reduced gene pool, which would hamper the development of the sector. Therefore the possibility of bringing a limited number of non-organic animals onto a farm for breeding purposes should be provided for.\n(10)\nOrganic stock farming should ensure that specific behavioural needs of animals are met. In this regard, housing for all species of livestock should satisfy the needs of the animals concerned as regards ventilation, light, space and comfort and sufficient area should accordingly be provided to permit ample freedom of movement for each animal and to develop the animal's natural social behaviour. Specific housing conditions and husbandry practices with regard to certain animals, including bees, should be laid down. These specific housing conditions should serve a high level of animal welfare, which is a priority in organic livestock farming and therefore may go beyond Community welfare standards which apply to farming in general. Organic husbandry practices should prevent poultry from being reared too quickly. Therefore specific provisions to avoid intensive rearing methods should be laid down. In particular poultry shall either be reared until they reach a minimum age or else shall come from slow-growing poultry strains, so that in either case there is no incentive to use intensive rearing methods.\n(11)\nIn most cases, livestock should have permanent access to open air areas for grazing, weather conditions permitting, and such open air areas should in principle be organised under an appropriate system of rotation.\n(12)\nIn order to avoid environmental pollution of natural resources such as soil and water by nutrients, an upper limit for the use of manure per hectare and for keeping livestock per hectare should be set. This limit should be related to the nitrogen content of the manure.\n(13)\nMutilations which lead to stress, harm, disease or the suffering of animals should be banned. However, specific operations essential to certain types of production and for the sake of security for animals and human beings may be permitted under restricted conditions.\n(14)\nLivestock should be fed on grass, fodder and feedingstuffs produced in accordance with the rules of organic farming, preferably coming from the own holding, by taking into account their physiological needs. In addition, in order to provide for the basic nutritional requirements of livestock, certain minerals, trace elements and vitamins may need to be used under well-defined conditions.\n(15)\nSince the existing regional differences in the possibility for organic ruminants to obtain the necessary essential vitamins A, D and E through their feed rations, as regards climate and available sources of feed, are expected to persist, the use of such vitamins for ruminants should be allowed.\n(16)\nAnimal-health management should mainly be based on prevention of disease. In addition specific cleaning and disinfection measures should be applied.\n(17)\nThe preventive use of chemically-synthesised allopathic medicinal products is not permitted in organic farming. However, in the event of a sickness or injury of an animal requiring an immediate treatment, the use of chemically-synthesised allopathic medicinal products should be limited to a strict minimum. Furthermore, in order to guarantee the integrity of organic production for consumers it should be possible to take restrictive measures such as doubling the withdrawal period after use of chemically synthesised allopathic medicinal products.\n(18)\nSpecific rules for disease prevention and veterinary treatment in beekeeping should be laid down.\n(19)\nProvision should be made to require operators producing feed or food to take account of appropriate procedures based on a systematic identification of critical processing steps in order to ensure that the produced processed products comply with the organic production rules.\n(20)\nCertain non-organic products and substances are needed in order to ensure the production of certain processed organic food and feed. The harmonization of wine processing rules on Community level will require more time. Therefore the mentioned products should be excluded for wine processing until, in a subsequent procedure, specific rules are laid down.\n(21)\nFor the purpose of processing organic food, the use of certain ingredients of non-agricultural origin, certain food processing aid and certain non-organic ingredients of agricultural origin was allowed under Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 under well-defined conditions. For the sake of ensuring the continuity of organic farming the products and substances in question should, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 21(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, continue to be allowed. Moreover, for the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to list in the Annexes to this Regulation the products and substances which had been allowed under Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. Other products and substances may be added to these lists in the future under a different legal basis, namely Article 21(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. It is therefore appropriate to identify the distinct status of each category of products and substances by means of a symbol in the list.\n(22)\nUnder certain conditions organic products and non-organic products can be collected and transported simultaneously. In order to duly separate organic from non-organic products during handling and to avoid any commingling specific provisions should be laid down.\n(23)\nThe conversion to the organic production method requires certain periods of adaptation of all means in use. Depending on the previous farm production, specific time periods for the various production sectors should be laid down.\n(24)\nIn accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, specific conditions for the application of exceptions provided for in that Article should be laid down. It is appropriate to set out such conditions with regard to the non availability of organic animals, feed, beeswax, seeds and seed potatoes and organic ingredients as well as to specific problems related to the livestock management and in the case of catastrophic circumstances.\n(25)\nGeographical and structural differences in agriculture and climatic constraints may hamper the development of organic production in certain regions and therefore call for exceptions for certain practices as regards the characteristics of livestock buildings and installations. Therefore tethering of animals should, under well-defined conditions, be allowed in holdings which, due to their geographical location and structural constraints, in particular with regard to mountainous areas, are of small size, and only where it is not possible to keep the cattle in groups appropriate to their behavioural needs.\n(26)\nFor the purpose of ensuring the development of an incipient organic livestock sector, several temporary derogations as regards tethering of animals, housing conditions for animals and stocking densities were granted under Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. These derogations should, on a transitional basis, be maintained until their expiry date, in order not to disrupt the organic livestock sector.\n(27)\nConsidering the importance of pollination of the organic beekeeping sector it should be possible to grant exceptions permitting the parallel production of organic and non-organic beekeeping unit on the same farm.\n(28)\nUnder certain circumstances, farmers may experience difficulty in securing supplies of organically reared livestock and organic feedingstuffs and therefore authorisation should be granted for a limited number of non-organically produced farm input to be used in restricted quantities.\n(29)\nMajor efforts have been undertaken by producers involved in organic production for the development of the production of organic seeds and vegetative materials in order to establish a broad choice of plant varieties of plant species for which organic seeds and vegetative propagating material is available. However, currently for many species there is still not enough organic seed and vegetative propagating material available and, in those cases, the use of non-organic seed and vegetative propagating material should be allowed.\n(30)\nIn order to help operators to find organic seed and seed potatoes, each Member State should ensure that a database is set up that contains the varieties of which organic seed and seed potatoes are available on the market.\n(31)\nThe management of adult bovine animals may endanger the keeper and other persons handling the animals. Therefore provision should be made to allow for exceptions to be granted during the final fattening phase of mammals, in particular with regard to bovine animals.\n(32)\nCatastrophic circumstances or widespread animal or plant diseases may have serious effects on the organic production in the regions concerned. Appropriate measures need to be taken to ensure the maintenance of farming or even the reestablishment of farming. Therefore the supply of non-organic animals, or non-organic feed should be made possible for a limited period in the affected areas.\n(33)\nIn accordance with Articles 24(3) and 25(3) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, specific criteria as regards the presentation, composition, size and design of the Community logo, as well as the presentation and composition of the code number of the control authority or control body and of the indication of the place where the agricultural product has been farmed should be laid down.\n(34)\nIn accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, specific requirements for the labelling of organic feed should be laid down taking into account the varieties and composition of feed and the horizontal labelling provisions applicable to feed.\n(35)\nIn addition to the control system based on the Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (3) specific control measures should be laid down. In particular, detailed requirements with regard to all stages of production, preparation and distribution related to organic products.\n(36)\nNotifications of information by the Member States to the Commission must enable it to use the information sent directly and as effectively as possible for the management of statistical information and referential data. To achieve this objective, all information to be made available or to be communicated between the Member States and the Commission should be sent electronically or in digital form.\n(37)\nExchanges of information and documents between the Commission and the Member States, and the provision and notification of information from the Member States to the Commission are generally carried out electronically or in digital form. In order to improve the way such exchanges of information under organic production rules are dealt with and to extend their use, it is necessary to adapt the existing computer systems or set up new ones. Provision should be made for this to be done by the Commission and implemented after informing the Member States via the Committee on organic production.\n(38)\nThe conditions under which information is processed by these computer systems and the form and content of documents which have to be communicated under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 have to be adjusted frequently in line with changes to the applicable rules or management requirements. Uniform presentation of the documents to be sent in by the Member States is also necessary. To achieve these objectives and to simplify procedures and ensure that the computer systems concerned can be made operational immediately, the form and content of the documents should be laid down on the basis of models or questionnaires, which should be adapted and updated by the Commission after informing the Committee on organic production.\n(39)\nTransitional measures should be laid down, for certain provisions established under Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, in order not to jeopardize the continuity of the organic production.\n(40)\nCommission Regulation (EEC) No 207/93 of 29 January 1993 defining the content of Annex VI to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs and laying down detailed rules for implementing the provisions of Article 5(4) thereto (4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1452/2003 of 14 August 2003 maintaining the derogation provided for in Article 6(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 with regard to certain species of seed and vegetative propagating material and laying down procedural rules and criteria relating to that derogation (5) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 223/2003 of 5 February 2003 on labelling requirements related to the organic production method for feedingstuffs, compound feedingstuffs and feed materials and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (6) should be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(41)\nRegulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is repealed by Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 with effect from 1 January 2009. However, many of its provisions should, with some adaptation, continue to apply and should therefore be adopted in the framework of this Regulation. For the sake of clarity it is appropriate to set out the correlation between those provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and the provisions of this Regulation.\n(42)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nContent\nTitle I\nIntroductory provisions\nTitle II\nRules on production, processing, packaging, transport and storage of products\nChapter 1\nPlant production\nChapter 2\nLivestock production\nSection 1\nOrigin of animals\nSection 2\nLivestock housing and husbandry practices\nSection 3\nFeed\nSection 4\nDisease prevention and veterinary treatment\nChapter 3\nProcessed products\nChapter 4\nCollection, packaging, transport, storage of products\nChapter 5\nConversion rules\nChapter 6\nExceptional production rules\nSection 1\nClimatic, geographical or structural constraints\nSection 2\nNon-availability of organic farm input\nSection 3\nSpecific management problems in organic livestock\nSection 4\nCatastrophic circumstances\nChapter 7\nSeed data base\nTitle III\nLabelling\nChapter 1\nCommunity logo\nChapter 2\nSpecific labelling requirements for feed\nChapter 3\nOther specific labelling requirements\nTitle IV\nControls\nChapter 1\nMinimum control requirements\nChapter 2\nControl requirements for plants and plant products\nChapter 3\nControl requirements for livestock and livestock products\nChapter 4\nControl requirements for preparation of products\nChapter 5\nControl requirements for imports\nChapter 6\nControl requirements for units using contracts to third parties\nChapter 7\nControl requirements for units preparing feed\nChapter 8\nInfringements and exchange of information\nTitle V\nTransmission of information to the Commission, transitional and final provisions\nChapter 1\nTransmission of information to the Commission\nChapter 2\nTransitional and final provisions\nTITLE I\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

Where the nutritional needs of plants cannot be met by measures provided for in Article 12(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, only fertilisers and soil conditioners referred to in Annex I to this Regulation may be used in organic production and only to the extent necessary. Operators shall keep documentary evidence of the need to use the product.\n2.   The total amount of livestock manure, as defined in Council Directive 91/676/EEC (8) concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources, applied on the holding may not exceed 170 kg of nitrogen per year/hectare of agricultural area used. This limit shall only apply to the use of farmyard manure, dried farmyard manure and dehydrated poultry manure, composted animal excrements, including poultry manure, composted farmyard manure and liquid animal excrements.\n3.   Organic-production holdings may establish written cooperation agreements exclusively with other holdings and enterprises which comply with the organic production rules, with the intention of spreading surplus manure from organic production. The maximum limit as referred to in paragraph 2, shall be calculated on the basis of all of the organic-production units involved in such cooperation.\n4.   Appropriate preparations of micro-organisms may be used to improve the overall condition of the soil or the availability of nutrients in the soil or in the crops.\n5.   For compost activation appropriate plant-based preparations or preparations of micro-organisms may be used.\nArticle 4\nProhibition of hydroponic production\nHydroponic production is prohibited.\nArticle 5\nPest, disease and weed management\n1.   Where plants cannot be adequately protected from pests and diseases by measures provided for in Article 12 (1)(a), (b), (c) and (g) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, only products referred to in Annex II to this Regulation may be used in organic production. Operators shall keep documentary evidence of the need to use the product.\n2.   For products used in traps and dispensers, except pheromone dispensers, the traps and/or dispensers, shall prevent the substances from being released into the environment and prevent contact between the substances and the crops being cultivated. The traps shall be collected after use and disposed off safely.\nArticle 6\nSpecific rules on mushroom production\nFor production of mushrooms, substrates may be used, if they are composed only of the following components:\n(a)\nfarmyard manure and animal excrements:\n(i)\neither from holdings producing according to the organic production method;\n(ii)\nor referred to in Annex I, only when the product referred to in point (i) is not available; and when they do not exceed 25 % of the weight of total components of the substrate, excluding the covering material and any added water, before composting;\n(b)\nproducts of agricultural origin, other than those referred to in point (a), from holdings producing according to organic production method;\n(c)\npeat not chemically treated;\n(d)\nwood, not treated with chemical products after felling;\n(e)\nmineral products referred to in Annex I, water and soil.\nCHAPTER 2\nLivestock production\nArticle 7\nScope\nThis Chapter lays down detailed production rules for the following species: bovine including bubalus and bison, equidae, porcine, ovine, caprine, poultry (species as mentioned in Annex III) and bees.\nSection 1\nOrigin of animals\nArticle 8\nOrigin of organic animals\n1.   In the choice of breeds or strains, account shall be taken of the capacity of animals to adapt to local conditions, their vitality and their resistance to disease. In addition, breeds or strains of animals shall be selected to avoid specific diseases or health problems associated with some breeds or strains used in intensive production, such as porcine stress syndrome, PSE Syndrome (pale-soft-exudative), sudden death, spontaneous abortion and difficult births requiring caesarean operations. Preference is to be given to indigenous breeds and strains.\n2.   For bees, preference shall be given to the use of Apis mellifera and their local ecotypes.\nArticle 9\nOrigin of non-organic animals\n1.   In accordance with Article 14(1)(a)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, non-organic animals may be brought onto a holding for breeding purposes, only when organic animals are not available in sufficient number and subject to the conditions provided for in paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article.\n2.   Non-organic young mammals, when a herd or flock is constituted for the first time, shall be reared in accordance with the organic production rules immediately after they are weaned. Moreover, the following restrictions shall apply at the date on which the animals enter the herd:\n(a)\nbuffalo, calves and foals shall be less than six months old;\n(b)\nlambs and kids shall be less than 60 days old;\n(c)\npiglets shall weigh less than 35 kg.\n3.   Non-organic adult male and nulliparous female mammals, for the renewal of a herd or flock, shall be reared subsequently in accordance with the organic production rules. Moreover, the number of female mammals is subject to the following restrictions per year:\n(a)\nup to a maximum of 10 % of adult equine or bovine, including bubalus and bison species, livestock and 20 % of the adult porcine, ovine and caprine livestock, as female animals;\n(b)\nfor units with less than 10 equine or bovine animals, or with less than five porcine, ovine or caprine animals any renewal as mentioned above shall be limited to a maximum of one animal per year.\nThis provision of this paragraph will be reviewed in 2012 with a view to phase it out.\n4.   The percentages referred to in paragraph 3 may be increased up to 40 %, subject to prior authorisation by the competent authority, in the following special cases:\n(a)\nwhen a major extension to the farm is undertaken;\n(b)\nwhen a breed is changed;\n(c)\nwhen a new livestock specialisation is initiated;\n(d)\nwhen breeds are in danger of being lost to farming as laid down in Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 (9) and in that case animals of those breeds must not necessarily be nulliparous.\n5.   For the renovation of apiaries, 10 % per year of the queen bees and swarms may be replaced by non-organic queen bees and swarms in the organic production unit provided that the queen bees and swarms are placed in hives with combs or comb foundations coming from organic production units.\nSection 2\nLivestock housing and husbandry practices\nArticle 10\nRules pertaining to housing conditions\n1.   Insulation, heating and ventilation of the building shall ensure that air circulation, dust level, temperature, relative air humidity and gas concentration, are kept within limits which are not harmful to the animals. The building shall permit plentiful natural ventilation and light to enter.\n2.   Housing for livestock shall not be mandatory in areas with appropriate climatic conditions to enable animals to live outdoors.\n3.   The stocking density in buildings shall provide for the comfort, the well being and the species-specific needs of the animals which, in particular, shall depend on the species, the breed and the age of the animals. It shall also take account of the behavioural needs of the animals, which depend in particular on the size of the group and the animals' sex. The density shall ensure the animals' welfare by providing them with sufficient space to stand naturally, lie down easily, turn round, groom themselves, assume all natural postures and make all natural movements such as stretching and wing flapping.\n4.   The minimum surface for indoor and outdoor areas, and other characteristics of housing for different species and categories of animals, are laid down in Annex III.\nArticle 11\nSpecific housing conditions and husbandry practices for mammals\n1.   Livestock housing shall have smooth, but not slippery floors. At least half of the indoor surface area as specified in Annex III shall be solid, that is, not of slatted or of grid construction.\n2.   The housing shall be provided with a comfortable, clean and dry laying/rest area of sufficient size, consisting of a solid construction which is not slatted. Ample dry bedding strewn with litter material shall be provided in the rest area. The litter shall comprise straw or other suitable natural material. The litter may be improved and enriched with any mineral product listed in Annex I.\n3.   Notwithstanding Article 3(3) of Council Directive 91/629/EEC (10) the housing of calves in individual boxes shall be forbidden after the age of one week.\n4.   Notwithstanding Article 3(8) of Council Directive 91/630/EEC (11) sows shall be kept in groups, except in the last stages of pregnancy and during the suckling period.\n5.   Piglets shall not be kept on flat decks or in piglet cages.\n6.   Exercise areas shall permit dunging and rooting by porcine animals. For the purposes of rooting different substrates can be used.\nArticle 12\nSpecific housing conditions and husbandry practices for poultry\n1.   Poultry shall not be kept in cages.\n2.   Water fowl shall have access to a stream, pond, lake or a pool whenever the weather and hygienic conditions permit in order to respect their species-specific needs and animal welfare requirements.\n3.   Buildings for all poultry shall meet the following conditions:\n(a)\nat least one third of the floor area shall be solid, that is, not of slatted or of grid construction, and covered with a litter material such as straw, wood shavings, sand or turf;\n(b)\nin poultry houses for laying hens, a sufficiently large part of the floor area available to the hens shall be available for the collection of bird droppings;\n(c)\nthey shall have perches of a size and number commensurate with the size of the group and of the birds as laid down in Annex III.\n(d)\nthey shall have exit/entry pop-holes of a size adequate for the birds, and these pop-holes shall have a combined length of at least 4 m per 100 m2 area of the house available to the birds;\n(e)\neach poultry house shall not contain more than:\n(i)\n4 800 chickens,\n(ii)\n3 000 laying hens,\n(iii)\n5 200 guinea fowl,\n(iv)\n4 000 female Muscovy or Peking ducks or 3 200 male Muscovy or Peking ducks or other ducks,\n(v)\n2 500 capons, geese or turkeys;\n(f)\nthe total usable area of poultry houses for meat production on any single unit, shall not exceed 1 600 m2;\n(g)\npoultry houses shall be constructed in a manner allowing all birds easy access to open air area.\n4.   Natural light may be supplemented by artificial means to provide a maximum of 16 hours light per day with a continuous nocturnal rest period without artificial light of at least eight hours.\n5.   To prevent the use of intensive rearing methods, poultry shall either be reared until they reach a minimum age or else shall come from slow-growing poultry strains. Where slow-growing poultry strains are not used by the operator the following minimum age at slaughter shall be:\n(a)\n81 days for chickens,\n(b)\n150 days for capons,\n(c)\n49 days for Peking ducks,\n(d)\n70 days for female Muscovy ducks,\n(e)\n84 days for male Muscovy ducks,\n(f)\n92 days for Mallard ducks,\n(g)\n94 days for guinea fowl,\n(h)\n140 days for male turkeys and roasting geese and\n(i)\n100 days for female turkeys.\nThe competent authority shall define the criteria of slow-growing strains or draw up a list thereof and provide this information to operators, other Member States and the Commission.\nArticle 13\nSpecific requirements and housing conditions in beekeeping\n1.   The siting of the apiaries shall be such that, within a radius of 3 km from the apiary site, nectar and pollen sources consist essentially of organically produced crops and/or spontaneous vegetation and/or crops treated with low environmental impact methods equivalent to those as described in Article 36 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 (12) or in Article 22 of Council Regulation 1257/1999 (13) which cannot affect the qualification of beekeeping production as being organic. The above mentioned requirements do not apply where flowering is not taking place, or the hives are dormant.\n2.   The Member States may designate regions or areas where beekeeping complying with organic production rules is not practicable.\n3.   The hives shall be made basically of natural materials presenting no risk of contamination to the environment or the apiculture products.\n4.   The bees wax for new foundations shall come from organic production units.\n5.   Without prejudice to Article 25, only natural products such as propolis, wax and plant oils can be used in the hives.\n6.   The use of chemical synthetic repellents is prohibited during honey extractions operations.\n7.

INTRODUCTION\nThe graphic manual is an instrument for the operators to reproduce the logo.\n2.   GENERAL USE OF THE LOGO\n2.1.   Coloured logo (reference colours)\nWhen the coloured logo is used, this logo must appear in colour by using direct colours (Pantone) or a four-coloured process. The reference colours are indicated herunder.\nLogo in pantone\nLogo in four-colour process\n2.2.   Single-colour logo: logo in black and white\nThe logo in black and white can be used as shown:\n2.3.   Contrast with background colours\nIf the logo is used in colour on coloured backgrounds which makes it difficult to read, use a delimiting outer circle around the logo to improve its contrast with the background colours as shown:\nLogo in coloured background\n2.4.   Typography\nUse Frutiger or Myriad bold condensed in capitals for the wording.\nThe letter size of the wording shall be reduced according to the norms set down in Section 2.6\n2.5.   Language\nYou are free to use the language version or versions of your choice according to the specifications indicated in B.3.\n2.6.   Reduction sizes\nIf the application of the logo on different types of labelling makes reduction necessary, the minimum size shall be:\n(a)\nFor a logo with a single indication: minimum size 20 mm diameter.\n(b)\nFor a logo with a combination of two indications: minimum size 40 mm diameter.\n2.7.   Particular conditions to use the logo\nThe use of the logo serves to confer specific value to the products.
