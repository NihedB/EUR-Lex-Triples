{"celex_id": "32014R0909", "reference": "28.8.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 257/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 909/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 July 2014\non improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories and amending Directives 98/26/EC and 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 236/2012\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCentral securities depositories (CSDs), together with central counterparties (CCPs) contribute to a large degree in maintaining post-trade infrastructures that safeguard financial markets and give market participants confidence that securities transactions are executed properly and in a timely manner, including during periods of extreme stress.\n(2)\nDue to their key position in the settlement process, the securities settlement systems operated by CSDs are of a systemic importance for the functioning of securities markets. Playing an important role in the securities holding systems through which their participants report the securities holdings of investors, the securities settlement systems operated by CSDs also serve as an essential tool to control the integrity of an issue, hindering the undue creation or reduction of issued securities, and thereby play an important role in maintaining investor confidence. Moreover, securities settlement systems operated by CSDs are closely involved in securing collateral for monetary policy operations as well as in securing collateral between credit institutions and are, therefore, important actors in the collateralisation process.\n(3)\nWhile Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) reduced the disruption to a securities settlement system caused by insolvency proceedings against a participant in that system, it is necessary to address other risks that securities settlement systems are facing, as well as the risk of insolvency or disruption in the functioning of the CSDs that operate securities settlement systems. A number of CSDs are subject to credit and liquidity risks deriving from the provision of banking services ancillary to settlement.\n(4)\nThe increasing number of cross-border settlements as a consequence of the development of link agreements between CSDs calls into question the resilience, in the absence of common prudential rules, of CSDs when importing the risks encountered by CSDs from other Member States. Moreover, despite the increase in cross-border settlements, market-driven changes towards a more integrated market for CSD services have proven to be very slow. An open internal market in securities settlement should allow any investor in the Union to invest in all Union securities with the same ease as in, and using the same processes as for, domestic securities. However, the settlement markets in the Union remain fragmented across national borders and cross-border settlement remains more costly, due to different national rules regulating settlement and the activities of CSDs and limited competition between CSDs. That fragmentation hinders and creates additional risks and costs for cross-border settlement. Given the systemic relevance of CSDs, competition between them should be promoted so as to enable market participants a choice of provider and reduce reliance on any one infrastructure provider. In the absence of identical obligations for market operators and common prudential standards for CSDs, divergent measures likely to be taken at national level will have a direct negative impact on the safety, efficiency and competition in the settlement markets in the Union. It is necessary to remove those significant obstacles in the functioning of the internal market and avoid distortions of competition and to prevent such obstacles and distortions from arising in the future. The creation of an integrated market for securities settlement with no distinction between national and cross-border securities transactions is needed for the proper functioning of the internal market. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation should be Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n(5)\nIt is necessary to lay down in a regulation a number of uniform obligations to be imposed on market participants regarding certain aspects of the settlement cycle and discipline and to provide a set of common requirements for CSDs operating securities settlement systems. The directly applicable rules of a regulation should ensure that all market operators and CSDs are subject to identical directly applicable obligations, standards and rules. A regulation should increase the safety and efficiency of settlement in the Union by preventing any diverging national rules as a result of the transposition of a directive. A regulation should reduce the regulatory complexity for market operators and CSDs resulting from different national rules and should allow CSDs to provide their services on a cross-border basis without having to comply with different sets of national requirements such as those concerning the authorisation, supervision, organisation or risks of CSDs. A regulation imposing identical requirements on CSDs should also contribute to eliminating competitive distortions.\n(6)\nOn 20 October 2010, the Financial Stability Board called for more robust core market infrastructures and asked for the revision and enhancement of the existing standards. In April 2012, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) adopted global standards for financial market infrastructures. Those standards have replaced the BIS recommendations of 2001, which were adapted through non-binding guidelines at European level in 2009 by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Committee of European Securities Regulators. Taking into account the global nature of financial markets and the systemic importance of CSDs, it is necessary to ensure international convergence of the prudential requirements to which they are subject. This Regulation should follow the existing principles for financial market infrastructures developed by CPSS-IOSCO. The Commission and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (‘ESMA’), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, should ensure consistency with the existing standards and their future developments when drawing up or proposing to revise the regulatory technical standards and the implementing technical standards as well as the guidelines and recommendations referred to in this Regulation.\n(7)\nThe Council, in its conclusions of 2 December 2008, emphasised the need to strengthen the safety and soundness of the securities settlement systems, and to address legal barriers to post-trading in the Union.\n(8)\nOne of the basic tasks of the ESCB is to promote the smooth operation of payment systems. In this respect, the members of the ESCB execute oversight by ensuring efficient and sound clearing and payment systems. The members of the ESCB often act as settlement agents for the cash leg of securities transactions. They are also significant clients of CSDs, which often manage the collateralisation of monetary policy operations. The members of the ESCB should be closely involved, by being consulted, in the authorisation and supervision of CSDs, the recognition of third-country CSDs and the approval of certain CSD links. To prevent the emergence of parallel sets of rules, they should also be closely involved by being consulted in the setting of regulatory and implementing technical standards as well as of guidelines and recommendations although primary responsibility for the setting of such technical standards, guidelines and recommendations should rest with the Commission and ESMA, as laid down in this Regulation. This Regulation should be without prejudice to the responsibilities of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the Union and other countries. This Regulation should not prevent the members of the ESCB from accessing the information relevant for the performance of their duties, including the oversight of CSDs and other financial market infrastructures.\n(9)\nThe members of the ESCB, any other bodies performing similar functions in certain Member States or other public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt in the Union may themselves provide a number of services, such as operating a securities settlement system, which would qualify them as a CSD. Such entities, when acting as CSDs without establishing a separate entity, should be exempt from the authorisation and supervision requirements, certain organisational requirements and capital and investment policy requirements, but should remain subject to the remaining prudential requirements for CSDs. Where such Member State entities act as CSDs, they should not provide their services in other Member States. Since the members of the ESCB act as settlement agents for the purpose of settlement, they should also be exempt from the requirements set out in Title IV of this Regulation.\n(10)\nThis Regulation should apply to the settlement of transactions in all financial instruments and activities of CSDs unless specified otherwise. This Regulation should also be without prejudice to other legislation of the Union concerning specific financial instruments such as Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and measures adopted in accordance with that Directive.\n(11)\nThe recording of securities in book-entry form is an important step towards increasing the efficiency of settlement and ensuring the integrity of a securities issue, especially in a context of increasing complexity of holding and transfer methods. For reasons of safety, this Regulation provides for the recording in book-entry form of all transferable securities admitted to trading or traded on the trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and by Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). This Regulation should not impose one particular method for the initial book-entry recording, which should be able to take the form of immobilisation or of immediate dematerialisation. This Regulation should not impose the type of institution that is to record securities in book-entry form upon issuance but, rather, should permit different actors, including registrars, to perform that function. However, once transactions in such securities are executed on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 or provided as collateral under the conditions laid down in Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), such securities should be recorded in a CSD book-entry system in order to ensure, inter alia, that all such securities can be settled in a securities settlement system. Immobilisation and dematerialisation should not imply any loss of rights for the holders of securities and should be achieved in a way that ensures that holders of securities can verify their rights.\n(12)\nIn order to ensure the safety of settlement, any participant in a securities settlement system buying or selling certain financial instruments, namely transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances, should settle its obligation on the intended settlement date.\n(13)\nLonger settlement periods for transactions in transferable securities cause uncertainty and increased risk for securities settlement systems participants. Different durations of settlement periods across Member States hamper reconciliation and are sources of errors for issuers, investors and intermediaries. It is therefore necessary to provide a common settlement period which would facilitate the identification of the intended settlement date and facilitate the implementation of settlement discipline measures. The intended settlement date of transactions in transferable securities which are executed on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be no later than on the second business day after the trading takes place. For complex operations composed of several transactions such as securities repurchase or lending agreements, that requirement should apply to the first transaction involving a transfer of securities. Given their non-standardised character, that requirement should not apply to transactions that are negotiated privately by the relevant parties, but executed on the trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 or to transactions that are executed bilaterally, but reported to a trading venue regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. Moreover, that requirement should not apply to the first transaction where the transferable securities concerned are subject to initial recording in book-entry form.\n(14)\nCSDs and other market infrastructures should take measures to prevent and address settlement fails. It is essential that such rules be uniformly and directly applied in the Union. In particular, CSDs and other market infrastructures should be required to put in place procedures enabling them to take appropriate measures to suspend any participant that systematically causes settlement fails and to disclose its identity to the public, provided that that participant has the opportunity to submit observations before such a decision is taken.\n(15)\nOne of the most efficient ways to address settlement fails is to require failing participants to be subject to a compulsory enforcement of the original agreement. This Regulation should provide for uniform rules concerning penalties and certain aspects of the buy-in transaction for all transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances, such as timing and pricing. Those rules should be adapted to the specificities of different securities markets, certain trading venues such as SME growth markets as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU and certain complex operations such as very short-term securities repurchase or lending agreements, in order to avoid adversely impacting on the liquidity and efficiency of securities markets. The rules on settlement discipline should be applied in a manner that provides an incentive for the settlement of transactions in all relevant financial instruments by their intended settlement date.\n(16)\nThe procedures and penalties relating to settlement fails should be commensurate with the scale and seriousness of such fails whilst being scaled in such a way that maintains and protects the liquidity of the relevant financial instruments. In particular, market-making activities play a crucial role in providing liquidity to markets within the Union, particularly to less liquid securities. Measures to prevent and address settlement fails should be balanced against the need to maintain and protect liquidity in those securities. Cash penalties imposed on failing participants should, where possible, be credited to the non-failing clients as compensation and should not, in any event, become a source of revenue for the CSD concerned. CSDs should consult the market infrastructures in respect of which they provide CSD services on the implementation of settlement discipline measures laid down in this Regulation.\n(17)\nIn most cases a buy-in process should be initiated where the financial instruments are not delivered within four business days of the intended settlement date. However, for illiquid financial instruments it is appropriate that the period before initiating the buy-in process should be increased to a maximum of seven business days. The basis for determining when financial instruments are deemed to be illiquid should be established through regulatory technical standards, taking account of the assessments already made in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. Where such a determination is made the extension of the deadline for initiating the buy-in process should be up to seven business days.\n(18)\nIt is appropriate to allow SME growth markets the flexibility not to apply the buy-in process until up to 15 days after the trade has taken place so as to take into account the liquidity of such markets and to allow, in particular, for activity by market-makers in those less liquid markets. The settlement discipline measures specific to SME growth markets should apply only to transactions executed on such markets. As identified in the Commission Staff Working Paper of 7 December 2011 accompanying the Commission communication entitled, ‘An action plan to improve access to finance for SMEs’, access to capital markets should be developed as an alternative to bank lending to SMEs and it is therefore appropriate to tailor the rules to better serve the needs of those SME growth markets.\n(19)\nCSDs should be allowed to monitor the execution of a buy-in with respect to multiple settlement instructions on the same financial instruments and with the same date of expiry of the extension period with the aim of minimising the number of buy-ins to the extent compatible with the requirements of this Regulation.\n(20)\nAs the main purpose of this Regulation is to introduce a number of legal obligations imposed directly on market operators consisting, inter alia, of the recording in book-entry form in CSDs of all transferable securities once such securities are traded on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 or provided as collateral under the conditions of Directive 2002/47/EC and in the settling of their obligations no later than on the second business day after trading takes place and as CSDs are responsible for the operation of securities settlement systems and the application of measures to provide timely settlement in the Union, it is essential to ensure that all CSDs are safe and sound and comply at all times with stringent organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements laid down in this Regulation, including by taking all reasonable steps to mitigate fraud and negligence. Uniform and directly applicable rules regarding the authorisation and ongoing supervision of CSDs are therefore an essential corollary of and are interrelated with the legal obligations imposed on market participants by this Regulation. It is, therefore, necessary to include rules regarding the authorisation and supervision of CSDs in the same act as the legal obligations imposed on market participants.\n(21)\nTaking into account that CSDs should be subject to common requirements and in order to dismantle the existing barriers to cross-border settlement, any authorised CSDs should enjoy the freedom to provide services within the territory of the Union, including through setting up a branch. In order to ensure an appropriate level of safety in the provision of services by CSDs in another Member State, such CSDs should be subject to a specific procedure laid down in this Regulation where they intend to provide certain core services as provided for in this Regulation or set up a branch in a host Member State.\n(22)\nWithin a borderless Union settlement market, it is necessary to establish the competences of the different authorities involved in the application of this Regulation. Member States should specifically designate the competent authorities responsible for the application of this Regulation, which should be afforded the supervisory and investigatory powers necessary for the exercise of their functions. A CSD should be subject to authorisation and supervision by the competent authority of its home Member State, which is well placed and should be empowered to examine how CSDs operate on a daily basis, to carry out regular reviews and to take appropriate action when necessary. The competent authority concerned should however consult at the earliest stage and cooperate with other relevant authorities, which include the authorities responsible for the oversight of each securities settlement system operated by the CSD, the central banks that issue the most relevant settlement currencies, where applicable, the relevant central banks that act as settlement agent for each securities settlement system, and, also, where applicable, the competent authorities of other group entities. Such cooperation also implies exchanges of information between the authorities concerned and the immediate notification of those authorities in the case of an emergency situation affecting the liquidity and stability of the financial system in any of the Member States where the CSD or any of its participants is established.\n(23)\nWhere a CSD provides its services in another Member State, the competent authority of the host Member State should be able to request from the competent authority of the home Member State all information concerning the activities of the CSD that is of relevance to the requesting authority. In order to enable effective coordination of supervision, that information could concern in particular the services provided to CSD users established in the host Member State or the instruments or currencies processed and may include information on adverse developments, results of risk assessments and remedial measures. The competent authority of the home Member State should also have access to any information periodically reported by the CSD to the competent authority of the host Member State.\n(24)\nWhere a CSD provides its services in a Member State other than the Member State where it is established, including through setting up a branch, the competent authority of its home Member State is mainly responsible for the supervision of that CSD. When the activities of a CSD in a host Member State have become of substantial importance for the functioning of the securities markets and the protection of the investors in that host Member State, the competent authorities and relevant authorities of the home Member State and of the host Member State should establish cooperation arrangements for the supervision of the activities of that CSD in the host Member State. The competent authority of the home Member State should also be able to decide that those cooperation arrangements envisage multilateral cooperation, including cooperation of a collegial nature, between the competent authority of the home Member State and the competent authorities and relevant authorities of the host Member States concerned. Such cooperation arrangements, however, should not be considered to be colleges of supervisors as referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. No Member State or group of Member States should be discriminated against directly or indirectly, as a location for CSD and settlement services. While performing its duties under this Regulation no authority should directly or indirectly discriminate against any undertaking from another Member State. Subject to this Regulation, a CSD from one Member State should not be restricted in or prevented from settling financial instruments in the currency of another Member State or in the currency of a third country.\n(25)\nThis Regulation should not prevent Member States from requiring in their national law a specific legal framework for day-to-day cooperation at national level between the competent authority of the CSD and relevant authorities. Such a national legal framework should be consistent with the guidelines concerning supervisory practices and cooperation between authorities that ESMA may issue under this Regulation.\n(26)\nAny legal person falling within the scope of the definition of a CSD needs to be authorised by the competent national authorities before starting its activities. Taking into account different business models, a CSD should be defined by reference to certain core services, which consist of settlement, implying the operation of a securities settlement system, notary and central securities accounts maintenance services. A CSD should at least operate a securities settlement system and provide one other core service. This combination is essential for CSDs to play their role in securities settlement and in ensuring the integrity of a securities issue. Entities that do not operate securities settlement systems such as registrars, transfer agents, public authorities, bodies in charge of a registry system established under Directive 2003/87/EC, or CCPs that are regulated by Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) do not fall within the scope of the definition of a CSD.\n(27)\nCSDs should have in place recovery plans to ensure continuity of their critical operations. Without prejudice to Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), the competent authorities should ensure that an adequate resolution plan is established and maintained for each CSD in accordance with the relevant national law.\n(28)\nIn order to provide reliable data on the scale of securities settlement outside securities settlement systems and to ensure that the risks arising can be monitored and addressed, any institutions other than CSDs that settle securities transactions outside a securities settlement system should report their settlement activities to the competent authorities concerned. The recipient competent authorities should subsequently transmit that information to ESMA and should inform ESMA of any potential risk resulting from such settlement activities. Furthermore, ESMA should monitor such settlement activities and take into account the potential risks that they might create.\n(29)\nIn order to avoid any risk-taking by CSDs in activities other than those subject to authorisation under this Regulation, the activities of authorised CSDs should be limited to the provision of services covered by their authorisation or notified under this Regulation and they should not hold any participation, as defined in this Regulation by reference to the Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), or any ownership, direct or indirect, of 20 % or more of the voting rights or capital in any institutions other than those providing similar services unless such a participation is approved by CSDs’ competent authorities on the basis that it does not significantly increase the CSDs’ risk profile.\n(30)\nIn order to ensure the safe functioning of the securities settlement systems, they should be operated only by the CSDs or by central banks acting as CSDs, subject to this Regulation.\n(31)\nWithout prejudice to specific requirements of Member State tax law, CSDs should be authorised to provide services ancillary to their core services that contribute to enhancing the safety, efficiency and transparency of the securities markets and that do not create undue risks to their core services. A non-exhaustive list of those services is set out in this Regulation in order to enable CSDs to respond to future market developments. Where the provision of such services relates to withholding and reporting obligations to the tax authorities, it will continue to be carried out in accordance with the law of the Member States concerned. In accordance with Article 114(2) TFEU, the power to adopt measures under Article 114(1) does not apply to fiscal provisions. In its judgement of 29 April 2004 in Case C-338/01 Commission v Council\n (13), the Court of Justice of the European Union held that the words ‘fiscal provisions’ are to be interpreted as ‘covering not only the provisions determining taxable persons, taxable transactions, the basis of imposition, and rates of and exemptions from direct and indirect taxes, but also those relating to arrangements for the collection of such taxes.’ This Regulation does not therefore cover arrangements for the collection of taxes for which a different legal basis would need to be used.\n(32)\nA CSD intending to outsource a core service to a third party or to provide a new core service or an ancillary service not listed in this Regulation, to operate another securities settlement system, to use another settlement agent or to set up any CSD links that involve significant risks should apply for authorisation following the same procedure as that required for initial authorisation, save that the competent authority should inform the applicant CSD within three months whether authorisation has been granted or refused. However, CSD links not involving significant risks or interoperable links of CSDs that outsource their services relating to those interoperable links to public entities, such as the members of the ESCB, should not be subject to prior authorisation, but should be notified by the relevant CSDs to their competent authorities.\n(33)\nWhere a CSD intends to extend its services to non-banking type ancillary services explicitly listed in this Regulation which do not entail an increase in its risk profile, it should be able to do so following notification to the competent authority of its home Member State.\n(34)\nCSDs established in third countries should be able to offer their services in the Union, including through the setting-up of a branch. In order to ensure an appropriate level of safety in the provision of CSD services by third-country CSDs, such CSDs should be subject to recognition by ESMA where they intend to provide certain services listed in this Regulation or to set up a branch in the Union. Third-country CSDs should be able to set up links with CSDs established in the Union in the absence of such recognition provided that the relevant competent authority does not object. In view of the global nature of financial markets, ESMA is best placed to recognise third-country CSDs. ESMA should be able to recognise third-country CSDs only if the Commission concludes that they are subject to a legal and supervisory framework effectively equivalent to the one provided in this Regulation, if they are effectively authorised, supervised and subject to oversight in their country of establishment and cooperation arrangements have been established between ESMA, the competent authorities and relevant authorities of CSDs. Recognition by ESMA should be subject to an effective equivalent recognition of the prudential framework applicable to CSDs established in the Union and authorised under this Regulation.\n(35)\nTaking into account the complexity as well as the systemic nature of the CSDs and of the services they provide, transparent governance rules should ensure that senior management, members of the management body, shareholders and participants, who are in a position to exercise control, as defined by reference to the Directive 2013/34/EU, over the operation of the CSD are suitable to ensure the sound and prudent management of the CSD.\n(36)\nDifferent governance structures are used across Member States. In most cases a unitary or a dual board structure is used. The definitions used in this Regulation are intended to embrace all existing structures without advocating any particular structure. They are purely functional for the purpose of setting out rules aiming to achieve a particular outcome irrespective of the national company law applicable to an institution in each Member State. The definitions should therefore not interfere with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law.\n(37)\nTransparent governance rules should ensure that the interests of the shareholders, the management and staff of the CSD, on the one hand, and the interests of their users whom CSDs are ultimately serving, on the other, are taken into account. Those governance rules should apply without prejudice to the ownership model adopted by the CSD. User committees should be established for each securities settlement system operated by the CSD to give users the opportunity to advise the management body of the CSD on the key issues that impact them and should be given the tools to perform their role. The interests of different users of CSDs, including those of holders of different types of securities, should be represented in the user committee.\n(38)\nCSDs should be able to outsource the operation of their services provided that the risks arising from such outsourcing arrangements are managed. Taking into account the significance of the tasks entrusted to CSDs, this Regulation should provide that CSDs do not transfer their responsibilities to third parties through the outsourcing by contract of their activities to third parties. Outsourcing of such activities should be subject to strict conditions that maintain the responsibility of CSDs for their activities and ensure that the supervision and oversight of the CSDs are not impaired. It should be possible to exempt outsourcing by a CSD of its activities to a public entity from those requirements under certain conditions.\n(39)\nThis Regulation should not prevent Member States allowing direct securities holding systems from providing in their national law that parties other than CSDs shall or may perform certain functions, which in some other types of securities holding systems are typically performed by CSDs and specifying how those functions should be exercised. In particular, in some Member States account operators or participants in the securities settlement systems operated by CSDs record entries into securities accounts maintained by CSDs without necessarily being account providers themselves. In view of the need for legal certainty on the entries made into accounts at the CSD level, the specific role played by such other parties should be recognised by this Regulation. It should therefore be possible, under specific circumstances and subject to strict rules laid down by law, to share the responsibility between a CSD and the relevant other party or to provide for exclusive responsibility by that other party for certain aspects related to maintaining of securities accounts at the top tier level provided that such other party is subject to appropriate regulation and supervision. There should be no restrictions on the extent to which responsibility is shared.\n(40)\nConduct of business rules should provide transparency in the relations between CSDs and their users. In particular, CSDs should have publicly disclosed, transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria for participation in the securities settlement system, which would allow restriction of access by participants only on the basis of the risks involved. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs to provide their services to participants. CSDs should publicly disclose prices and fees for their services. In order to provide open and non-discriminatory access to their services and in view of the significant market power that CSDs still enjoy in the territory of their respective Member States, CSDs should not be able to diverge from their published pricing policy for their core services and should maintain separate accounts for the costs and revenues associated with each of their core services and with their ancillary services. Those participation provisions complement and reinforce the right of market participants to use a settlement system in another Member State provided for in Directive 2014/65/EU.\n(41)\nIn order to facilitate efficient recording, settlement and payment, CSDs should accommodate in their communication procedures with participants and with the market infrastructures they interface with, the relevant international open communication procedures and standards for messaging and reference data.\n(42)\nTaking into account the central role of securities settlement systems in the financial markets, CSDs should, when providing their services, make best efforts to ensure the timely settlement of securities transactions and the integrity of the securities issue. This Regulation should not interfere with the national law of the Member States regulating the holdings of securities and the arrangements maintaining the integrity of securities issues. However, in order to enhance the protection of the assets of their participants and those of their clients, this Regulation should require CSDs to segregate the securities accounts maintained for each participant and offer, upon request, further segregation of the accounts of the participants’ clients which in some cases might be available only at a higher cost to be borne by the participants’ clients requesting further segregation. CSDs and their participants should be required to provide for both omnibus client segregation and individual client segregation so clients can choose the level of segregation they believe is appropriate to their needs.\nThe only exclusion from this should be where due to other public policy requirements, in particular in relation to efficient and transparent collection of taxation, a CSD and its participants are required to provide individual client segregation for citizens and residents of and legal persons established in a Member State where, at the date of entry into force of this Regulation, such individual client segregation is required under the national law of the Member State under which the securities are constituted and only for citizens, residents of and legal persons established in that Member State. CSDs should ensure that those requirements apply separately to each securities settlement system operated by them. Without prejudice to the provision of ancillary services, CSDs should not use on their own account any securities that belong to a participant unless explicitly authorised by that participant and should not otherwise use on their own account the securities that do not belong to them. In addition the CSD should require the participants to obtain any necessary prior consent from their clients.\n(43)\nDirective 98/26/EC provides that transfer orders entered into securities settlement systems in accordance with the rules of those systems should be legally enforceable and binding on third parties. However, since Directive 98/26/EC does not specifically refer to CSDs that operate securities settlement systems, for clarity, this Regulation should require CSDs to define the moment or moments when transfer orders are entered into their systems and become irrevocable in accordance with the rules of that Directive. In addition, in order to increase legal certainty, CSDs should disclose to their participants the moment when the transfer of securities and cash in a securities settlement system is legally enforceable and binding on third parties in accordance, as the case may be, with national law. CSDs should also take all reasonable steps to ensure that transfers of securities and cash are legally enforceable and binding on third parties no later than at the end of the business day of the actual settlement date.\n(44)\nIn order to avoid settlement risks due to the insolvency of the settlement agent, a CSD should settle, whenever practical and available, the cash leg of the securities transaction through accounts opened with a central bank. If this option is not practical and available, a CSD should be able to settle through accounts opened with a credit institution established under the conditions provided in Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and subject to a specific authorisation procedure and prudential requirements provided in Title IV of this Regulation.\n(45)\nBanking services ancillary to settlement involving credit and liquidity risks should only be undertaken by CSDs or outsourced to entities authorised to provide the banking services ancillary to the CSD activities as laid down in this Regulation.\n(46)\nIn order to secure efficiencies resulting from the provision of both CSD and banking services within the same group of undertakings, the requirements of this Regulation should not prevent credit institutions from belonging to the same group of undertakings as the CSD. It is appropriate to provide for arrangements under which CSDs could be authorised to provide to their participants and to other entities ancillary services from within the same legal entity or from within a separate legal entity which may be part of the same group of undertakings ultimately controlled by the same parent undertaking or not. Where a credit institution other than a central bank acts as a settlement agent, the credit institution should be able to provide to the CSD participants the services set out in this Regulation, which are covered by the authorisation, but should not provide other banking services from the same legal entity in order to limit the settlement system’s exposure to the risks resulting from the failure of the credit institution.\n(47)\nSince Directive 2013/36/EU does not specifically address intra-day credit and liquidity risks resulting from the provision of banking services ancillary to settlement, credit institutions and CSDs providing such services should also be subject to specific enhanced credit and liquidity risk mitigation requirements, including a risk-based capital surcharge which reflects the relevant risks. Such enhanced credit and liquidity risk mitigation requirements should follow the global standards for financial market infrastructures and the principles for ‘Monitoring tools for intra-day liquidity management’ published in April 2013 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n(48)\nSome CSDs also operating as credit institutions are subject to own funds and reporting requirements relevant for credit institutions and laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) and in Directive 2013/36/EU. Given the systemic importance of such CSDs it is appropriate that the strictest requirements provided in Union law apply in order to avoid the cumulative application of various Union rules, for example in relation to the reporting of own funds requirements. In any areas where potential duplication of requirements is identified, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (‘EBA’) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) and ESMA should provide an opinion on the appropriate application of the Union acts in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n(49)\nIn addition to the own funds requirements provided for in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Directive 2013/36/EU, credit institutions and CSDs should be subject to a capital surcharge that reflects the risks, such as credit and liquidity risks, resulting from the provision of intra-day credit, inter alia, to the participants in a securities settlement system or other users of CSD services.\n(50)\nIn order to ensure full compliance with specific measures aimed at mitigating credit and liquidity risks, the competent authorities should be able to require CSDs to designate more than one credit institution whenever they can demonstrate, based on the available evidence, that the exposures of one credit institution to the concentration of credit and liquidity risks is not fully mitigated. CSDs should also be able to designate more than one credit institution.\n(51)\nSupervision of the compliance of designated credit institutions or CSDs authorised to provide banking services ancillary to settlement with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and of Directive 2013/36/EU and the specific relevant prudential requirements of this Regulation should be entrusted to the competent authorities referred to in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In order to ensure consistent application of supervisory standards, it is desirable that the banking services of CSDs which are of a scale and nature to pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the Union are directly supervised by the ECB under the conditions provided for in Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (17) concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions. This Regulation should be without prejudice to Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.\n(52)\nA credit institution or a CSD authorised to provide banking services ancillary to settlement should comply with any present or future Union legislation applicable to credit institutions. This Regulation should be without prejudice to Directive 2014/59/EU and any future Union legislative act regarding the framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and other financial institutions.\n(53)\nIn order to provide a sufficient degree of safety and continuity of services provided by CSDs, CSDs should be subject to specific uniform and directly applicable prudential and capital requirements which mitigate their legal, operational and investment risks.\n(54)\nThe safety of the link arrangements set up between CSDs should be subject to specific requirements to enable the access of their respective participants to other securities settlement systems. The provision of banking-type ancillary services from within a separate legal entity should not prevent CSDs from receiving such services, in particular when they are participants in a securities settlement system operated by another CSD. It is particularly important that any potential risks resulting from the link arrangements such as credit, liquidity, organisational or any other relevant risks for CSDs are fully mitigated. For interoperable links, it is important that linked securities settlement systems have identical moments of entry of transfer orders into the system and irrevocability of such transfer orders and use equivalent rules concerning the moment of finality of transfers of securities and cash. The same principles should apply to CSDs that use a common settlement information technology (IT) infrastructure.\n(55)\nIn order to allow competent authorities to supervise the activities of CSDs effectively, CSDs should be subject to strict record-keeping requirements. CSDs should maintain for at least 10 years all the records and data on all the services that they may provide, including transaction data on collateral management services that involve the processing of securities repurchase or lending agreements. CSDs might need to specify a common format in which their clients provide transaction data so as to allow this record-keeping requirement to be met, in conformity with any relevant regulatory and implementing technical standards adopted under this Regulation.\n(56)\nIn many Member States issuers are required by national law to issue certain types of securities, notably shares, within their national CSDs. In order to remove this barrier to the smooth functioning of the Union post-trading market and to allow issuers to opt for the most efficient way of managing their securities, issuers should have the right to choose any CSD established in the Union for recording their securities and receiving any relevant CSD services. Since harmonisation of national corporate law is beyond the scope of this Regulation, such national corporate or similar law under which the securities are constituted should continue to apply and arrangements be made to ensure that the requirements of such national corporate or similar law can be met where the right of choice of CSD is exercised. Such national corporate and similar law under which the securities are constituted govern the relationship between their issuer and holders or any third parties, and their respective rights and duties attached to the securities such as voting rights, dividends and corporate actions. A refusal to provide services to an issuer should be permissible only based on a comprehensive risk assessment or if that CSD does not provide any issuance services in relation to securities constituted under the corporate or similar law of the relevant Member State. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs to provide their services to issuers.\n(57)\nIn view of the increasing cross-border holdings and transfers of securities enhanced by this Regulation, it is of the utmost urgency and importance to establish clear rules on the law applicable to proprietary aspects in relation to the securities held in the accounts maintained by CSDs. Nevertheless, this is a horizontal issue which goes beyond the scope of this Regulation and could be dealt with in future Union legislative acts.\n(58)\nThe European Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settlement of 7 November 2006 created a voluntary framework to enable access between CSDs and other market infrastructures. However, the post-trade sector remains fragmented along national lines, making cross-border trade unnecessarily costly. It is necessary to lay down uniform conditions for links between CSDs and of access between CSDs and other market infrastructures. In order to enable CSDs to offer their participants access to other markets, they should have a right to become a participant in another CSD or request another CSD to develop special functions for having access to the latter. Such access should be granted on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and should be refused only where it threatens the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets or causes systemic risk. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of a CSD to grant access to another CSD. Where CSD links introduce significant risks for settlement, they should be subject to authorisation and increased supervision by the relevant competent authorities.\n(59)\nCSDs should also have access to transaction feeds from a CCP or a trading venue and those market infrastructures should have access to the securities settlement systems operated by CSDs. Such access may be refused only where it threatens the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets or causes systemic risk and may not be denied on the grounds of loss of market share.\n(60)\nA quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs or market infrastructures to provide access to their services. This Regulation completes the access arrangements between trading venues, CCPs, and CSDs as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 necessary to establish a competitive internal market in post-trade services. ESMA and the Commission should continue to monitor closely the evolution of post-trade infrastructure and the Commission should, where necessary, intervene in order to prevent competitive distortions from occurring in the internal market.\n(61)\nA sound prudential and conduct of business framework for the financial sector should rest on strong supervisory and sanctioning regimes. To that end, supervisory authorities should be equipped with sufficient powers to act and should be able to rely on deterrent sanctioning regimes to be used against any unlawful conduct. A review of existing sanctioning powers and their practical application aiming to promote convergence of sanctions across the range of supervisory activities has been carried out in the Commission Communication of 8 December 2010 entitled ‘Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial services sector’.\n(62)\nTherefore, in order to ensure effective compliance by CSDs, credit institutions designated as settlement agents, the members of their management bodies and any other persons who effectively control their business or any other persons with the requirements of this Regulation, competent authorities should be able to apply administrative sanctions and other measures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(63)\nIn order to provide deterrence and consistent application of the sanctions across Member States, this Regulation should provide a list of key administrative sanctions and other measures that need to be available to the competent authorities, for the power to impose those sanctions and other measures on all persons, whether legal or natural, responsible for an infringement, for a list of key criteria when determining the level and type of those sanctions and other measures and for levels of administrative pecuniary sanctions. Administrative fines should take into account factors such as any identified financial benefit resulting from the infringement, the gravity and duration of the infringement, any aggravating or mitigating factors, the need for administrative fines to have a deterrent effect and, where appropriate, include a discount for cooperation with the competent authority. The adoption and publication of sanctions should respect fundamental rights as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’), in particular the rights to respect for private and family life (Article 7), the right to the protection of personal data (Article 8) and the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial (Article 47).\n(64)\nIn order to detect potential infringements, effective mechanisms to encourage reporting of potential or actual infringements of this Regulation to the competent authorities should be put in place. Those mechanisms should include adequate safeguards for the persons who report potential or actual infringements of this Regulation and the persons accused of such infringements. Appropriate procedures should be established to comply with the accused person’s right to protection of personal data, with the right of defence and to be heard before the adoption of a final decision affecting that person as well as with the right to seek effective remedy before a tribunal against any decision or measure affecting that person.\n(65)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to any provisions in the law of Member States relating to criminal sanctions.\n(66)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18) governs the processing of personal data carried out in the Member States pursuant to this Regulation. Any exchange or transmission of personal data by competent authorities of the Member States should be undertaken in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) governs the processing of personal data carried out by ESMA pursuant to this Regulation. Any exchange or transmission of personal data carried out by ESMA should be in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n(67)\nThis Regulation complies with the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter, notably the rights to respect for private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence, and the freedom to conduct a business, and has to be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(68)\nESMA should play a central role in the application of this Regulation by ensuring consistent application of Union rules by national competent authorities and by settling disagreements between them.\n(69)\nESMA should submit annual reports to the Commission assessing the trends and potential risks in the markets covered by this Regulation. Those reports should include at least an assessment of settlement efficiency, internalised settlement, cross-border provision of services, the reasons for the rejection of access rights and any other substantive barriers to competition in post-trade financial services including any barriers arising from the inappropriate use of licensing arrangements, appropriateness of penalties for settlement fails, in particular the need for additional flexibility in relation to penalties for settlement fails in relation to illiquid financial instruments, the application of Member States’ rules on civil liability to losses attributable to CSDs, the conditions relating to the provision of banking-type ancillary services, requirements regarding the protection of securities of participants and those of their clients, and the sanctions regime and may contain, where necessary, recommendations of preventative or remedial actions. ESMA should also conduct peer reviews covering the activities of the competent authorities under this Regulation within an appropriate time-frame and in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. Given the systemic importance of CSDs and the fact that they are being regulated for the first time at Union level, it is appropriate to require that such peer reviews should initially occur every three years at least in relation to the supervision of CSDs which make use of the freedom to provide services or participate in an interoperable link.\n(70)\nAs a body with highly specialised expertise regarding securities and securities markets, it is efficient and appropriate to entrust ESMA with the development of draft regulatory and implementing technical standards which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission. Where specified, ESMA should also closely cooperate with the members of the ESCB and EBA.\n(71)\nThe Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards in accordance with Article 290 TFEU and with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 with regard to the detailed elements of the settlement discipline measures; the reporting of internalised settlement; information and other elements to be included by a CSD in its application for authorisation; conditions under which the competent authorities of CSDs may approve their participations in the capital of certain legal entities, the information that different authorities shall supply each other when supervising CSDs; the information that the applicant CSD shall provide ESMA in its application for recognition; the elements of the governance arrangements for CSDs; the details of the records to be kept by CSDs; the risks to be taken into account by CSDs when carrying out a comprehensive risk assessment, and competent authorities assessing the reasons for refusal of requests for access; the elements of the procedure for access of participants and issuers to CSDs, access between CSDs and between CSDs and other market infrastructures; the details of the measures to be taken by CSDs so that the integrity of the issue is maintained; the mitigation of the operational and investment risks and of the risks derived from the CSD links; the details of the capital requirements for CSDs; the details of the application for authorisation to provide banking-type ancillary services; the capital surcharge and the prudential requirements on credit and liquidity risks for CSDs and designated credit institutions that are authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services.\n(72)\nThe Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 with regard to standard forms and templates for reporting on internalised settlement; for the application for authorisation by CSDs; for the provision of information between different competent authorities for the purposes of supervision of CSDs; for the relevant cooperation arrangements between authorities of home and host Member States; for formats of records to be kept by CSDs; for the procedures in cases where a participant or an issuer is denied access to a CSD, CSDs are denied access between themselves or between CSDs and other market infrastructures; and for the consultation of different authorities prior to granting authorisation to a settlement agent.\n(73)\nIn order to attain the objectives set out in this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specific details concerning some definitions, parameters for the calculation of cash penalties for the participants that cause settlement fails, the criteria under which the operations of a CSD in a host Member State should be considered to be of substantial importance for that Member State. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(74)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to take decisions on the assessment of rules from third countries for the purposes of recognition of third-country CSDs. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20).\n(75)\nWhen assessing the relevant rules of third countries, a proportionate, outcomes-based approach should be taken, focusing on compliance with applicable Union rules and, where relevant, international standards. Conditional or interim recognition may also be granted where there are no areas of substantive difference that would have foreseeable detrimental effects on Union markets.\n(76)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to lay down uniform requirements for settlement as well as for CSDs, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(77)\nIt is necessary to amend Directive 98/26/EC to bring it in line with the Directive 2010/78/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), whereby designated securities settlement systems are no longer notified to the Commission but to ESMA.\n(78)\nTaking into account the fact that this Regulation harmonises at Union level the measures to prevent and address settlement fails and has a wider scope of application for such measures than Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22), it is necessary to repeal Article 15 of that Regulation.\n(79)\nCSDs should be exempt from the application of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 where they provide services that are explicitly listed in this Regulation. However, in order to ensure that any entities providing investment services and activities are subject to Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and to avoid competitive distortions between different types of providers of such services, it is necessary to require CSDs that provide investment services and activities in the course of their ancillary services to be subject to the requirements of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.\n(80)\nThe application of the authorisation and recognition requirements of this Regulation should be deferred in order to provide CSDs established in the Union or in third countries with sufficient time to apply for authorisation and recognition of their activities provided for in this Regulation. Until a decision is made under this Regulation on the authorisation or recognition of CSDs and of their activities, including CSD links, the respective national rules on authorisation and recognition of CSDs should continue to apply.\n(81)\nIt is also necessary to defer the application of the requirements concerning settlement discipline and requirements concerning reporting obligation of settlement internalisers until all the necessary delegated or implementing acts further specifying such requirements are in place, and of the requirements for recording certain transferable securities in book-entry form and settling obligations in securities settlement systems no later than on the second business day after the trading in order to provide market participants, holding securities in paper form or using longer settlement periods, with sufficient time to comply with those requirements,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation lays down uniform requirements for the settlement of financial instruments in the Union and rules on the organisation and conduct of central securities depositories (CSDs) to promote safe, efficient and smooth settlement.\n2.

Trading venues shall establish procedures that enable the confirmation of relevant details of transactions in financial instruments referred to in Article 5(1) on the date when the transaction has been executed.\n2.   Notwithstanding the requirement laid down in paragraph 1, investment firms authorised pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2014/65/EU shall, where applicable, take measures to limit the number of settlement fails.\nSuch measures shall at least consist of arrangements between the investment firm and its professional clients as referred to in Annex II to Directive 2014/65/EU to ensure the prompt communication of an allocation of securities to the transaction, confirmation of that allocation and confirmation of the acceptance or rejection of terms in good time before the intended settlement date.\nESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 on the standardised procedures and messaging protocols to be used for complying with the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n3.   For each securities settlement system it operates, a CSD shall establish procedures that facilitate the settlement of transactions in financial instruments referred to in Article 5(1) on the intended settlement date with a minimum exposure of its participants to counterparty and liquidity risks and a low rate of settlement fails. It shall promote early settlement on the intended settlement date through appropriate mechanisms.\n4.   For each securities settlement system it operates, a CSD shall put in place measures to encourage and incentivise the timely settlement of transactions by its participants. CSDs shall require participants to settle their transactions on the intended settlement date.\n5.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the measures to be taken by investment firms in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, the details of the procedures facilitating settlement referred to in paragraph 3 and the details of the measures to encourage and incentivise the timely settlement of transactions referred to in paragraph 4.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 7\nMeasures to address settlement fails\n1.   For each securities settlement system it operates, a CSD shall establish a system that monitors settlement fails of transactions in financial instruments referred to in Article 5(1). It shall provide regular reports to the competent authority and relevant authorities, as to the number and details of settlement fails and any other relevant information, including the measures envisaged by CSDs and their participants to improve settlement efficiency. Those reports shall be made public by CSDs in an aggregated and anonymised form on an annual basis. The competent authorities shall share with ESMA any relevant information on settlement fails.\n2.   For each securities settlement system it operates, a CSD shall establish procedures that facilitate settlement of transactions in financial instruments referred to in Article 5(1) that are not settled on the intended settlement date. These procedures shall provide for a penalty mechanism which will serve as an effective deterrent for participants that cause settlement fails.\nBefore establishing the procedures referred to in the first subparagraph, a CSD shall consult the relevant trading venues and CCPs in respect of which it provides settlement services.\nThe penalty mechanism referred to in the first subparagraph shall include cash penalties for participants that cause settlement fails (‘failing participants’). Cash penalties shall be calculated on a daily basis for each business day that a transaction fails to be settled after its intended settlement date until the end of a buy-in process referred to in paragraph 3, but no longer than the actual settlement day. The cash penalties shall not be configured as a revenue source for the CSD.\n3.   Without prejudice to the penalty mechanism referred to in paragraph 2 and the right to bilaterally cancel the transaction, where a failing participant does not deliver the financial instruments referred to in Article 5(1) to the receiving participant within 4 business days after the intended settlement date (‘extension period’) a buy-in process shall be initiated whereby those instruments shall be available for settlement and delivered to the receiving participant within an appropriate time-frame.\nWhere the transaction relates to a financial instrument traded on an SME growth market the extension period shall be 15 days unless the SME growth market decides to apply a shorter period.\n4.   The following exemptions from the requirement referred to in paragraph 3 shall apply:\n(a)\nbased on asset type and liquidity of the financial instruments concerned, the extension period may be increased from four business days up to a maximum of seven business days where a shorter extension period would affect the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets concerned;\n(b)\nfor operations composed of several transactions including securities repurchase or lending agreements, the buy-in process referred to in paragraph 3 shall not apply where the timeframe of those operations is sufficiently short and renders the buy-in process ineffective.\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 7, the exemptions referred to in paragraph 4 shall not apply in relation to transactions for shares where those transactions are cleared by a CCP.\n6.   Without prejudice to the penalty mechanism referred to in paragraph 2, where the price of the shares agreed at the time of the trade is higher than the price paid for the execution of the buy-in, the corresponding difference shall be paid to the receiving participant by the failing participant no later than on the second business day after the financial instruments have been delivered following the buy-in.\n7.   If the buy-in fails or is not possible, the receiving participant can choose to be paid cash compensation or to defer the execution of the buy-in to an appropriate later date (‘deferral period’). If the relevant financial instruments are not delivered to the receiving participant at the end of the deferral period, cash compensation shall be paid.\nCash compensation shall be paid to the receiving participant no later than on the second business day after the end of either the buy-in process referred to in paragraph 3 or the deferral period, where the deferral period was chosen.\n8.   The failing participant shall reimburse the entity that executes the buy-in for all amounts paid in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, including any execution fees resulting from the buy-in. Such fees shall be clearly disclosed to the participants.\n9.   CSDs, CCPs and trading venues shall establish procedures that enable them to suspend in consultation with their respective competent authorities, any participant that fails consistently and systematically to deliver the financial instruments referred to in Article 5(1) on the intended settlement date and to disclose to the public its identity only after giving that participant the opportunity to submit its observations and provided that the competent authorities of the CSDs, CCPs and trading venues, and of that participant have been duly informed. In addition to consulting before any suspension, CSDs, CCPs and trading venues shall notify, without delay, the respective competent authorities of the suspension of a participant. The competent authority shall immediately inform the relevant authorities of the suspension of a participant.\nPublic disclosure of suspensions shall not contain personal data within the meaning of point (a) of Article 2 of Directive 95/46/EC.\n10.   Paragraphs 2 to 9 shall apply to all transactions of the financial instruments referred to in Article 5(1) which are admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue or cleared by a CCP as follows:\n(a)\nfor transactions cleared by a CCP, the CCP shall be the entity that executes the buy-in according to paragraphs 3 to 8;\n(b)\nfor transactions not cleared by a CCP but executed on a trading venue, the trading venue shall include in its internal rules an obligation for its members and its participants to apply the measures referred to in paragraphs 3 to 8;\n(c)\nfor all transactions other than those referred to in points (a) and (b) of this subparagraph, CSDs shall include in their internal rules an obligation for their participants to be subject to the measures referred to in paragraphs 3 to 8.\nA CSD shall provide the necessary settlement information to CCPs and trading venues to enable them to fulfil their obligations under this paragraph.\nWithout prejudice to points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph, CSDs may monitor the execution of buy-ins referred to in those points with respect to multiple settlement instructions, on the same financial instruments and with the same date of expiry of the execution period, with the aim of minimising the number of buy-ins to be executed and thus the impact on the prices of the relevant financial instruments.\n11.   Paragraphs 2 to 9 shall not apply to failing participants which are CCPs.\n12.   Paragraphs 2 to 9 shall not apply if insolvency proceedings are opened against the failing participant.\n13.   This Article shall not apply where the principal venue for the trading of shares is located in a third country. The location of the principal venue for the trading of shares shall be determined in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012.\n14.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 67 to specify parameters for the calculation of a deterrent and proportionate level of the cash penalties referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 based on asset type and liquidity of the financial instrument and type of transaction that shall ensure a high degree of settlement discipline and the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets concerned.\n15.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a)\nthe details of the system monitoring settlement fails and the reports on settlement fails referred to in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nthe processes for collection and redistribution of cash penalties and any other possible proceeds from such penalties in accordance with paragraph 2;\n(c)\nthe details of operation of the appropriate buy-in process referred to in paragraphs 3 to 8, including appropriate time-frames to deliver the financial instrument following the buy-in process referred to in paragraph 3. Such time-frames shall be calibrated taking into account the asset type and liquidity of the financial instruments;\n(d)\nthe circumstances under which the extension period could be prolonged according to asset type and liquidity of the financial instruments, in accordance with the conditions referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4 taking into account the criteria for assessing liquidity under point (17) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014;\n(e)\ntype of operations and their specific time-frames referred to in point (b) of paragraph 4 that renders buy-in ineffective;\n(f)\na methodology for the calculation of the cash compensation referred to in paragraph 7;\n(g)\nthe conditions under which a participant is deemed consistently and systematically to fail to deliver the financial instruments as referred to in paragraph 9; and\n(h)\nthe necessary settlement information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 10.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 8\nEnforcement\n1.   The competent authority of the CSD that operates the securities settlement system, the relevant authority responsible for the oversight of the securities settlement system concerned as well as the competent authorities for the supervision of trading venues, investment firms and CCPs shall be competent for ensuring that Articles 6 and 7 are applied by the institutions subject to their supervision and for monitoring the penalties imposed. Where necessary, the respective competent authorities shall cooperate closely. Member States shall inform ESMA about the designated competent authorities that are part of the supervision structure at the national level.\n2.   In order to ensure consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the Union in relation to Articles 6 and 7 of this Regulation, ESMA may, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n3.   An infringement of the rules under this Title shall not affect the validity of a private contract on financial instruments or the possibility for the parties to enforce the provisions of a private contract on financial instruments.\nCHAPTER IV\nInternalised settlement\nArticle 9\nSettlement internalisers\n1.   Settlement internalisers shall report to the competent authorities of their place of establishment on a quarterly basis the aggregated volume and value of all securities transactions that they settle outside securities settlement systems.\nCompetent authorities shall without delay transmit the information received under the first subparagraph to ESMA and shall inform ESMA of any potential risk resulting from that settlement activity.\n2.   ESMA may, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards further specifying the content of such reporting.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n3.   ESMA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to establish standard forms, templates and procedures for the reporting and transmission of information referred to in paragraph 1.\nESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nTITLE III\nCENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORIES\nCHAPTER I\nAuthorisation and supervision of CSDs\nSection 1\nAuthorities responsible for authorisation and supervision of CSDs\nArticle 10\nCompetent authority\nWithout prejudice to the oversight by the members of the ESCB referred to in Article 12(1), a CSD shall be authorised and supervised by the competent authority of its home Member State.\nArticle 11\nDesignation of the competent authority\n1.   Each Member State shall designate the competent authority responsible for carrying out the duties under this Regulation for the authorisation and supervision of CSDs established in its territory and shall inform ESMA thereof.\nWhere a Member State designates more than one competent authority, it shall determine their respective roles and shall designate a single authority to be responsible for cooperation with other Member States’ competent authorities, the relevant authorities, ESMA, and EBA, where specifically referred to in this Regulation.\n2.   ESMA shall publish on its website a list of the competent authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 1.\n3.   The competent authorities shall have the supervisory and investigatory powers necessary for the exercise of their functions.\nArticle 12\nRelevant authorities\n1.

The application for authorisation shall be accompanied by all information necessary to enable the competent authority to satisfy itself that the applicant CSD has established, at the time of the authorisation, all the necessary arrangements to meet its obligations as laid down in this Regulation. The application for authorisation shall include a programme of operations setting out the types of business envisaged and the structural organisation of the CSD.\n3.   Within 30 working days from the receipt of the application, the competent authority shall assess whether the application is complete. If the application is not complete, the competent authority shall set a time limit by which the applicant CSD has to provide additional information. The competent authority shall inform the applicant CSD when the application is considered to be complete.\n4.   From the moment when the application is considered to be complete, the competent authority shall transmit all information included in the application to the relevant authorities and consult those authorities concerning the features of the securities settlement system operated by the applicant CSD. Each relevant authority may inform the competent authority of its views within 3 months of the receipt of the information by the relevant authority.\n5.   Where the applicant CSD intends to provide services referred to in point (2) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU in addition to the provision of non-banking-type ancillary services explicitly listed in Section B of the Annex, the competent authority shall transmit all information included in the application to the authority referred to in Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU and consult that authority on the ability of the applicant CSD to comply with the requirements of Directive 2014/65/EU and of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.\n6.   The competent authority shall, before granting authorisation to the applicant CSD, consult the competent authorities of the other Member State involved in the following cases:\n(a)\nthe CSD is a subsidiary of a CSD authorised in another Member State;\n(b)\nthe CSD is a subsidiary of the parent undertaking of a CSD authorised in another Member State;\n(c)\nthe CSD is controlled by the same natural or legal persons who control a different CSD authorised in another Member State.\n7.   The consultation referred to in paragraph 6 shall cover the following:\n(a)\nthe suitability of the shareholders and persons referred to in Article 27(6) and the reputation and experience of the persons who effectively direct the business of the CSD referred to in Article 27(1) and (4), where those shareholders and persons are common to the CSD and to a CSD authorised in another Member State;\n(b)\nwhether the relations referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 6 between the CSD authorised in another Member State and the applicant CSD do not affect the ability of the latter to comply with the requirements of this Regulation.\n8.   Within six months from the submission of a complete application, the competent authority shall inform the applicant CSD in writing with a fully reasoned decision whether the authorisation has been granted or refused.\n9.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the information that the applicant CSD is to provide to the competent authority in the application for authorisation.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n10.

The activities of the authorised CSD shall be limited to the provision of services covered by its authorisation or by notification in accordance with Article 19(8).\n2.   Securities settlement systems may be operated only by authorised CSDs, including central banks acting as CSDs.\n3.   An authorised CSD may have a participation only in a legal person whose activities are limited to the provision of services listed in Sections A and B of the Annex, unless such a participation is approved by its competent authority on the basis that it does not significantly increase the risk profile of the CSD.\n4.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria to be taken into account by the competent authorities to approve the participation of CSDs in legal persons other than those providing the services listed in Sections A and B of the Annex. Such criteria may include whether the services provided by that legal person are complementary to the services provided by a CSD, and the extent of the CSD’s exposure to liabilities arising from such participation.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 19\nExtension and outsourcing of activities and services\n1.   An authorised CSD shall submit an application for authorisation to the competent authority of its home Member State where it wishes to outsource a core service to a third party under Article 30 or extend its activities to one or more of the following:\n(a)\nadditional core services listed in Section A of the Annex, not covered by the initial authorisation;\n(b)\nancillary services permitted under, but not explicitly listed in Section B of the Annex, not covered by the initial authorisation;\n(c)\nthe operation of another securities settlement system;\n(d)\nthe settlement of all or part of the cash leg of its securities settlement system in the books of another settlement agent;\n(e)\nsetting up an interoperable link, including those with third-country CSDs.\n2.

CSDs established in the Union that intend to establish an interoperable link shall submit an application for authorisation as required under point (e) of paragraph 1, to their respective competent authorities. Those authorities shall consult each other regarding the approval of the CSD link. In the event of divergent decisions and if agreed by both competent authorities the matter may be referred to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n4.   The authorities referred to in paragraph 3 shall refuse to authorise a link only where such a CSD link would threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets or cause systemic risk.\n5.   Interoperable links of CSDs that outsource some of their services related to those interoperable links to a public entity in accordance with Article 30(5) and CSD links that are not referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1 shall not be subject to authorisation under that point but shall be notified to the CSDs’ competent and relevant authorities prior to their implementation by providing all relevant information that allows such authorities to assess compliance with the requirements provided in Article 48.\n6.   A CSD established and authorised in the Union may maintain or establish a link with a third-country CSD in accordance with the conditions and procedures provided in this Article. Where links are established with a third-country CSD the information provided by the requesting CSD shall allow the competent authority to evaluate whether such links fulfil the requirements provided in Article 48 or the requirements that are equivalent to those provided in Article 48.\n7.   The competent authority of the requesting CSD shall require that CSD to discontinue a CSD link that has been notified when such link does not fulfil the requirements provided for in Article 48 and thereby would threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets or cause systemic risk. Where a competent authority requires the CSD to discontinue a CSD link, it shall follow the procedure laid down in Article 20(2) and (3).\n8.   The additional ancillary services explicitly listed in Section B of the Annex shall not be subject to authorisation, but shall be notified to the competent authority prior to their provision.\nArticle 20\nWithdrawal of authorisation\n1.   Without prejudice to any remedial actions or measures under Title V, the competent authority of the home Member State shall withdraw the authorisation in any of the following circumstances, where the CSD:\n(a)\nhas not made use of the authorisation during 12 months, expressly renounces the authorisation or has provided no services or performed no activity during the preceding six months;\n(b)\nhas obtained the authorisation by making false statements or by any other unlawful means;\n(c)\nno longer complies with the conditions under which authorisation was granted and has not taken the remedial actions requested by the competent authority within a set time-frame;\n(d)\nhas seriously or systematically infringed the requirements laid down in this Regulation or, where applicable, in Directive 2014/65/EU or Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.\n2.   From the moment when it becomes aware of one of the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authority shall immediately consult the relevant authorities and, where applicable, the authority referred to in Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU on the necessity to withdraw the authorisation.\n3.   ESMA and any relevant authority and, where applicable, the authority referred to in Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU may, at any time, request that the competent authority of the home Member State examines whether the CSD still complies with the conditions under which the authorisation was granted.\n4.   The competent authority may limit the withdrawal of authorisation to a particular service, activity, or financial instrument.\n5.   A CSD shall establish, implement and maintain adequate procedures ensuring the timely and orderly settlement and transfer of the assets of clients and participants to another CSD in the event of a withdrawal of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 21\nCSD register\n1.   Decisions taken by competent authorities under Articles 16, 19 and 20 shall be immediately communicated to ESMA.\n2.

The register shall include branches operated by the CSD in other Member States, CSD links and the information required under Article 31 where Member States have made use of the possibility provided for in that Article. ESMA shall make the register available on its dedicated website and keep it up to date.\nSection 3\nSupervision of CSDs\nArticle 22\nReview and evaluation\n1.   The competent authority shall, at least on an annual basis, review the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by a CSD with respect to compliance with this Regulation and evaluate the risks to which the CSD is, or might be, exposed or which it creates for the smooth functioning of securities markets.\n2.   The competent authority shall require the CSD to submit to the competent authority an adequate recovery plan to ensure continuity of its critical operations.\n3.   The competent authority shall ensure that an adequate resolution plan is established and maintained for each CSD so as to ensure continuity of at least its core functions, having regard to the size, systemic importance, nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the CSD concerned and any relevant resolution plan established in accordance with Directive 2014/59/EU.\n4.   The competent authority shall establish the frequency and depth of the review and evaluation referred to in paragraph 1 having regard to the size, systemic importance, nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the CSD concerned. The review and evaluation shall be updated at least on an annual basis.\n5.   The competent authority shall subject the CSD to on-site inspections.\n6.   When performing the review and evaluation referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authority shall, at an early stage, consult the relevant authorities, in particular concerning the functioning of the securities settlement systems operated by the CSD and, where applicable, the authority referred to in Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU.\n7.   The competent authority shall regularly, and at least once a year, inform the relevant authorities and, where applicable, the authority referred to in Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU of the results, including any remedial actions or penalties, of the review and evaluation referred to in paragraph 1.\n8.   When performing the review and evaluation referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities responsible for supervising CSDs which maintain the types of relations referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 17(6) shall supply one another with all relevant information that is likely to facilitate their tasks.\n9.   The competent authority shall require a CSD that does not meet the requirements of this Regulation to take at an early stage the necessary actions or steps to address the situation.\n10.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:\n(a)\nthe information that the CSD is to provide to the competent authority for the purposes of the review and evaluation referred to in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nthe information that the competent authority is to supply to the relevant authorities, as set out in paragraph 7;\n(c)\nthe information that the competent authorities referred to in paragraph 8 are to supply one another.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n11.

An authorised CSD may provide services referred to in the Annex within the territory of the Union, including through setting up a branch, provided that those services are covered by the authorisation.\n2.   An authorised CSD that intends to provide the core services referred to in points 1 and 2 of Section A of the Annex in relation to financial instruments constituted under the law of another Member State referred to in Article 49(1) or to set up a branch in another Member State shall be subject to the procedure referred to in paragraphs 3 to 7.\n3.

Within three months from the receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 3, the competent authority of the home Member State shall communicate that information to the competent authority of the host Member State unless, by taking into account the provision of services envisaged, it has reasons to doubt the adequacy of the administrative structure or the financial situation of the CSD wishing to provide its services in the host Member State.\nThe competent authority of the host Member State shall without delay inform the relevant authorities of that Member State of any communication received under the first subparagraph.\n5.   Where the competent authority of the home Member State decides in accordance with paragraph 4 not to communicate all the information referred to in paragraph 3 to the competent authority of the host Member State it shall give reasons for its refusal to the CSD concerned within three months of receiving all the information and inform the competent authority of the host Member State of its decision in relation to point (a) of paragraph 6. Where information is shared in response to such a request the competent authority of the host Member State shall not issue the communication referred to in point (a) of paragraph 6.\n6.   The CSD may start providing the services referred to in paragraph 2 in the host Member State under the following conditions:\n(a)\non receipt of a communication from the competent authority in the host Member State acknowledging receipt by the latter of the communication referred to in paragraph 4 and, where relevant, approving the assessment referred to in point (e) of paragraph 3;\n(b)\nin the absence of any receipt of a communication, after three months from the date of transmission of the communication referred to in paragraph 4.\n7.   In the event of a change in any of the information communicated in accordance with paragraph 3, a CSD shall give written notice of that change to the competent authority of the home Member State at least one month before implementing the change. The competent authority of the host Member State shall also be informed of that change without delay by the competent authority of the home Member State.\nArticle 24\nCooperation between authorities of the home Member State and of the host Member State and peer review\n1.   Where a CSD authorised in one Member State has set up a branch in another Member State, the competent authority of the home Member State and the competent authority of the host Member State shall cooperate closely in the performance of their duties provided for in this Regulation, in particular when carrying out on-site inspections in that branch. The competent authority of the home Member State and of the host Member State may, in the exercise of their responsibilities, carry out on-site inspections in that branch after informing the competent authority of the host Member State or of the home Member State respectively.\n2.   The competent authority of the home Member State or of the host Member State may require CSDs which provide services in accordance with Article 23 to report to them periodically on their activities in that host Member State, including for the purpose of collecting statistics. The competent authority of the host Member State shall, on request from the competent authority of the home Member State, provide those periodic reports to the competent authority of the home Member State.\n3.   The competent authority of the home Member State of the CSD shall, on the request of the competent authority of the host Member State and without delay, communicate the identity of the issuers and participants in the securities settlement systems operated by the CSD which provides services in that host Member State and any other relevant information concerning the activities of that CSD in the host Member State.\n4.   Where, taking into account the situation of the securities markets in the host Member State, the activities of a CSD have become of substantial importance for the functioning of the securities markets and the protection of the investors in that host Member State, the competent authority of the home Member State and of the host Member State and the relevant authorities of the home Member State and of the host Member State shall establish cooperation arrangements for the supervision of the activities of that CSD in the host Member State.\nWhere a CSD has become of substantial importance for the functioning of the securities markets and the protection of the investors in more than one host Member State, the home Member State may decide that such cooperation arrangements are to include colleges of supervisors.\n5.   Where the competent authority of the host Member State has clear and demonstrable grounds for believing that a CSD providing services within its territory in accordance with Article 23 is in breach of the obligations arising from the provisions of this Regulation, it shall refer those findings to the competent authority of the home Member State and to ESMA.\nWhere, despite measures taken by the competent authority of the home Member State or because such measures prove inadequate, the CSD persists in acting in infringement of the obligations arising from the provisions of this Regulation, after informing the competent authority of the home Member State, the competent authority of the host Member State shall take all the appropriate measures needed in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation within the territory of the host Member State. ESMA shall be informed of such measures without delay.\nThe competent authority of the host Member State and of the home Member State may refer the matter to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n6.   Without prejudice to Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, ESMA shall, after consulting the members of the ESCB, organise and conduct, at least every three years, a peer review of the supervision of CSDs which make use of the freedom to provide services in another Member State in accordance with Article 23 or to participate in an interoperable link.\nIn the context of the peer review referred to in the first subparagraph ESMA shall, where appropriate, also request opinions or advice from the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group referred to in Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n7.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 67 concerning measures for establishing the criteria under which the operations of a CSD in a host Member State could be considered to be of substantial importance for the functioning of the securities markets and the protection of the investors in that host Member State.\n8.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft implementing technical standards to establish standard forms, templates and procedures for the cooperation referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 5.\nESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nSection 5\nRelations with third countries\nArticle 25\nThird countries\n1.   Third-country CSDs may provide services referred to in the Annex within the territory of the Union, including through setting up a branch.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a third-country CSD that intends to provide the core services referred to in points (1) and (2) of Section A of the Annex in relation to financial instruments constituted under the law of a Member State referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1) or to set up a branch in a Member State shall be subject to the procedure referred to in paragraphs 4 to 11 of this Article.\n3.   A CSD established and authorised in the Union may maintain or establish a link with a third-country CSD in accordance with Article 48.\n4.   After consulting the authorities referred to in paragraph 5, ESMA may recognise a third-country CSD that has applied for recognition to provide the services referred to in paragraph 2, where the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe Commission has adopted a decision in accordance with paragraph 9;\n(b)\nthe third-country CSD is subject to effective authorisation, supervision and oversight or, if the securities settlement system is operated by a central bank, oversight, ensuring full compliance with the prudential requirements applicable in that third country;\n(c)\ncooperation arrangements between ESMA and the responsible authorities in that third country (‘responsible third-country authorities’) have been established pursuant to paragraph 10;\n(d)\nwhere relevant, the third-country CSD takes the necessary measures to allow its users to comply with the relevant national law of the Member State in which the third-country CSD intends to provide CSD services, including the law referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), and the adequacy of those measures has been confirmed by the competent authorities of the Member State in which the third-country CSD intends to provide CSD services.\n5.   When assessing whether the conditions referred to in paragraph 4 are met, ESMA shall consult:\n(a)\nthe competent authorities of the Member States in which the third-country CSD intends to provide CSD services, in particular, on how the third-country CSD intends to comply with the requirement referred to in point (d) of paragraph 4;\n(b)\nthe relevant authorities;\n(c)\nthe responsible third-country authorities entrusted with the authorisation, supervision and oversight of CSDs.\n6.   The third-country CSD referred to in paragraph 2 shall submit its application for recognition to ESMA.\nThe applicant CSD shall provide ESMA with all information deemed to be necessary for its recognition. Within 30 working days from the receipt of the application, ESMA shall assess whether the application is complete. If the application is not complete, ESMA shall set a time limit by which the applicant CSD has to provide additional information.\nThe competent authorities of the Member States in which the third-country CSD intends to provide CSD services shall assess the compliance of the third-country CSD with the law referred to in point (d) of paragraph 4 and inform ESMA with a fully reasoned decision whether the compliance is met or not within three months from the receipt of all the necessary information from ESMA.\nThe recognition decision shall be based on the criteria laid down in paragraph 4.\nWithin six months from the submission of a complete application, ESMA shall inform the applicant CSD in writing with a fully reasoned decision whether the recognition has been granted or refused.\n7.   The competent authorities of the Member States in which the third-country CSD, duly recognised under paragraph 4, provides CSD services, in close cooperation with ESMA, may request the responsible third-country authorities to:\n(a)\nreport periodically on the third-country CSD’s activities in those host Member States, including for the purpose of collecting statistics;\n(b)\ncommunicate, within an appropriate time-frame, the identity of the issuers and participants in the securities settlement systems operated by the third-country CSD which provides services in that host Member State and any other relevant information concerning the activities of that third-country CSD in the host Member State.\n8.   ESMA shall, after consulting the authorities referred to in paragraph 5, review the recognition of the third-country CSD in the event of extensions by that CSD in the Union of its services under the procedure laid down in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.\nESMA shall withdraw the recognition of that CSD where the conditions laid down in paragraph 4 are no longer met, or in the circumstances referred to in Article 20.\n9.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts to determine that the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country ensure that CSDs authorised in that third country comply with legally binding requirements which are in effect equivalent to the requirements laid down in this Regulation, that those CSDs are subject to effective supervision, oversight and enforcement in that third country on an ongoing basis and that the legal framework of that third country provides for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of CSDs authorised under third-country legal regimes. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 68(2).\nIn making the determination referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission may also consider whether the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country reflect the internationally agreed CPSS-IOSCO standards, in so far as the latter do not conflict with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.\n10.   In accordance with Article 33(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, ESMA shall establish cooperation arrangements with the responsible third-country authorities whose legal and supervisory frameworks have been recognised as equivalent to this Regulation in accordance with paragraph 9. Such arrangements shall specify at least:\n(a)\nthe mechanism for the exchange of information between ESMA, the competent authorities of the host Member State and the third-country responsible authorities, including access to all information regarding the CSDs authorised in third countries that is requested by ESMA and in particular access to information in the cases referred to in paragraph 7;\n(b)\nthe mechanism for prompt notification of ESMA where a third-country responsible authority deems a CSD that it is supervising to infringe the conditions of its authorisation or of other applicable law;\n(c)\nthe procedures concerning the coordination of supervisory activities including, where appropriate, on-site inspections.\nWhere a cooperation agreement provides for transfers of personal data by a Member State, such transfers shall comply with the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC and where a cooperation agreement provides for transfers of personal data by ESMA, such transfers shall comply with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 45/2001.\n11.   Where a third-country CSD has been recognised, in accordance with paragraphs 4 to 8, it may provide services referred to in the Annex within the territory of the Union, including by setting up a branch.\n12.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the information that the applicant CSD is to provide to ESMA in its application for recognition under paragraph 6.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nCHAPTER II\nRequirements for CSDs\nSection 1\nOrganisational requirements\nArticle 26\nGeneral provisions\n1.

User committees may submit a non-binding opinion to the management body containing detailed reasons regarding the pricing structures of the CSD.\n5.   Without prejudice to the right of competent authorities to be duly informed, the members of the user committees shall be bound by confidentiality. Where the chairman of a user committee determines that a member has an actual or a potential conflict of interest in relation to a particular matter, that member shall not be allowed to vote on that matter.\n6.   A CSD shall promptly inform the competent authority and the user committee of any decision in which the management body decides not to follow the advice of the user committee. The user committee may inform the competent authority of any areas in which it considers that the advice of the user committee has not been followed.\nArticle 29\nRecord keeping\n1.

A CSD shall account separately for costs and revenues of the core services provided and shall disclose that information to the competent authority.\n7.   A CSD shall account for the cost and revenue of the ancillary services provided as a whole and shall disclose that information to the competent authority.\n8.   In order to ensure effective application of Union competition rules and enable the identification, inter alia, of cross-subsidisation of ancillary services by core services, a CSD shall maintain analytical accounting for its activities. Such analytical accounts shall at least separate the costs and revenues associated with each of its core services from those associated with ancillary services.\nArticle 35\nCommunication procedures with participants and other market infrastructures\nCSDs shall use in their communication procedures with participants of the securities settlement systems they operate, and with the market infrastructures they interface with international open communication procedures and standards for messaging and reference data in order to facilitate efficient recording, payment and settlement.\nSection 3\nRequirements for CSD services\nArticle 36\nGeneral provisions\nFor each securities settlement system it operates a CSD shall have appropriate rules and procedures, including robust accounting practices and controls, to help ensure the integrity of securities issues, and reduce and manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and settlement of transactions in securities.\nArticle 37\nIntegrity of the issue\n1.

Such reconciliation measures shall be conducted at least daily.\n2.   Where appropriate and if other entities are involved in the reconciliation process for a certain securities issue, such as the issuer, registrars, issuance agents, transfer agents, common depositories, other CSDs or other entities, the CSD and any such entities shall organise adequate cooperation and information exchange measures with each other so that the integrity of the issue is maintained.\n3.   Securities overdrafts, debit balances or securities creation shall not be allowed in a securities settlement system operated by a CSD.\n4.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the reconciliation measures a CSD is to take under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.\nESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nArticle 38\nProtection of securities of participants and those of their clients\n1.   For each securities settlement system it operates, a CSD shall keep records and accounts that shall enable it, at any time and without delay, to segregate in the accounts with the CSD, the securities of a participant from those of any other participant and, if applicable, from the CSD’s own assets.\n2.   A CSD shall keep records and accounts that enable any participant to segregate the securities of the participant from those of the participant’s clients.\n3.   A CSD shall keep records and accounts that enable any participant to hold in one securities account the securities that belong to different clients of that participant (‘omnibus client segregation’)\n4.   A CSD shall keep records and accounts that enable a participant to segregate the securities of any of the participant’s clients, if and as required by the participant (‘individual client segregation’).\n5.   A participant shall offer its clients at least the choice between omnibus client segregation and individual client segregation and inform them of the costs and risks associated with each option.\nHowever, a CSD and its participants shall provide individual clients segregation for citizens and residents of, and legal persons established in, a Member State where required under the national law of the Member State under which the securities are constituted as it stands at 17 September 2014. That obligation shall apply as long as the national law is not amended or repealed and its objectives are still valid.\n6.   CSDs and their participants shall publicly disclose the levels of protection and the costs associated with the different levels of segregation that they provide and shall offer those services on reasonable commercial terms. Details of the different levels of segregation shall include a description of the main legal implications of the respective levels of segregation offered, including information on the insolvency law applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.\n7.   A CSD shall not use for any purpose securities that do not belong to it. A CSD may however use securities of a participant where it has obtained that participant’s prior express consent. The CSD shall require its participants to obtain any necessary prior consent from their clients.\nArticle 39\nSettlement finality\n1.

Such sanctions and other measures shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\nMember States may decide not to lay down rules for administrative sanctions as referred to in the first subparagraph where the infringements referred to in that subparagraph are already subject to criminal sanctions in their national law by 18 September 2016. Where they so decide, Member States shall notify, in detail, to the Commission and to ESMA, the relevant parts of their criminal law.\nBy 18 September 2016, the Member States shall notify the rules referred to in the first subparagraph to the Commission and ESMA.

In the exercise of their sanctioning powers in the circumstances defined in Article 63 competent authorities shall cooperate closely to ensure that the administrative sanctions and other measures produce the results pursued by this Regulation and coordinate their actions in order to avoid any duplication or overlap when applying administrative sanctions and other measures to cross border cases in accordance with Article 14.\n4.   Where Member States have chosen, in accordance with paragraph 1 to lay down criminal sanctions for the infringements of the provisions referred to in Article 63, they shall ensure that appropriate measures are in place so that competent authorities have all the necessary powers to liaise with judicial authorities within their jurisdiction to receive specific information related to criminal investigations or proceedings commenced for possible infringements of this Regulation and provide the same to other competent authorities and ESMA to fulfil their obligation to cooperate with each other and ESMA for the purposes of this Regulation.\n5.

the European Union and on central securities depositories\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt aims to harmonise the timing and conduct of securities settlement in the European Union (EU) and the rules applicable to central securities depositories (CSDs)*.\nIt is designed to increase the safety and efficiency of the system, particularly for transactions within the EU.\nKEY POINTS\nThe regulation notably introduces the following elements. Shorter settlement periods, which should in general take place no later than the second business day after the trading occurs.An obligation to record in book-entry form* all transferable securities admitted to trading or traded on the trading venues.Strict organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements for CSDs.A settlement discipline regime to deal with settlement failures. CSDs must operate a cash penalties system and are subject to reporting requirements regarding settlement failures. Participants are subject to mandatory buy-ins.A passport system allowing authorised CSDs to provide their services across the EU, subject to certain passporting requirements.Increased prudential and supervisory requirements for CSDs and other institutions providing banking-type services that support securities settlement.\nEU Member States’ national authorities: authorise and supervise CSDs, and review and evaluate them on an annual basis at least;exchange information and cooperate with each other and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).\nCSDs must notably: have robust governance arrangements, a clear organisational structure, internal controls and sound administrative and accounting procedures;ensure senior management is of sufficiently good repute and experience;establish user committees for each securities settlement system they operate;maintain for at least 10 years all records of their services and activities;remain fully responsible for any work they outsource;display transparency by publicly disclosing the prices and fees involved in the core services they provide;have sufficient capital to be adequately protected against operational, legal, custody, investment and business risks;secure additional authorisations before providing any banking-type ancillary services.\nCSDs in a non-EU country may operate in the EU, including through an EU-based branch, provided they meet certain requirements.\nESMA maintains a publicly available register of each authorised CSD.\nMember States’ competent authorities have the power to apply appropriate administrative sanctions and other measures for an infringement.\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014\nTo have a clear and coherent legislative framework for trading and settlement, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 relies on many of the definitions and concepts of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II – see summary). Regulation (EU) 2016/1033 amends Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 to take into account the change in the date of application of MiFID II. To ensure legal certainty for the period between the previous date of application and the new date of application of MiFID II, Regulation (EU) 2016/1033 amends Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 clarifying that the rules set out in MiFID I (Directive 2004/39/EC) apply until the new date of entry into application of MiFID II.\nThe European Commission has also adopted several delegated acts supplementing Regulation (EU) No 909/2014: Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/389 regarding the parameters for the calculation of cash penalties for settlement fails and the operations of CSDs in host Member States;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/390 with regard to regulatory technical standards on certain prudential requirements for central securities depositories and designated credit institutions offering banking-type ancillary services;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/391 with regard to regulatory technical standards further specifying the content of the reporting on internalised settlements;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/392 with regard to regulatory technical standards on authorisation, supervisory and operational requirements for central securities depositories;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1229 with regard to regulatory technical standards on settlement discipline, which has in turn been amended by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1212 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/70.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\nBook-entry form requirements (Article 3(1)) apply from 1 January 2023 to transferable securities issued after that date and from 1 January 2025 to all transferable securities.\nThe regulation’s settlement date rules (Article 5(2)) have applied since 1 January 2015.\nThe settlement discipline regime (Articles 6(1) to (4) and 7(1) to (13)) applies from 1 February 2022.\nBACKGROUND\nTraditionally, CSDs have been regulated nationally.\nSettlement across borders presents higher risks and costs for investors than domestic operations. At the same time, this form of transaction is increasing.\nThe main objective of the regulation is to increase the safety and efficiency of securities settlement and settlement infrastructures in the EU. It does this by providing a common set of prudential, organisational and conduct of business standards for use across the EU, which should play a crucial role in financing the economy.\nFor further information, see: Central securities depositories (CSDs) (European Commission)Settlement (European Securities and Markets Authority).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCentral securities depositories. A legal person that operates a securities settlement system and provides at least services for the initial recording of securities in a book-entry system and/or for the provision and maintenance of securities accounts at top tier level.\nBook entry. Where the ownership of a security is recorded in electronic form rather than in certificate form.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories and amending Directives 98/26/EC and 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, pp. 1–72).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 have been incorporated in the original text.
