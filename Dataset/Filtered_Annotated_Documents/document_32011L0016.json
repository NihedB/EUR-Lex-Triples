{"celex_id": "32011L0016", "reference": "11.3.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 64/1\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2011/16/EU\nof 15 February 2011\non administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 113 and 115 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Member States’ need for mutual assistance in the field of taxation is growing rapidly in a globalised era. There is a tremendous development of the mobility of taxpayers, of the number of cross-border transactions and of the internationalisation of financial instruments, which makes it difficult for Member States to assess taxes due properly. This increasing difficulty affects the functioning of taxation systems and entails double taxation, which itself incites tax fraud and tax evasion, while the powers of controls remain at national level. It thus jeopardises the functioning of the internal market.\n(2)\nTherefore, a single Member State cannot manage its internal taxation system, especially as regards direct taxation, without receiving information from other Member States. In order to overcome the negative effects of this phenomenon, it is indispensable to develop new administrative cooperation between the Member States’ tax administrations. There is a need for instruments likely to create confidence between Member States, by setting up the same rules, obligations and rights for all Member States.\n(3)\nTherefore, a completely new approach should be taken by creating a new text to give Member States the power to efficiently cooperate at international level to overcome the negative effects of an ever-increasing globalisation on the internal market.\n(4)\nIn such a context, the existing Council Directive 77/799/EEC of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation and taxation of insurance premiums (3) no longer provides for appropriate measures. Its deep weaknesses have been looked into by the Ad hoc Council Working Party on Tax Fraud in its report of 22 May 2000 and more recently by the Commission Communication on Preventing and Combating Corporate and Financial Malpractice of 27 September 2004 and the Commission Communication concerning the need to develop a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud of 31 May 2006.\n(5)\nDirective 77/799/EEC, even with its later amendments, was designed in a different context to current internal market requirements and is no longer able to meet the new requirements of administrative cooperation.\n(6)\nDue to the number and the importance of adaptations to be made to Directive 77/799/EEC, a mere amendment thereof would not be sufficient to fulfil the objectives described above. Directive 77/799/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new legal instrument. That instrument should apply to direct taxes and indirect taxes that are not yet covered by other Union legislation. To this end, this new Directive is considered to be the proper instrument in terms of effective administrative cooperation.\n(7)\nThis Directive builds on the achievements of Directive 77/799/EEC but provides for clearer and more precise rules governing administrative cooperation between Member States where necessary, in order to establish, especially as regards the exchange of information, a wider scope of administrative cooperation between Member States. Clearer rules should also make it possible in particular to cover all legal and natural persons in the Union, taking into account the ever-increasing range of legal arrangements, including not only traditional arrangements such as trusts, foundations and investment funds, but any new instrument which may be set up by taxpayers in the Member States.\n(8)\nThere should be more direct contact between Member States’ local or national offices in charge of administrative cooperation, with communication between central liaison offices being the rule. The lack of direct contacts leads to inefficiency, under-use of the arrangements for administrative cooperation and delays in communication. Provision should therefore be made to bring about more direct contacts between services with a view to making cooperation more efficient and faster. The assignment of competences to the liaison departments should be deferred to the national provisions of each Member State.\n(9)\nMember States should exchange information concerning particular cases where requested by another Member State and should make the necessary enquiries to obtain such information. The standard of ‘foreseeable relevance’ is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that Member States are not at liberty to engage in ‘fishing expeditions’ or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. While Article 20 of this Directive contains procedural requirements, those provisions need to be interpreted liberally in order not to frustrate the effective exchange of information.\n(10)\nIt is recognised that the mandatory automatic exchange of information without preconditions is the most effective means of enhancing the correct assessment of taxes in cross-border situations and of fighting fraud. To that end, a step-by-step approach should therefore be followed starting with the automatic exchange of available information on five categories and reviewing the relevant provisions after a report by the Commission.\n(11)\nThe spontaneous exchange of information between Member States should also be strengthened and encouraged.\n(12)\nTime limits for the provision of information under this Directive should be laid down in order to ensure that the information exchange is timely and thus effective.\n(13)\nIt is important that officials of the tax administration of one Member State are allowed to be present in the territory of another Member State.\n(14)\nSince the tax situation of one or more persons liable to tax established in several Member States is often of common or complementary interest, it should be made possible for simultaneous controls to be carried out on such persons by two or more Member States, by mutual agreement and on a voluntary basis.\n(15)\nIn view of the legal requirement in certain Member States that a taxpayer be notified of decisions and instruments concerning his tax liability and of the ensuing difficulties for the tax authorities, including cases where the taxpayer has relocated to another Member State, it is desirable that, in such circumstances, the tax authorities should be able to call upon the cooperation of the competent authorities of the Member State to which the taxpayer has relocated.\n(16)\nFeedback on information sent will encourage administrative cooperation between Member States.\n(17)\nCollaboration between the Member States and the Commission is necessary for the permanent study of cooperation procedures and the sharing of experience and best practices in the fields considered.\n(18)\nIt is important for the efficiency of administrative cooperation that information and documents obtained under this Directive could, subject to the restrictions laid down in this Directive, be used by the Member State that received them also for other purposes. It is also important that Member States could transmit that information to a third country, under certain conditions.\n(19)\nThe situations in which a requested Member State may refuse to provide information should be clearly defined and limited, taking into account certain private interests which should be protected as well as the public interest.\n(20)\nHowever, a Member State should not refuse to transmit information because it has no domestic interest or because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.\n(21)\nThis Directive contains minimum rules and should therefore not affect Member States’ right to enter into wider cooperation with other Member States under their national legislation or in the framework of bilateral or multilateral agreements concluded with other Member States.\n(22)\nIt should also be made clear that where a Member State provides a wider cooperation to a third country than is provided for under this Directive, it should not refuse to provide such wider cooperation to other Member States wishing to enter into such mutual wider cooperation.\n(23)\nThe exchange of information should be made through standardised forms, formats and channels of communication.\n(24)\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of administrative cooperation should be made, especially on the basis of statistics.\n(25)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).\n(26)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making, Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Union, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(27)\nAll exchange of information referred to in this Directive is subject to the provisions implementing Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (5) and to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (6). However, it is appropriate to consider limitations of certain rights and obligations laid down by Directive 95/46/EC in order to safeguard the interests referred to in Article 13(1)(e) of that Directive. Such limitations are necessary and proportionate in view of the potential loss of revenue for Member States and the crucial importance of information covered by this Directive for the effectiveness of the fight against fraud.\n(28)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles which are recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(29)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely the efficient administrative cooperation between Member States to overcome the negative effects of the increasing globalisation on the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the uniformity and effectiveness required, be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.

Where the requested authority is not in possession of the requested information and is unable to respond to the request for information or refuses to do so on the grounds provided for in Article 17, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons thereof immediately and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.\nSECTION II\nMandatory automatic exchange of information\nArticle 8\nScope and conditions of mandatory automatic exchange of information\n1.   The competent authority of each Member State shall, by automatic exchange, communicate to the competent authority of any other Member State, information regarding taxable periods as from 1 January 2014 that is available concerning residents in that other Member State, on the following specific categories of income and capital as they are to be understood under the national legislation of the Member State which communicates the information:\n(a)\nincome from employment;\n(b)\ndirector’s fees;\n(c)\nlife insurance products not covered by other Union legal instruments on exchange of information and other similar measures;\n(d)\npensions;\n(e)\nownership of and income from immovable property.\n2.   Before 1 January 2014, Member States shall inform the Commission of the categories listed in paragraph 1 in respect of which they have information available. They shall inform the Commission of any subsequent changes thereto.\n3.   The competent authority of a Member State may indicate to the competent authority of any other Member State that it does not wish to receive information on the categories of income and capital referred to in paragraph 1, or that it does not wish to receive information on income or capital not exceeding a threshold amount. It shall also inform the Commission thereof. A Member State may be considered as not wishing to receive information in accordance with paragraph 1, if it does not inform the Commission of any single category in respect of which it has information available.\n4.   Before 1 July 2016, Member States shall provide the Commission on an annual basis with statistics on the volume of automatic exchanges and, to the extent possible, with information on the administrative and other relevant costs and benefits relating to exchanges that have taken place and any potential changes, for both tax administrations and third parties.\n5.   Before 1 July 2017, the Commission shall submit a report that provides an overview and an assessment of the statistics and information received, on issues such as the administrative and other relevant costs and benefits of the automatic exchange of information, as well as practical aspects linked thereto. If appropriate, the Commission shall present a proposal to the Council regarding the categories of income and capital and/or the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, including the condition that information concerning residents in other Member States has to be available.\nWhen examining a proposal put forward by the Commission, the Council shall assess further strengthening of the efficiency and functioning of the automatic exchange of information and raising the standard thereof, with the aim of providing that:\n(a)\nthe competent authority of each Member State shall, by automatic exchange, communicate to the competent authority of any other Member State, information regarding taxable periods as from 1 January 2017 concerning residents in that other Member State, on at least three of the specific categories of income and capital listed in paragraph 1, as they are to be understood under the national legislation of the Member State communicating the information; and\n(b)\nthe list of categories in paragraph 1 be extended to include dividends, capital gains and royalties.\n6.   The communication of information shall take place at least once a year, within six months following the end of the tax year of the Member State during which the information became available.\n7.   The Commission shall adopt the practical arrangements for the automatic exchange of information, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2), before the dates referred to in Article 29(1).\n8.   Where Member States agree on the automatic exchange of information for additional categories of income and capital in bilateral or multilateral agreements which they conclude with other Member States, they shall communicate those agreements to the Commission which shall make those agreements available to all the other Member States\nSECTION III\nSpontaneous exchange of information\nArticle 9\nScope and conditions of spontaneous exchange of information\n1.   The competent authority of each Member State shall communicate the information referred to in Article 1(1) to the competent authority of any other Member State concerned, in any of the following circumstances:\n(a)\nthe competent authority of one Member State has grounds for supposing that there may be a loss of tax in the other Member State;\n(b)\na person liable to tax obtains a reduction in, or an exemption from, tax in one Member State which would give rise to an increase in tax or to liability to tax in the other Member State;\n(c)\nbusiness dealings between a person liable to tax in one Member State and a person liable to tax in the other Member State are conducted through one or more countries in such a way that a saving in tax may result in one or the other Member State or in both;\n(d)\nthe competent authority of a Member State has grounds for supposing that a saving of tax may result from artificial transfers of profits within groups of enterprises;\n(e)\ninformation forwarded to one Member State by the competent authority of the other Member State has enabled information to be obtained which may be relevant in assessing liability to tax in the latter Member State.\n2.   The competent authorities of each Member State may communicate, by spontaneous exchange, to the competent authorities of the other Member States any information of which they are aware and which may be useful to the competent authorities of the other Member States.\nArticle 10\nTime limits\n1.   The competent authority to which information referred to in Article 9(1) becomes available, shall forward that information to the competent authority of any other Member State concerned as quickly as possible, and no later than one month after it becomes available.\n2.   The competent authority to which information is communicated pursuant to Article 9 shall confirm, if possible by electronic means, the receipt of the information to the competent authority which provided the information immediately and in any event no later than seven working days.\nCHAPTER III\nOTHER FORMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nSECTION I\nPresence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries\nArticle 11\nScope and conditions\n1.

In so far as this is permitted under the legislation of the requested Member State, the agreement referred to in paragraph 1 may provide that, where officials of the requesting authority are present during administrative enquiries, they may interview individuals and examine records.\nAny refusal by the person under investigation to respect the inspection measures of the officials of the requesting authority shall be treated by the requested authority as if that refusal was committed against officials of the latter authority.\n3.   Officials authorised by the requesting Member State present in another Member State in accordance with paragraph 1 shall at all times be able to produce written authority stating their identity and their official capacity.\nSECTION II\nSimultaneous controls\nArticle 12\nSimultaneous controls\n1.   Where two or more Member States agree to conduct simultaneous controls, in their own territory, of one or more persons of common or complementary interest to them, with a view to exchanging the information thus obtained, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall apply.\n2.   The competent authority in each Member State shall identify independently the persons for whom it intends to propose a simultaneous control. It shall notify the competent authority of the other Member States concerned of any cases for which it proposes a simultaneous control, giving reasons for its choice.\nIt shall specify the period of time during which those controls are to be conducted.\n3.   The competent authority of each Member State concerned shall decide whether it wishes to take part in simultaneous controls. It shall confirm its agreement or communicate its reasoned refusal to the authority that proposed a simultaneous control.\n4.   The competent authority of each Member State concerned shall appoint a representative with responsibility for supervising and coordinating the control operation.\nSECTION III\nAdministrative notification\nArticle 13\nRequest for notification\n1.   At the request of the competent authority of a Member State, the competent authority of another Member State shall, in accordance with the rules governing the notification of similar instruments in the requested Member State, notify the addressee of any instruments and decisions which emanate from the administrative authorities of the requesting Member State and concern the application in its territory of legislation on taxes covered by this Directive.\n2.   Requests for notification shall indicate the subject of the instrument or decision to be notified and shall specify the name and address of the addressee, together with any other information which may facilitate identification of the addressee.\n3.   The requested authority shall inform the requesting authority immediately of its response and, in particular, of the date of notification of the instrument or decision to the addressee.\n4.   The requesting authority shall only make a request for notification pursuant to this Article when it is unable to notify in accordance with the rules governing the notification of the instruments concerned in the requesting Member State, or where such notification would give rise to disproportionate difficulties. The competent authority of a Member State may notify any document by registered mail or electronically directly to a person within the territory of another Member State.\nSECTION IV\nFeedback\nArticle 14\nConditions\n1.   Where a competent authority provides information pursuant to Articles 5 or 9, it may request the competent authority which receives the information to send feedback thereon. If feedback is requested, the competent authority which received the information shall, without prejudice to the rules on tax secrecy and data protection applicable in its Member State, send feedback to the competent authority which provided the information as soon as possible and no later than three months after the outcome of the use of the requested information is known. The Commission shall determine the practical arrangements in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2).\n2.   Member States’ competent authorities shall send feedback on the automatic exchange of information to the other Member States concerned once a year, in accordance with practical arrangements agreed upon bilaterally.\nSECTION V\nSharing of best practices and experience\nArticle 15\nScope and conditions\n1.   Member States shall, together with the Commission, examine and evaluate administrative cooperation pursuant to this Directive and shall share their experience, with a view to improving such cooperation and, where appropriate, drawing up rules in the fields concerned.\n2.   Member States may, together with the Commission, produce guidelines on any aspect deemed necessary for sharing best practices and sharing experience.\nCHAPTER IV\nCONDITIONS GOVERNING ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nArticle 16\nDisclosure of information and documents\n1.   Information communicated between Member States in any form pursuant to this Directive shall be covered by the obligation of official secrecy and enjoy the protection extended to similar information under the national law of the Member State which received it. Such information may be used for the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the Member States concerning the taxes referred to in Article 2.\nSuch information may also be used for the assessment and enforcement of other taxes and duties covered by Article 2 of Council Directive 2010/24/EU of 16 March 2010 concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other measures (7), or for the assessment and enforcement of compulsory social security contributions.\nIn addition, it may be used in connection with judicial and administrative proceedings that may involve penalties, initiated as a result of infringements of tax law, without prejudice to the general rules and provisions governing the rights of defendants and witnesses in such proceedings.\n2.   With the permission of the competent authority of the Member State communicating information pursuant to this Directive, and only in so far as this is allowed under the legislation of the Member State of the competent authority receiving the information, information and documents received pursuant to this Directive may be used for other purposes than those referred to in paragraph 1. Such permission shall be granted if the information can be used for similar purposes in the Member State of the competent authority communicating the information.\n3.   Where a competent authority of a Member State considers that information which it has received from the competent authority of another Member State is likely to be useful for the purposes referred to in paragraph 1 to the competent authority of a third Member State, it may transmit that information to the latter competent authority, provided that transmission is in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in this Directive. It shall inform the competent authority of the Member State from which the information originates about its intention to share that information with a third Member State. The Member State of origin of the information may oppose such a sharing of information within 10 working days of receipt of the communication from the Member State wishing to share the information.\n4.   Permission to use information pursuant to paragraph 2, which has been transmitted pursuant to paragraph 3, may be granted only by the competent authority of the Member State from which the information originates.\n5.   Information, reports, statements and any other documents, or certified true copies or extracts thereof, obtained by the requested authority and communicated to the requesting authority in accordance with this Directive may be invoked as evidence by the competent bodies of the requesting Member State on the same basis as similar information, reports, statements and any other documents provided by an authority of that Member State.\nArticle 17\nLimits\n1.   A requested authority in one Member State shall provide a requesting authority in another Member State with the information referred to in Article 5 provided that the requesting authority has exhausted the usual sources of information which it could have used in the circumstances for obtaining the information requested, without running the risk of jeopardising the achievement of its objectives.\n2.   This Directive shall impose no obligation upon a requested Member State to carry out enquiries or to communicate information, if it would be contrary to its legislation to conduct such inquiries or to collect the information requested for its own purposes.\n3.   The competent authority of a requested Member State may decline to provide information where the requesting Member State is unable, for legal reasons, to provide similar information.\n4.   The provision of information may be refused where it would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process, or of information whose disclosure would be contrary to public policy.\n5.   The requested authority shall inform the requesting authority of the grounds for refusing a request for information.\nArticle 18\nObligations\n1.   If information is requested by a Member State in accordance with this Directive, the requested Member State shall use its measures aimed at gathering information to obtain the requested information, even though that Member State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. That obligation is without prejudice to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 17, the invocation of which shall in no case be construed as permitting a requested Member State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.\n2.

If the requested authority is unable to do so in time, it must inform the applicant authority immediately and, in any event, within 3 months of the request. The period may not exceed 6 months from the date of the request.\nMandatory automatic exchange of information\nAs of 2015, national authorities must, at least once a year and where available, automatically provide relevant Member States with information on the following categories of income and capital for residents in another Member State:\nemployment income\ndirectors’ fees\nlife insurance schemes\npensions\nownership of, and income from, immovable property.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2021/514 adds a new category of income derived from royalties to the above list. Before 1 January 2024, the Member States must inform the Commission of at least four categories for which their competent authorities will communicate, by automatic exchange, to the competent authority of any other Member State, information about residents of that other Member State. That information shall relate to taxable periods starting on or after 1 January 2025. As of 2017, national authorities must automatically provide relevant Member States with information on financial accounts held by residents in another Member State and on advance cross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements.\nAlso as of 2017, under Directive 2016/881/EU, national authorities must automatically provide relevant Member States with information on country-by-country reports — reports filed by multinational groups with operations in the EU. These include information for every tax jurisdiction in which the group does business on the amount of revenue, the profit before income tax, the income tax paid and accrued, the number of employees, the stated capital, the retained earnings and the tangible assets.\nAs of 2018, authorities must also be given access to beneficial ownership information collected pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/849, the EU’s anti-money laundering legislation (see summary).\nAs of 2020, national authorities must automatically provide Member States with information on reportable cross-border arrangements. Directive (EU) 2020/876 provided for an optional maximum extension of 6 months for the reporting deadlines for mandatory disclosure requirements for intermediaries and relevant taxpayers under the DAC6 — amending Directive (EU) 2018/822.\nNew reporting obligations for digital platforms\nAmending Directive (EU) 2021/514 also introduces new reporting obligations on operators of EU and non-EU digital platforms that allow certain sellers to be connected to other users in order to perform the following cross-border or domestic activities:\nproperty rentals\npersonal services\nsale of goods\nrental of any mode of transport.\nEU digital platforms that fulfil certain conditions in more than one Member State may elect to fulfil their reporting obligations in one such Member State. Non-EU digital platform operators that have a reporting obligation under DAC7 need to register in a Member State.\nNon-EU digital platform operators may be exempted from their DAC7 reporting obligations if they have to fulfil equivalent reporting obligations in a qualified non-Union jurisdiction — and that jurisdiction exchanges this equivalent information with all relevant EU Member States, in line with a specific agreement.\nA new Annex V contains due diligence procedures, reporting requirements and other rules for platform operators.\nSpontaneous information\nNational authorities must spontaneously provide information to their counterparts elsewhere in the EU as soon as possible, and no later than 1 month after it becomes available, if:\nthey believe there may be a tax loss in another Member State;\na person in one country receives a tax reduction or exemption that would increase their tax liability in another country;\nbusiness dealings between two people in different countries could lead to tax savings for either or for both;\nartificial profit transfers within groups of enterprises could lead to tax savings;\nthey receive information from another authority that could be relevant in assessing their tax liability.\nNational authorities:\nmay agree, in two or more Member States, to carry out simultaneous controls of taxpayers in whom they share an interest;\nthat were asked to provide information or that provided information spontaneously, may request feedback from those using it — and this should be provided within 3 months;\nthat receive information from a non-EU country may share this with their EU counterparts if they consider it to be of use — as long as they have advised the country in question of their intention to share it (and that country has the right to refuse).\nAll information shared between national authorities is subject to official secrecy.\nEvery year, national authorities must provide the Commission with data on the volume of automatic exchanges of information and, where possible, must assess the related costs and benefits.\nJoint audits\nAmending Directive (EU) 2021/514 includes a new section devoted to clarifying the legal framework and principles that apply to the conduct of joint audits between two or more Member States. Member States are required to adopt and publish these rules, by 31 December 2023, and to apply them from 1 January 2024 at the latest.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\nDirective 2011/16/EU has applied since 11 March 2011 and had to become law in the Member States on 1 January 2013.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2021/514 has to become law in the Member States by 31 December 2022 and its rules apply from 1 January 2023.\nBACKGROUND\nFaced with the increasing mobility of taxpayers, more cross-border transactions and the arrival of new financial instruments, national tax administrations must increase administrative cooperation to ensure tax compliance and reduce tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax fraud.\nFor further information, see: Administrative cooperation in (direct) taxation in the EU (European Commission)\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC (OJ L 64, 11.3.2011, pp. 1–12).\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2011/16/EU have been incorporated into the original document.
