GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS\n1.\nDesignating authorities shall only designate legally identifiable entities as conformity assessment bodies.\n2.\nDesignating authorities shall only designate conformity assessment bodies able to demonstrate that they understand, have experience relevant to, and are competent to apply the conformity assessment requirements and procedures of the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions of the other Party for which they are designated.\n3.\nDemonstration of technical competence shall be based on:\n—\ntechnological knowledge of the relevant products, processes or services,\n—\nunderstanding of the technical standards and the general risk protection requirements for which designation is sought,\n—\nexperience relevant to the applicable legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions,\n—\nthe physical capability to perform the relevant conformity assessment activity,\n—\nan adequate management of the conformity assessment activities concerned, and\n—\nany other circumstance necessary to give assurance that the conformity assessment activity will be adequately performed on a continuous basis.\n4.\nThe technical competence criteria shall be based on internationally-accepted documents supplemented by specific interpretative documents developed as appropriate from time to time.\n5.\nThe Parties shall encourage harmonisation of designation and conformity assessment procedures through cooperation between designating authorities and conformity assessment bodies by means of coordination meetings, participation in mutual recognition arrangements, and working group meetings. Where accreditation bodies participate in the designation process they should be encouraged to participate in mutual recognition arrangements.\nB.   SYSTEM TO DETERMINE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT BODIES' COMPETENCE\n6.\nThe designating authorities may apply the following processes to determine the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. If necessary, a Party will indicate to the designating authority the possible ways to demonstrate competence.\n(a)\nAccreditation\nAccreditation shall constitute a presumption of technical competence in relation to the requirements of the other Party when:\n(i)\nthe accreditation process is conducted in conformance with the relevant international documentation (EN 45000 series or ISO/IEC guides); and either\n(ii)\nthe accreditation body participates in mutual recognition arrangements where they are subject to peer evaluation which involves evaluation by individuals with recognised expertise in the field of the work being evaluated, of the competence of accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies accredited by them; or\n(iii)\nthe accreditation bodies, operating under the authority of the designating authority, take part in accordance with procedures to be agreed in comparison programmes and exchanges of technical experience in order to ensure the continued confidence in the technical competence of the accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies. Such programmes may include joint assessments, special cooperation programmes or peer evaluation.\nWhen a conformity assessment body is only accredited to evaluate a product, process or service for compliance with particular technical specifications, designation shall be limited to those technical specifications.\nWhen a conformity assessment body seeks designation to evaluate a particular product, process or service for compliance with essential requirements, the accreditation process shall incorporate elements which will permit assessment of the capability (technological knowledge and understanding of the generally stated risk protection requirements of the product, process or service or their use) of the conformity assessment body to evaluate compliance with those essential requirements.\n(b)\nOther means\nWhen appropriate accreditation is not available or when special circumstances apply, the designating authorities shall require the conformity assessment bodies to demonstrate their competence through other means such as:\n—\nparticipation in regional/international mutual recognition arrangements or certification systems,\n—\nregular peer evaluations,\n—\nproficiency testing, and\n—\ncomparisons between conformity assessment bodies.\nC.   EVALUATION OF THE DESIGNATION SYSTEM\n7.\nOnce the designation systems to evaluate the competence of conformity assessment bodies have been defined by each Party, the other Party may, in consultation with the designating authorities, check that the systems give sufficient assurance that the designation of the conformity assessment bodies satisfies its requirements.\nD.   FORMAL DESIGNATION\n8.\nDesignating authorities shall consult the conformity assessment bodies within their jurisdiction in order to determine their willingness to be designated under the terms of this Agreement. Such consultation should include those conformity assessment bodies who do not operate under the respective legislative, regulatory and administrative requirements of their own Party but which may, nevertheless, be interested and capable of working to the legislative, regulatory and administrative requirements of the other Party.\n9.\nDesignating authorities shall inform their Party's representatives on the Joint Committee, established under Article 12 of this Agreement, of the conformity assessment bodies to be included in or withdrawn from Section II of the Sectoral Annexes. Designation, suspension or withdrawal of designation of conformity assessment bodies shall take place in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee.\n10.\nWhen advising their Party's representative on the Joint Committee established under this Agreement, of the conformity assessment bodies to be included in the Sectoral Annexes, the designating authority shall provide the following details in respect of each conformity assessment body:\n(a)\nthe name;\n(b)\nthe postal address;\n(c)\nthe fax number;\n(d)\nthe range of products, processes, standards or services it is authorised to assess;\n(e)\nthe conformity assessment procedures it is authorised to carry out, and\n(f)\nthe designation procedure used to determine competence.\nE.   MONITORING\n11.\nDesignating authorities shall maintain, or cause to maintain, ongoing surveillance over designated conformity assessment bodies by means of regular audit or assessment. The frequency and nature of such activities shall be consistent with international best practices or as agreed by the Joint Committee.\n12.\nDesignating authorities shall require designated conformity assessment bodies to participate in proficiency testing or other appropriate comparison exercises where such exercises are technically possible within reasonable cost.\n13.\nDesignating authorities shall consult as necessary with their counterparts to ensure the maintenance of confidence in conformity assessment processes and procedures. This consultation may include joint participation in audits related to conformity assessment activities or other assessments of designated conformity assessment bodies, where such participation is appropriate and technically possible within reasonable cost.\n14.\nDesignating authorities shall consult, as necessary, with the relevant regulatory authorities of the other Party to ensure that all regulatory requirements are identified and are satisfactorily addressed.\nSECTORAL ANNEX ON MEDICINAL PRODUCTS GMP INSPECTION AND BATCH CERTIFICATION TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY-AUSTRALIA AGREEMENT ON MUTUAL RECOGNITION IN RELATION TO CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT, CERTIFICATES AND MARKINGS\nSCOPE AND COVERAGE\n1.\nThe provisions of this Sectoral Annex cover all medicinal products which are industrially manufactured in Australia and the European Community, and to which Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements apply.\nFor medicinal products covered by this Sectoral Annex, each Party shall recognise the conclusions of inspections of manufacturers carried out by the relevant inspection services of the other Party and the relevant manufacturing authorisations granted by the competent authorities of the other Party.\nIn addition, the manufacturer's certification of the conformity of each batch to its specifications shall be recognised by the other Party without re-control at import.\n‘Medicinal products’ means all products regulated by the pharmaceutical legislation in the European Community and Australia as listed in the Appendix to this Annex. The definition of medicinal products includes all human and veterinary products, such as chemical and biological pharmaceuticals, immunologicals, radiopharmaceuticals, stable medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma, pre-mixes for the preparation of veterinary medicated feedingstuffs, and, where appropriate, vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies and homeopathic medicinal products.\n‘GMP’ is that part of quality assurance which ensures that products are consistently produced and controlled during manufacture to the quality standards appropriate to their intended use and as required by the marketing authorisation granted by the importing Party. For the purpose of this Sectoral Annex it includes the system whereby the manufacturer receives the specification of the product and/or process from the marketing authorisation holder or applicant and ensures that the medicinal product is made in compliance with this specification (equivalent to qualified person certification in the European Community).\n2.\nWith respect to medicinal products covered by the legislation of one Party but not the other, the manufacturing company can request that, for the purpose of this Agreement, an inspection be made by the locally competent inspection service. This provision will apply inter alia to the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediate products and products intended for use in clinical trials, as well as agreed pre-marketing inspections. Operational arrangements are detailed under Section III, item 3b.\nCertification of manufacturers\n3.\nAt the request of an exporter, importer or the competent authority of the other Party, the authorities responsible for granting manufacturing authorisations and for supervision of manufacturers of medicinal products shall certify that the manufacturer:\n—\nis appropriately authorised to manufacture the relevant medicinal product or to carry out the relevant specified manufacturing operation,\n—\nis regularly inspected by the authorities, and\n—\ncomplies with the national GMP requirements recognised as equivalent by the two Parties, and which are listed in Appendix 1 to this Sectoral Annex. In case different GMP requirements are used as a reference (in line with the provisions in Section III, item 3b), this is to be mentioned in the certificate.\nThe certificates shall also identify the site(s) of manufacture (and contract testing laboratories, if any). The format of certificate is attached as Appendix 2; it may be modified by the Joint Committee, as established in Article 12 of the Agreement.\nCertificates shall be issued expeditiously, and the time taken should not exceed 30 calendar days. In exceptional cases, such as when a new inspection has to be carried out, this period may be extended to 60 days.\nBatch certification\n4.\nEach batch exported shall be accompanied by a batch certificate prepared by the manufacturer (self-certification) after a full qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of all the active constituents and all the other tests or checks necessary to ensure the quality of the product in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation. This certificate shall attest that the batch meets its specifications and shall be kept by the importer of the batch. It will be made available upon request of the competent authority.\nWhen issuing a certificate, the manufacturer shall take account of the provisions of the current WHO certification scheme on the quality of pharmaceutical products moving in international commerce. The certificate will detail the agreed specifications of the product, the reference of the analytical methods and the analytical results. It shall contain a statement that the batch processing and packaging records were reviewed and found to be in conformity with GMP. The batch certificate shall be signed by the person responsible for releasing the batch for sale or supply, i.e. in the European Community the ‘qualified person’ referred to in Article 21 of Second Council Directive 75/319/EEC of 20 May 1975 on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to proprietary medicinal products. In Australia, the responsible persons are for manufacturing quality control as specified in the Therapeutic Goods Regulation 19(b) under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.\nSECTION I\nLEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS\nSubject to Section III ‘Operational provisions’, general GMP inspections shall be carried out in accordance with the GMP requirements of the exporting Party. The legislative, regulatory and administrative requirements are listed in Appendix 1.\nHowever, the reference quality requirements of products to be exported, including their manufacturing method and product specifications, shall be those of the relevant product marketing authorisation granted by the importing Party.\nSECTION II\nOFFICIAL INSPECTION SERVICES\nFOR AUSTRALIA:\nTherapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)\nDepartment of Health and Family Services\nPO Box 100\nWoden ACT 2606\nAustralia\nTel. 61-6-232 8632\nFax 61-6-232 8659\nFOR THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY:\nBELGIUM\nInspection générale de la pharmacie\nAlgemene Farmaceutische Inspectie\nDENMARK\nLægemiddelstyrelsen\nGERMANY\nBundesministeriumfür Gesundheit\nGREECE\nΕθνικός Οργανισμός Φαρμάκου\nMinistry of Health and Welfare\nNational Drug Organisation (EOF)\nSPAIN\nFor medicinal products for human use:\nMinisterio de Sanidad y Consumo\nSubdirección General de Control Farmacéutico\nFor medicinal products for veterinary use:\nMinisterio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación (MAPA)\nDirección General de la Producción Agraria\nFRANCE\nFor medicinal products for human use:\nAgence du médicament\nFor veterinary medicinal products:\nCNEVA, Agence nationale du médicament vétérinaire, unité inspections\nFor cosmetics:\nMinistère de l'emploi et de la solidarité\nDirection générale de la santé\nSous direction pharmacie\nIRELAND\nIrish Medicines Board\nITALY\nFor medicinal products for human use:\nMinistero della Sanità\nDipartimento Farmaci e Farmacovigilanza\nFor medicinal products for veterinary use:\nMinistero della Sanità\nDipartimento alimenti e nutrizione e sanità pubblica veterinaria — Div.

Transmission of inspection reports\nUpon reasoned request, the relevant inspection services shall forward a copy of the last inspection report of the manufacturing site or control site, in the case where analytical operations are contracted out. The request may concern a ‘full inspection report’ or a ‘detailed report’ (see item 2 below). Each Party shall deal with these inspection reports with the degree of confidentiality requested by the Party of origin.\nIf the manufacturing operations of the medicinal product in question have not been inspected recently, i.e. when the last inspection dates back to more than two years or a particular need to inspect has been identified, a specific and detailed inspection may be requested. Parties shall ensure that inspection reports are forwarded in no more than 30 calendar days, this period being extended to 60 days should a new inspection be carried out.\n2.   Inspection reports\nA ‘full inspection report’ comprises a Site Master File (compiled by the manufacturer or by the inspectorate) and a narrative report by the inspectorate. A ‘detailed report’ responds to specific queries about a firm by the other Party.\n3.   Reference GMP\n(a)\nManufacturers shall be inspected in accordance with the applicable GMP of the exporting country (see Appendix 1).\n(b)\nWith respect to medicinal products covered by the pharmaceutical legislation of the importing Party but not the exporting one, the locally competent inspection service willing to carry out an inspection of the relevant manufacturing operations shall inspect in accordance with its own GMP or, in the absence of specific GMP requirements, in accordance with the applicable GMP of the importing country. This will also be the case when the locally applicable GMP are not considered equivalent, in terms of quality assurance of the finished product, to the GMP of the importing Party.\nEquivalence of GMP requirements for specific products or classes of products (e.g. investigational medicinal products, starting materials) shall be determined according to a procedure established by the Joint Committee.\n4.   Nature of inspections\n(a)\nInspections shall routinely assess the compliance of the manufacturer with GMP. These are called general GMP inspections (also regular, periodic, or routine inspections).\n(b)\n‘Product- or process-oriented’ inspections (which may be ‘pre-marketing’ inspections as relevant) focus on the manufacture of one or one series of product(s) or process(es) and include an assessment of the validation of and compliance with specific process or control aspects as described in the marketing authorisation. Where necessary, relevant product information (the quality dossier of an application/authorisation dossier) shall be provided in confidence to the inspectorate.\n5.   Inspection/establishment fees\nThe regime of inspection/establishment fees is determined by the manufacturer's location. Inspection/establishment fees will not be charged to manufacturers located on the territory of the other Party for products covered by this Agreement, except as provided for in paragraph 6 below.\n6.   Safeguard clause for inspections\nEach Party reserves the right to conduct its own inspection for reasons identified to the other Party. Such inspections are to be notified in advance to the other Party, which has the option of joining the inspection. Recourse to this safeguard clause should be an exception. Should such an inspection take place, inspection costs may be recovered.\n7.   Exchange of information between authorities and approximation of quality requirements\nIn accordance with the general provisions of the Agreement, the Parties shall exchange any information necessary for the mutual recognition of inspections.\nIn addition, the relevant authorities in Australia and in the European Community shall keep each other informed of any new technical guidance or inspection procedure. Each Party shall consult the other before their adoption and will endeavour to proceed towards their approximation.\n8.   Official batch release\nThe official batch release procedure is an additional verification of the safety and efficacy of immunological medicinal products (vaccines) and blood derivatives, carried out by the competent authorities before the distribution of each batch of product. This Agreement does not encompass this mutual recognition of official batch releases. However, when an official batch release procedure applies, the manufacturer shall provide, at the request of the importing Party, the official batch release certificate if the batch in question has been tested by the control authorities of the exporting Party.\nFor the European Community, the official batch release procedure for medicinal products for human use is specified in document ‘Administrative EC Batch Release Procedure III/3859/92’ and different specific batch release procedures. For Australia, the official batch release procedure is specified in document ‘WHO Technical Report Series, No 822, 1992’.\n9.   Inspectors training\nIn accordance with the general provisions of the Agreement, training sessions for inspectors, organised by the authorities, shall be accessible to inspectors of the other Party. The Parties to the Agreement will keep each other informed on these sessions.\n10.   Joint inspections\nIn accordance with the general provisions of the Agreement, and by mutual agreement between the Parties, joint inspections may be authorised. These inspections are intended to develop common understanding and interpretation of practice and requirements. The setting up of these inspections and their form shall be agreed through procedures approved by the Joint Committee.\n11.   Alert system\nContact points will be agreed between the Parties to permit competent authorities and manufacturers to inform the authorities of the other Party with the appropriate speed in case of quality defect, batch recalls, counterfeiting and other problems concerning quality, which could necessitate additional controls or suspension of the distribution of the batch. A detailed alert procedure will be agreed.\nThe Parties shall ensure that any suspension or withdrawal (total or partial) of a manufacturing authorisation, based on non-compliance with GMP and which could affect the protection of public health, is communicated to each other with the appropriate degree of urgency.\n12.

Divergence of views\nBoth Parties shall use their best endeavours to resolve any divergence of views concerning inter alia compliance of manufacturers and conclusions of inspection reports. Unresolved divergences of view will be referred to the Joint Committee.\nSECTION IV\nTRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS\nThe Parties note that the current GMP requirements for veterinary medicinal products in Australia are not equivalent to those that apply in the European Community. Therefore, Australian veterinary medicinal products manufacturers will be inspected by Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on behalf of the veterinary National Registration Authority, according to the TGA reference GMP and relevant additional EC GMP for veterinary medicinal products.\nDuring a two-year transitional period, TGA inspection reports will be routinely sent to the importing Party, which may accept them or decide to carry out an inspection itself. If accepted, the European Community will recognise Australian manufacturers' certifications of batch conformity.\nTwo years after the entry into force of the Agreement, the European Community shall, subject to satisfactory verification of Australia's GMP inspection programme, recognise the conclusions of inspections carried out by the TGA and Australian manufacturers' certifications of batch conformity.\nShould the National Registration Authority (NRA) begin to carry out inspections itself, inspection reports will also be routinely transmitted to the importing Party until there has been a satisfactory verification of the NRA GMP inspection programme.\nAppendix 1\nList of applicable legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions\nFor the European Community:\nCouncil Directive
