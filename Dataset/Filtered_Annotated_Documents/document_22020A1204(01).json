This Agreement applies to the cooperation on, and protection of, geographical indications of products which originate in the territories of the Parties.\n2.   The Parties agree to consider extending the scope of geographical indications covered by this Agreement after its entry into force to other product classes of geographical indications not covered by the scope of the legislation referred to in Article 2, and in particular handicrafts, by taking into account the legislative development of the Parties.\nFor the purposes referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the Parties have included in Annex VII names identifying products originating and protected in their territory that, upon enlargement of the scope of protection of this Agreement, shall be given priority for protection in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 3 of this Agreement.\nThe Parties shall review the progress made in enlarging the scope of protection of this Agreement within two years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement and conduct a review every two years thereafter.\nArticle 2\nEstablished geographical indications\n1.   The Parties conclude that their respective legislation listed in Annex I to this Agreement establishes the essential elements for the procedure for registration and protection of geographical indications as defined by Article 22(1) of the TRIPS Agreement.\nThe Parties agree that the essential elements referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph are the following:\n(a)\none or more registers listing geographical indications protected in the territory concerned;\n(b)\nan administrative process verifying that a geographical indication identifies a good as originating in a territory, region or locality of one of the Parties, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin;\n(c)\na requirement that a registered name shall correspond to a specific product or products for which a product specification is laid down which can only be amended by due administrative process;\n(d)\ncontrol provisions applying to production;\n(e)\nenforcement of the protection of registered names by appropriate administrative action by the public authorities;\n(f)\na right for any producer established in the area who submits to the system of controls to market products labelled with the protected name provided that the producer complies with the product specifications;\n(g)\nan opposition procedure that allows the legitimate interests of prior users of names, whether those names are protected as a form of intellectual property or not, to be taken into account.\n2.   Having examined the technical specifications set out in the form laid down in Annex II for the geographical indications of the People's Republic of China listed in Annex III, which have been registered by the People's Republic of China under its legislation listed in Annex I, the European Union undertakes to protect those geographical indications according to a level of protection no less than that laid down in this Agreement.\n3.   Having examined the technical specifications set out in the form laid down in Annex II for the geographical indications of the European Union listed in Annex IV, which have been registered by the European Union under its legislation listed in Annex I, the People's Republic of China undertakes to protect those geographical indications according to a level of protection no less than that laid down in this Agreement.\n4.   This Article applies without prejudice to any previous commitments of the Parties derived from the application of Article 3 of the TRIPS Agreement regarding National Treatment.\nArticle 3\nAddition of geographical indications\n1.   As regards geographical indications listed in Annex V or VI, the Parties understand that they will be processed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement during the first four years after the entry into force of this Agreement (1).\n2.   Additions to the geographical indications listed in Annexes III and IV shall, after having examined their technical specifications set out in the form laid down in Annex II, be subject to the relevant procedures referred to in Article 10(3) (2).\nArticle 4\nScope of protection of geographical indications (3)\n1.   In respect of the geographical indications listed in Annex III or IV, including geographical indications added thereto pursuant to Article 3 of this Agreement, each Party shall protect them against (4):\n(a)\nthe use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than the true place of origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good;\n(b)\nany use of a geographical indication identifying an identical or similar product not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question, even where the true origin of the goods is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation, transcription (5) or transliteration, or accompanied by expressions such as \"kind\", \"type\", \"style\", \"imitation\" or the like;\n(c)\nany use of a geographical indication identifying an identical or similar product not compliant with the product specification of the protected name.\n2.   In the case of wholly or partially homonymous geographical indications, protection shall be accorded to each indication. However, a geographical indication which, although literally true as to the territory, region or locality in which the goods originate, falsely represents to the public that the goods originate in another territory shall not be protected.\nEach Party shall, as far as possible, consult the other Party prior to determining the practical conditions under which the homonymous indications concerned will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled.\n3.   As regards the addition of geographical indications pursuant to Article 3, a Party shall not be required to protect as a geographical indication a name that conflicts with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\n4.   Where a Party, in the context of negotiations with a third country, proposes to protect a geographical indication of that third country, and the name is homonymous with a geographical indication of the other Party protected under this Agreement, the latter shall be informed and be given the opportunity to comment before the name becomes protected.\n5.   Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige a Party to protect a geographical indication of the other Party which is not, or ceases to be, protected in its country of origin, or which has fallen into disuse in that country. Each Party shall notify the other Party if one of its geographical indications ceases to be protected in its country of origin or has fallen into disuse in that country.\n6.   This Agreement shall in no way prejudice the right of any person to use, in the course of trade, that person's name or the name of that person's predecessor in business, except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.\nArticle 5\nRight of use of geographical indications\n1.   A geographical indication protected under this Agreement may be used on any legitimate product conforming to the technical specification of that geographical indication and following all the requirements of the relevant legislation of the Party in which the geographical indication originates as listed in Annex I.\n2.   Once a geographical indication is protected under this Agreement, the products covered by that geographical indication may bear the official symbols of the geographical indication of the other Party in the territory of that Party, in accordance with the relevant legislation listed in Annex I.\nGeographical indications listed in Annex III shall be incorporated in the relevant European Union register with effect from the date of entry into force of this Agreement (6). The products covered by a geographical indication protected under this Agreement and listed in Annex III, including those geographical indications entered into Annex III in accordance with Article 3 of this Agreement, may bear the European symbol corresponding to a Protected Designation of Origin or to a Protected Geographical Indication in the territory of the European Union. Following a case-by-case assessment, the European Union shall decide on entering the geographical indications listed in Annex III, including those geographical indications entered into Annex III in accordance with Article 3 of this Agreement, in the relevant European Union register either as a Protected Designation of Origin or as a Protected Geographical Indication. Those geographical indications shall be incorporated in the register with effect from the date of application of such decision.\nFor the geographical indications listed in Annex IV, the symbols corresponding to Geographical Indication Products as laid down by the legislation of the People's Republic of China may be used.\nOnce a geographical indication is protected under this Agreement, the products covered by that geographical indication may bear the official symbols in accordance with the legislation of the originating Party listed in Annex I, in the territory of the other Party, provided that general labelling requirements of the latter are met.\nThis paragraph shall be without prejudice to the right of either Party to adopt or maintain a system for authorising the use of official symbols for geographical indications originating in its territory.\n3.   Once a geographical indication is protected under this Agreement, the use of such protected name by any user in the territory of the other Party shall not be subject to any administrative approval of users, or further administrative charges. The right holder or the control body of a geographical indication is encouraged to provide the list of users to the competent authorities of the other Party to facilitate enforcement under this Agreement.\nArticle 6\nRelationship with trade marks\n1.   The Parties shall, ex officio or at the request of an interested party, refuse or invalidate the registration of a trade mark which consists of (7) a geographical indication or its translation or transcription, with respect to identical or similar products not having the origin indicated by that geographical indication, in accordance with their respective rules, provided that the application for registration of the trade mark has been submitted after the date of protection for the geographical indications listed in Annex III or IV, or after the date of application for protection for the geographical indications referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement, in the territory concerned.\n2.   The Parties shall also, at the request of an interested party, refuse or invalidate the registration of a trade mark which indicates that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than the true place of origin with respect to identical or similar products, provided that the application for registration of the trade mark has been submitted after the date of protection for the geographical indications listed in Annex III or IV, or after the date of application for protection for the geographical indications referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement, in the territory concerned (8).\n3.   Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige a Party to protect a geographical indication of the other Party under this Agreement where, in the light of a reputed or well-known trade mark, the protection would be liable to mislead the consumers as to the true identity of the product.\n4.   The protection provided to the geographical indications listed in Annexes III and IV, under this Agreement, is without prejudice to the continued use and renewal of a trade mark which, in good faith, has been applied for, registered, or established through use if such possibility is provided for in the legislation of the Party concerned, prior to the date of protection for the geographical indications listed in Annex III or IV, or prior to the date of application for protection for the geographical indications referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement.\nThe trade marks referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph may continue to be used and renewed provided that no grounds for the trade mark's invalidity or revocation exist in the legislation on trade marks of the Parties. It is understood that protection of geographical indications may be provided under legislation other than trade mark laws and regulations, such as legislation providing for sui generis protection of geographical indications.\nThe date of protection and the date of application for protection are determined in accordance with paragraph 5.\n5.   For the purposes of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of this Article, the \"date of protection\" and the \"date of application for protection\" shall be the following:\n—\nfor geographical indications listed in Annex III or IV, the date of protection shall be no later than the date of entry into force of this Agreement;\n—\nfor geographical indications listed in Annexes V and VI, the date of application for protection shall be the date of entry into force of this Agreement and the date of protection shall be no later than the date of entry into force of the respective modification to the Annex III or Annex IV;\n—\nfor geographical indications referred to in Article 3(2), the date of the publication for the protection of a geographical indication shall serve as the date of application for protection of that geographical indication and the date of protection shall be no later than the date of entry into force of the respective modification to Annex III or Annex IV.\n6.   As regards geographical indications listed in Annexes V and VI on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, trade marks applied for after the entry into force of this Agreement and corresponding to one of the situations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be rejected.\nAs regards geographical indications listed in Annex III on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, trade marks applied for in the European Union between the date of publication for opposition and the entry into force of this Agreement and corresponding to one of the situations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be presumed to have been applied for in bad faith.\nAs regards geographical indications listed in Annex IV on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, trade marks applied for in the People's Republic of China after 3 June 2017 and corresponding to one of the situations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be rejected.\nArticle 7\nEnforcement of protection\nThe Parties shall enforce the protection provided for in this Agreement through appropriate action by their authorities. They shall also enforce such protection at the request of an interested party. This Article is without prejudice to the rights of interested parties to seek judicial enforcement.\nArticle 8\nGeneral rules\n1.   The provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudice to any previous commitments of the Parties derived from international agreements on the protection of geographical indications and the enforcement thereof.\n2.   Import, export and marketing of products bearing geographical indications listed in Annex III or IV shall be conducted in compliance with the laws and regulations applicable in the territory of the Party in which the products are placed on the market.\n3.   Any matter arising from the technical specifications of registered products shall be dealt with in the Joint Committee established pursuant to Article 10.\n4.   The information on geographical indications, in particular the technical specifications for registration of a geographical indication as set out in Annex II, including any future amendments, shall be that examined and approved by the authorities of the Party in the territory in which the geographical indication concerned originates.\nArticle 9\nTransparency and exchange of information\n1.   The Parties shall, either through the Joint Committee established pursuant to Article 10 or directly through the established contact points when the Joint Committee is not in session, maintain contact on all matters relating to the implementation and functioning of this Agreement.

Each Party may make publicly available the information on geographical indications referred to in Article 8(4), including the technical specification or a summary thereof, and on contact points for control provisions corresponding to geographical indications of the other Party protected under this Agreement.\nArticle 10\nJoint Committee\n1.
