{"celex_id": "32011L0095", "reference": "20.12.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 337/9\nDIRECTIVE 2011/95/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 December 2011\non standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted\n(recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular points (a) and (b) of Article 78(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA number of substantive changes are to be made to Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (3). In the interests of clarity, that Directive should be recast.\n(2)\nA common policy on asylum, including a Common European Asylum System, is a constituent part of the European Union’s objective of progressively establishing an area of freedom, security and justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, legitimately seek protection in the Union.\n(3)\nThe European Council at its special meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 agreed to work towards establishing a Common European Asylum System, based on the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees (‘the Geneva Convention’), as supplemented by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967 (‘the Protocol’), thus affirming the principle of non-refoulement and ensuring that nobody is sent back to persecution.\n(4)\nThe Geneva Convention and the Protocol provide the cornerstone of the international legal regime for the protection of refugees.\n(5)\nThe Tampere conclusions provide that a Common European Asylum System should include, in the short term, the approximation of rules on the recognition of refugees and the content of refugee status.\n(6)\nThe Tampere conclusions also provide that rules regarding refugee status should be complemented by measures on subsidiary forms of protection, offering an appropriate status to any person in need of such protection.\n(7)\nThe first phase in the creation of a Common European Asylum System has now been achieved. The European Council of 4 November 2004 adopted the Hague Programme, which sets the objectives to be implemented in the area of freedom, security and justice in the period 2005-2010. In this respect, the Hague Programme invited the European Commission to conclude the evaluation of the first-phase legal instruments and to submit the second-phase instruments and measures to the European Parliament and the Council, with a view to their adoption before the end of 2010.\n(8)\nIn the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, adopted on 15 and 16 October 2008, the European Council noted that considerable disparities remain between one Member State and another concerning the grant of protection and the forms that protection takes and called for new initiatives to complete the establishment of a Common European Asylum System, provided for in the Hague Programme, and thus to offer a higher degree of protection.\n(9)\nIn the Stockholm Programme, the European Council reiterated its commitment to the objective of establishing a common area of protection and solidarity, based on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status, in accordance with Article 78 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), for those granted international protection, by 2012 at the latest.\n(10)\nIn the light of the results of the evaluations undertaken, it is appropriate, at this stage, to confirm the principles underlying Directive 2004/83/EC as well as to seek to achieve a higher level of approximation of the rules on the recognition and content of international protection on the basis of higher standards.\n(11)\nThe resources of the European Refugee Fund and of the European Asylum Support Office should be mobilised to provide adequate support to Member States’ efforts in implementing the standards set in the second phase of the Common European Asylum System, in particular to those Member States which are faced with specific and disproportionate pressure on their asylum systems, due in particular to their geographical or demographic situation.\n(12)\nThe main objective of this Directive is, on the one hand, to ensure that Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection, and, on the other hand, to ensure that a minimum level of benefits is available for those persons in all Member States.\n(13)\nThe approximation of rules on the recognition and content of refugee and subsidiary protection status should help to limit the secondary movement of applicants for international protection between Member States, where such movement is purely caused by differences in legal frameworks.\n(14)\nMember States should have the power to introduce or maintain more favourable provisions than the standards laid down in this Directive for third-country nationals or stateless persons who request international protection from a Member State, where such a request is understood to be on the grounds that the person concerned is either a refugee within the meaning of Article 1(A) of the Geneva Convention, or a person eligible for subsidiary protection.\n(15)\nThose third-country nationals or stateless persons who are allowed to remain in the territories of the Member States for reasons not due to a need for international protection but on a discretionary basis on compassionate or humanitarian grounds fall outside the scope of this Directive.\n(16)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for human dignity and the right to asylum of applicants for asylum and their accompanying family members and to promote the application of Articles 1, 7, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 24, 34 and 35 of that Charter, and should therefore be implemented accordingly.\n(17)\nWith respect to the treatment of persons falling within the scope of this Directive, Member States are bound by obligations under instruments of international law to which they are party, including in particular those that prohibit discrimination.\n(18)\nThe ‘best interests of the child’ should be a primary consideration of Member States when implementing this Directive, in line with the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In assessing the best interests of the child, Member States should in particular take due account of the principle of family unity, the minor’s well-being and social development, safety and security considerations and the views of the minor in accordance with his or her age and maturity.\n(19)\nIt is necessary to broaden the notion of family members, taking into account the different particular circumstances of dependency and the special attention to be paid to the best interests of the child.\n(20)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the Protocol on asylum for nationals of Member States of the European Union as annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the TFEU.\n(21)\nThe recognition of refugee status is a declaratory act.\n(22)\nConsultations with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees may provide valuable guidance for Member States when determining refugee status according to Article 1 of the Geneva Convention.\n(23)\nStandards for the definition and content of refugee status should be laid down to guide the competent national bodies of Member States in the application of the Geneva Convention.\n(24)\nIt is necessary to introduce common criteria for recognising applicants for asylum as refugees within the meaning of Article 1 of the Geneva Convention.\n(25)\nIn particular, it is necessary to introduce common concepts of protection needs arising sur place, sources of harm and protection, internal protection and persecution, including the reasons for persecution.\n(26)\nProtection can be provided, where they are willing and able to offer protection, either by the State or by parties or organisations, including international organisations, meeting the conditions set out in this Directive, which control a region or a larger area within the territory of the State. Such protection should be effective and of a non-temporary nature.\n(27)\nInternal protection against persecution or serious harm should be effectively available to the applicant in a part of the country of origin where he or she can safely and legally travel to, gain admittance to and can reasonably be expected to settle. Where the State or agents of the State are the actors of persecution or serious harm, there should be a presumption that effective protection is not available to the applicant. When the applicant is an unaccompanied minor, the availability of appropriate care and custodial arrangements, which are in the best interest of the unaccompanied minor, should form part of the assessment as to whether that protection is effectively available.\n(28)\nIt is necessary, when assessing applications from minors for international protection, that Member States should have regard to child-specific forms of persecution.\n(29)\nOne of the conditions for qualification for refugee status within the meaning of Article 1(A) of the Geneva Convention is the existence of a causal link between the reasons for persecution, namely race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group, and the acts of persecution or the absence of protection against such acts.\n(30)\nIt is equally necessary to introduce a common concept of the persecution ground ‘membership of a particular social group’. For the purposes of defining a particular social group, issues arising from an applicant’s gender, including gender identity and sexual orientation, which may be related to certain legal traditions and customs, resulting in for example genital mutilation, forced sterilisation or forced abortion, should be given due consideration in so far as they are related to the applicant’s well-founded fear of persecution.\n(31)\nActs contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations are set out in the Preamble and Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations and are, amongst others, embodied in the United Nations resolutions relating to measures combating terrorism, which declare that ‘acts, methods and practices of terrorism are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations’ and that ‘knowingly financing, planning and inciting terrorist acts are also contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations’.\n(32)\nAs referred to in Article 14, ‘status’ can also include refugee status.\n(33)\nStandards for the definition and content of subsidiary protection status should also be laid down. Subsidiary protection should be complementary and additional to the refugee protection enshrined in the Geneva Convention.\n(34)\nIt is necessary to introduce common criteria on the basis of which applicants for international protection are to be recognised as eligible for subsidiary protection. Those criteria should be drawn from international obligations under human rights instruments and practices existing in Member States.\n(35)\nRisks to which a population of a country or a section of the population is generally exposed do normally not create in themselves an individual threat which would qualify as serious harm.\n(36)\nFamily members, merely due to their relation to the refugee, will normally be vulnerable to acts of persecution in such a manner that could be the basis for refugee status.\n(37)\nThe notion of national security and public order also covers cases in which a third-country national belongs to an association which supports international terrorism or supports such an association.\n(38)\nWhen deciding on entitlements to the benefits included in this Directive, Member States should take due account of the best interests of the child, as well as of the particular circumstances of the dependency on the beneficiary of international protection of close relatives who are already present in the Member State and who are not family members of that beneficiary. In exceptional circumstances, where the close relative of the beneficiary of international protection is a married minor but not accompanied by his or her spouse, the best interests of the minor may be seen to lie with his or her original family.\n(39)\nWhile responding to the call of the Stockholm Programme for the establishment of a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and with the exception of derogations which are necessary and objectively justified, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status should be granted the same rights and benefits as those enjoyed by refugees under this Directive, and should be subject to the same conditions of eligibility.\n(40)\nWithin the limits set out by international obligations, Member States may lay down that the granting of benefits with regard to access to employment, social welfare, healthcare and access to integration facilities requires the prior issue of a residence permit.\n(41)\nIn order to enhance the effective exercise of the rights and benefits laid down in this Directive by beneficiaries of international protection, it is necessary to take into account their specific needs and the particular integration challenges with which they are confronted. Such taking into account should normally not result in a more favourable treatment than that provided to their own nationals, without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to introduce or retain more favourable standards.\n(42)\nIn that context, efforts should be made in particular to address the problems which prevent beneficiaries of international protection from having effective access to employment-related educational opportunities and vocational training, inter alia, relating to financial constraints.\n(43)\nThis Directive does not apply to financial benefits from the Member States which are granted to promote education.\n(44)\nSpecial measures need to be considered with a view to effectively addressing the practical difficulties encountered by beneficiaries of international protection concerning the authentication of their foreign diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications, in particular due to the lack of documentary evidence and their inability to meet the costs related to the recognition procedures.\n(45)\nEspecially to avoid social hardship, it is appropriate to provide beneficiaries of international protection with adequate social welfare and means of subsistence, without discrimination in the context of social assistance. With regard to social assistance, the modalities and detail of the provision of core benefits to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status should be determined by national law. The possibility of limiting such assistance to core benefits is to be understood as covering at least minimum income support, assistance in the case of illness, or pregnancy, and parental assistance, in so far as those benefits are granted to nationals under national law.\n(46)\nAccess to healthcare, including both physical and mental healthcare, should be ensured to beneficiaries of international protection.\n(47)\nThe specific needs and particularities of the situation of beneficiaries of refugee status and of subsidiary protection status should be taken into account, as far as possible, in the integration programmes provided to them including, where appropriate, language training and the provision of information concerning individual rights and obligations relating to their protection status in the Member State concerned.\n(48)\nThe implementation of this Directive should be evaluated at regular intervals, taking into consideration in particular the evolution of the international obligations of Member States regarding non-refoulement, the evolution of the labour markets in the Member States as well as the development of common basic principles for integration.\n(49)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely to establish standards for the granting of international protection to third-country nationals and stateless persons by Member States, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Directive, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(50)\nIn accordance with Articles 1, 2 and Article 4a(1) of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, the United Kingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(51)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(52)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with Directive 2004/83/EC. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under that Directive.\n(53)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limit for transposition into national law of Directive 2004/83/EC set out in Annex I, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Directive is to lay down standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection-granted.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘international protection’ means refugee status and subsidiary protection status as defined in points (e) and (g);\n(b)\n‘beneficiary of international protection’ means a person who has been granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status as defined in points (e) and (g);\n(c)\n‘Geneva Convention’ means the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967;\n(d)\n‘refugee’ means a third-country national who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group, is outside the country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country, or a stateless person, who, being outside of the country of former habitual residence for the same reasons as mentioned above, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it, and to whom Article 12 does not apply;\n(e)\n‘refugee status’ means the recognition by a Member State of a third-country national or a stateless person as a refugee;\n(f)\n‘person eligible for subsidiary protection’ means a third-country national or a stateless person who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, or in the case of a stateless person, to his or her country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm as defined in Article 15, and to whom Article 17(1) and (2) does not apply, and is unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country;\n(g)\n‘subsidiary protection status’ means the recognition by a Member State of a third-country national or a stateless person as a person eligible for subsidiary protection;\n(h)\n‘application for international protection’ means a request made by a third-country national or a stateless person for protection from a Member State, who can be understood to seek refugee status or subsidiary protection status, and who does not explicitly request another kind of protection, outside the scope of this Directive, that can be applied for separately;\n(i)\n‘applicant’ means a third-country national or a stateless person who has made an application for international protection in respect of which a final decision has not yet been taken;\n(j)\n‘family members’ means, in so far as the family already existed in the country of origin, the following members of the family of the beneficiary of international protection who are present in the same Member State in relation to the application for international protection:\n—\nthe spouse of the beneficiary of international protection or his or her unmarried partner in a stable relationship, where the law or practice of the Member State concerned treats unmarried couples in a way comparable to married couples under its law relating to third-country nationals,\n—\nthe minor children of the couples referred to in the first indent or of the beneficiary of international protection, on condition that they are unmarried and regardless of whether they were born in or out of wedlock or adopted as defined under national law,\n—\nthe father, mother or another adult responsible for the beneficiary of international protection whether by law or by the practice of the Member State concerned, when that beneficiary is a minor and unmarried;\n(k)\n‘minor’ means a third-country national or stateless person below the age of 18 years;\n(l)\n‘unaccompanied minor’ means a minor who arrives on the territory of the Member States unaccompanied by an adult responsible for him or her whether by law or by the practice of the Member State concerned, and for as long as he or she is not effectively taken into the care of such a person;

Member States may consider it the duty of the applicant to submit as soon as possible all the elements needed to substantiate the application for international protection. In cooperation with the applicant, it is the duty of the Member State to assess the relevant elements of the application.\n2.   The elements referred to in paragraph 1 consist of the applicant’s statements and all the documentation at the applicant’s disposal regarding the applicant’s age, background, including that of relevant relatives, identity, nationality(ies), country(ies) and place(s) of previous residence, previous asylum applications, travel routes, travel documents and the reasons for applying for international protection.\n3.   The assessment of an application for international protection is to be carried out on an individual basis and includes taking into account:\n(a)\nall relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin at the time of taking a decision on the application, including laws and regulations of the country of origin and the manner in which they are applied;\n(b)\nthe relevant statements and documentation presented by the applicant including information on whether the applicant has been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm;\n(c)\nthe individual position and personal circumstances of the applicant, including factors such as background, gender and age, so as to assess whether, on the basis of the applicant’s personal circumstances, the acts to which the applicant has been or could be exposed would amount to persecution or serious harm;\n(d)\nwhether the applicant’s activities since leaving the country of origin were engaged in for the sole or main purpose of creating the necessary conditions for applying for international protection, so as to assess whether those activities would expose the applicant to persecution or serious harm if returned to that country;\n(e)\nwhether the applicant could reasonably be expected to avail himself or herself of the protection of another country where he or she could assert citizenship.\n4.   The fact that an applicant has already been subject to persecution or serious harm, or to direct threats of such persecution or such harm, is a serious indication of the applicant’s well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons to consider that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.\n5.   Where Member States apply the principle according to which it is the duty of the applicant to substantiate the application for international protection and where aspects of the applicant’s statements are not supported by documentary or other evidence, those aspects shall not need confirmation when the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe applicant has made a genuine effort to substantiate his application;\n(b)\nall relevant elements at the applicant’s disposal have been submitted, and a satisfactory explanation has been given regarding any lack of other relevant elements;\n(c)\nthe applicant’s statements are found to be coherent and plausible and do not run counter to available specific and general information relevant to the applicant’s case;\n(d)\nthe applicant has applied for international protection at the earliest possible time, unless the applicant can demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and\n(e)\nthe general credibility of the applicant has been established.\nArticle 5\nInternational protection needs arising sur place\n1.   A well-founded fear of being persecuted or a real risk of suffering serious harm may be based on events which have taken place since the applicant left the country of origin.\n2.   A well-founded fear of being persecuted or a real risk of suffering serious harm may be based on activities which the applicant has engaged in since he or she left the country of origin, in particular where it is established that the activities relied upon constitute the expression and continuation of convictions or orientations held in the country of origin.\n3.   Without prejudice to the Geneva Convention, Member States may determine that an applicant who files a subsequent application shall not normally be granted refugee status if the risk of persecution is based on circumstances which the applicant has created by his or her own decision since leaving the country of origin.\nArticle 6\nActors of persecution or serious harm\nActors of persecution or serious harm include:\n(a)\nthe State;\n(b)\nparties or organisations controlling the State or a substantial part of the territory of the State;\n(c)\nnon-State actors, if it can be demonstrated that the actors mentioned in points (a) and (b), including international organisations, are unable or unwilling to provide protection against persecution or serious harm as defined in Article 7.\nArticle 7\nActors of protection\n1.   Protection against persecution or serious harm can only be provided by:\n(a)\nthe State; or\n(b)\nparties or organisations, including international organisations, controlling the State or a substantial part of the territory of the State;\nprovided they are willing and able to offer protection in accordance with paragraph 2.\n2.   Protection against persecution or serious harm must be effective and of a non-temporary nature. Such protection is generally provided when the actors mentioned under points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 take reasonable steps to prevent the persecution or suffering of serious harm, inter alia, by operating an effective legal system for the detection, prosecution and punishment of acts constituting persecution or serious harm, and when the applicant has access to such protection.\n3.   When assessing whether an international organisation controls a State or a substantial part of its territory and provides protection as described in paragraph 2, Member States shall take into account any guidance which may be provided in relevant Union acts.\nArticle 8\nInternal protection\n1.   As part of the assessment of the application for international protection, Member States may determine that an applicant is not in need of international protection if in a part of the country of origin, he or she:\n(a)\nhas no well-founded fear of being persecuted or is not at real risk of suffering serious harm; or\n(b)\nhas access to protection against persecution or serious harm as defined in Article 7;\nand he or she can safely and legally travel to and gain admittance to that part of the country and can reasonably be expected to settle there.\n2.   In examining whether an applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted or is at real risk of suffering serious harm, or has access to protection against persecution or serious harm in a part of the country of origin in accordance with paragraph 1, Member States shall at the time of taking the decision on the application have regard to the general circumstances prevailing in that part of the country and to the personal circumstances of the applicant in accordance with Article 4. To that end, Member States shall ensure that precise and up-to-date information is obtained from relevant sources, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the European Asylum Support Office.\nCHAPTER III\nQUALIFICATION FOR BEING A REFUGEE\nArticle 9\nActs of persecution\n1.   In order to be regarded as an act of persecution within the meaning of Article 1(A) of the Geneva Convention, an act must:\n(a)\nbe sufficiently serious by its nature or repetition as to constitute a severe violation of basic human rights, in particular the rights from which derogation cannot be made under Article 15(2) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; or\n(b)\nbe an accumulation of various measures, including violations of human rights which is sufficiently severe as to affect an individual in a similar manner as mentioned in point (a).\n2.   Acts of persecution as qualified in paragraph 1 can, inter alia, take the form of:\n(a)\nacts of physical or mental violence, including acts of sexual violence;\n(b)\nlegal, administrative, police, and/or judicial measures which are in themselves discriminatory or which are implemented in a discriminatory manner;\n(c)\nprosecution or punishment which is disproportionate or discriminatory;\n(d)\ndenial of judicial redress resulting in a disproportionate or discriminatory punishment;\n(e)\nprosecution or punishment for refusal to perform military service in a conflict, where performing military service would include crimes or acts falling within the scope of the grounds for exclusion as set out in Article 12(2);\n(f)\nacts of a gender-specific or child-specific nature.\n3.   In accordance with point (d) of Article 2, there must be a connection between the reasons mentioned in Article 10 and the acts of persecution as qualified in paragraph 1 of this Article or the absence of protection against such acts.\nArticle 10\nReasons for persecution\n1.   Member States shall take the following elements into account when assessing the reasons for persecution:\n(a)\nthe concept of race shall, in particular, include considerations of colour, descent, or membership of a particular ethnic group;\n(b)\nthe concept of religion shall in particular include the holding of theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, the participation in, or abstention from, formal worship in private or in public, either alone or in community with others, other religious acts or expressions of view, or forms of personal or communal conduct based on or mandated by any religious belief;\n(c)\nthe concept of nationality shall not be confined to citizenship or lack thereof but shall, in particular, include membership of a group determined by its cultural, ethnic, or linguistic identity, common geographical or political origins or its relationship with the population of another State;\n(d)\na group shall be considered to form a particular social group where in particular:\n—\nmembers of that group share an innate characteristic, or a common background that cannot be changed, or share a characteristic or belief that is so fundamental to identity or conscience that a person should not be forced to renounce it, and\n—\nthat group has a distinct identity in the relevant country, because it is perceived as being different by the surrounding society.\nDepending on the circumstances in the country of origin, a particular social group might include a group based on a common characteristic of sexual orientation. Sexual orientation cannot be understood to include acts considered to be criminal in accordance with national law of the Member States. Gender related aspects, including gender identity, shall be given due consideration for the purposes of determining membership of a particular social group or identifying a characteristic of such a group;\n(e)\nthe concept of political opinion shall, in particular, include the holding of an opinion, thought or belief on a matter related to the potential actors of persecution mentioned in Article 6 and to their policies or methods, whether or not that opinion, thought or belief has been acted upon by the applicant.\n2.   When assessing if an applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted it is immaterial whether the applicant actually possesses the racial, religious, national, social or political characteristic which attracts the persecution, provided that such a characteristic is attributed to the applicant by the actor of persecution.\nArticle 11\nCessation\n1.   A third-country national or a stateless person shall cease to be a refugee if he or she:\n(a)\nhas voluntarily re-availed himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality; or\n(b)\nhaving lost his or her nationality, has voluntarily re-acquired it; or\n(c)\nhas acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his or her new nationality; or\n(d)\nhas voluntarily re-established himself or herself in the country which he or she left or outside which he or she remained owing to fear of persecution; or\n(e)\ncan no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he or she has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality; or\n(f)\nbeing a stateless person, he or she is able, because the circumstances in connection with which he or she has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, to return to the country of former habitual residence.\n2.   In considering points (e) and (f) of paragraph 1, Member States shall have regard to whether the change of circumstances is of such a significant and non-temporary nature that the refugee’s fear of persecution can no longer be regarded as well-founded.\n3.   Points (e) and (f) of paragraph 1 shall not apply to a refugee who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality or, being a stateless person, of the country of former habitual residence.\nArticle 12\nExclusion\n1.   A third-country national or a stateless person is excluded from being a refugee if:\n(a)\nhe or she falls within the scope of Article 1(D) of the Geneva Convention, relating to protection or assistance from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. When such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason, without the position of such persons being definitely settled in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, those persons shall ipso facto be entitled to the benefits of this Directive;\n(b)\nhe or she is recognised by the competent authorities of the country in which he or she has taken up residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country, or rights and obligations equivalent to those.\n2.   A third-country national or a stateless person is excluded from being a refugee where there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a)\nhe or she has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\n(b)\nhe or she has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his or her admission as a refugee, which means the time of issuing a residence permit based on the granting of refugee status; particularly cruel actions, even if committed with an allegedly political objective, may be classified as serious non-political crimes;\n(c)\nhe or she has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations as set out in the Preamble and Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations.\n3.

In situations described in paragraph 4, Member States may decide not to grant status to a refugee, where such a decision has not yet been taken.\n6.   Persons to whom paragraphs 4 or 5 apply are entitled to rights set out in or similar to those set out in Articles 3, 4, 16, 22, 31, 32 and 33 of the Geneva Convention in so far as they are present in the Member State.\nCHAPTER V\nQUALIFICATION FOR SUBSIDIARY PROTECTION\nArticle 15\nSerious harm\nSerious harm consists of:\n(a)\nthe death penalty or execution; or\n(b)\ntorture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin; or\n(c)\nserious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.\nArticle 16\nCessation\n1.

A third-country national or a stateless person is excluded from being eligible for subsidiary protection where there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a)\nhe or she has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\n(b)\nhe or she has committed a serious crime;\n(c)\nhe or she has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations as set out in the Preamble and Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations;\n(d)\nhe or she constitutes a danger to the community or to the security of the Member State in which he or she is present.\n2.   Paragraph 1 applies to persons who incite or otherwise participate in the commission of the crimes or acts mentioned therein.\n3.   Member States may exclude a third-country national or a stateless person from being eligible for subsidiary protection if he or she, prior to his or her admission to the Member State concerned, has committed one or more crimes outside the scope of paragraph 1 which would be punishable by imprisonment, had they been committed in the Member State concerned, and if he or she left his or her country of origin solely in order to avoid sanctions resulting from those crimes.\nCHAPTER VI\nSUBSIDIARY PROTECTION STATUS\nArticle 18\nGranting of subsidiary protection status\nMember States shall grant subsidiary protection status to a third-country national or a stateless person eligible for subsidiary protection in accordance with Chapters II and V.\nArticle 19\nRevocation of, ending of or refusal to renew subsidiary protection status\n1.

However, EU countries remain free to introduce or keep more favourable rules for the persons in need of protection.\n‘Refugees’ and ‘persons eligible for subsidiary protection’ are defined, as are their ‘family members’ — extended to the father, mother or other adult responsible for the beneficiary of international protection if the person is under 18 (a minor) and unmarried.\nAssessment of applications\nEU countries have a shared duty to cooperate actively with the applicant when determining the relevant elements of an application.\nA non-exhaustive list is given of aspects including facts, statements and circumstances (for example, if the person has suffered persecution) which must be taken into account in the assessment on an individual, objective and impartial basis.\nWhen they have made every effort to submit and substantiate their application and the general credibility of their application has been established, asylum seekers should be given the benefit of the doubt even if the application lacks documentary or other evidence.\nApplicants may be considered not to need international protection if they can benefit from internal protection from persecution or serious harm in any part of the territory of their country of origin to which they can safely and legally have access and where they can reasonably be expected to settle.\nThe directive clarifies that: protection against persecution or serious harm can only be provided by the state or parties or organisations, including international organisations, controlling the state or a substantial part of its territory;these parties should be able and willing to offer effective and non-temporary protection;the applicant should have access to such protection.\nEU countries should use precise and up-to-date information from relevant sources, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the European Asylum Support Office.\nQualifying for refugee status\nWhat an ‘act of persecution’ is within the meaning of the Geneva Convention is clarified with regard to the status of refugees, and the different forms it can take.\nThere must be a reason for the persecution, and the text indicates the aspects — race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion — to be taken into account for assessing reasons for persecution.\nThe absence of protection from persecution for one of the reasons indicated above is also a reason to qualify for refugee status.\nQualifying for subsidiary protection\nThe ‘serious harm’ a non-EU national concerned would risk suffering if returned to his or her country of origin, or in the case of a stateless person, to his or her country of former habitual residence, includes:\nthe death penalty or execution;\ntorture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;\nserious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of armed conflict.\nLosing or being excluded from refugee status or subsidiary protection\nThe directive lists:\ncircumstances in which refugee status or subsidiary protection cease (for instance where the applicant acquires a new nationality) or are excluded (for example if the applicant has committed a war crime or a crime against humanity);\ngrounds on which those rights can be revoked, ended or their renewal refused — including when there are reasonable grounds for regarding the applicant as a danger to the security or the community of the host EU country.\nContent of international protection\nThe content of the status of a beneficiary of subsidiary protection is brought closer to that of a refugee, largely eliminating the possibility for EU countries to limit the access to some rights to refugees only.International protection to be granted by the host EU country includes the following rights.\nProtection from refoulement*.\nAccess of refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection to information, in a language they can understand or are reasonably supposed to understand, on the rights and obligations related to their status.\nProtection of family unity.\nUnless there are compelling reasons of national security or public order, the issuing of: residence permits — valid for at least 3 years for refugees, and at least 1 year (2 years upon renewal) in the case of subsidiary protection, andtravel documents to travel outside the national territory — in the case of subsidiary protection, only when individuals are unable to obtain a national passport.\nAccess to employment and employment-related educational and training opportunities, with equal treatment in conditions of employment.\nAccess to education — equal treatment with nationals for minors and with legally resident non-EU nationals for adults.\nEqual access to procedures for the recognition of foreign diplomas and professional qualifications.\nEqual treatment with nationals in respect of social welfare (this may be limited to core benefits in the case of subsidiary protection).\nRepresentation of unaccompanied minors by a legal guardian or, where necessary, by an organisation responsible for the well-being of minors, or by any other appropriate representation as provided within the national legal system.\nAccess to accommodation under equivalent conditions to those of other non-EU nationals legally resident.\nFreedom of movement within the national territory under the same conditions and restrictions as for other non-EU nationals legally resident.\nAccess to integration facilities.\nIf required, assistance for repatriation.\nCountries falling outside the scope of the directive\nIreland and the UK (1) have opted out of the directive, as they were allowed to do by Protocol 21 annexed to the Lisbon Treaty. Consequently, they continue to be bound by Directive 2004/83/EC.Denmark is not bound by either this or by the previous directive due to the Protocol 22 on its position annexed to the Lisbon Treaty.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2011/95/EU revises and replaces Directive 2004/83/EC. Most of the articles of the directive 2011/95/EU, relating to aspects that were not covered by Directive 2004/83/EC, have applied since 22 December 2013. The new rules contained in Directive 2011/95/EU had to become law in the EU countries by 21 December 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nKnown as the ‘Qualification Directive’, the directive is one of the main instruments within the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) together with the Asylum Procedures Directive, Reception Conditions Directive, Dublin Regulation and EURODAC Regulation.
