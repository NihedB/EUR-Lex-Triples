{"celex_id": "32019R0124", "reference": "31.1.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 29/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2019/124\nof 30 January 2019\nfixing for 2019 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 43(3) of the Treaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) requires that conservation measures be adopted taking into account available scientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and other advisory bodies, as well as any advice received from Advisory Councils.\n(3)\nIt is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing opportunities should be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) established in Article 2(2) of that Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(1) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery.\n(4)\nThe total allowable catch (TAC) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings of the Advisory Councils.\n(5)\nIn accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the full landing obligation is to apply at the latest from 1 January 2019. When a fishery falls under the landing obligation, all species in that fishery subject to catch limits should be landed. Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, when the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches. On the basis of the joint recommendations submitted by the Member States and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the Commission adopted a number of delegated Regulations laying down details for the implementation of the landing obligation in the form of specific discard plans applicable on a temporary basis for a maximum period of three years.\n(6)\nThe fishing opportunities for stocks of species falling under the landing obligation from 1 January 2019 should take into account the fact that discarding will in principle no longer be allowed. Therefore, the fishing opportunities should be based on the advice figure for total catches (instead of the advice figure for total landings), as provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The amounts that, by way of exception, may continue to be discarded during the operation of the landing obligation should be deducted from that advice figure for total catches.\n(7)\nThere are certain stocks for which ICES has issued scientific advice for no catches. If the TACs for those stocks are set at the level indicated in the scientific advice, the obligation to land all catches in mixed fisheries with by-catches from these stocks would lead to the phenomenon of ‘choke species’. In order to strike the right balance between continuing fisheries in view of the potentially severe socio-economic implications, and the need to achieve a good biological status for those stocks, taking into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at maximum sustainable yield at the same time, it is appropriate to establish specific TACs for by-catches for those stocks. The level of these TACs should be such that mortality for these stocks is not increased and that it provides incentives for improvements in selectivity and avoidance. In order to guarantee to the extent possible the use of fishing opportunities in mixed fisheries in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is appropriate to establish a pool for quota exchanges for those Member States that have no quota to cover their unavoidable by-catches.\n(8)\nIn order to progressively reduce unwanted catches of the stocks concerned, Member States should as from 2019 implement multiannual by-catch reduction plans in the relevant fisheries with a view to progressively reducing unwanted catches of the stocks concerned by taking national measures and, where appropriate, by cooperating at regional level in order to submit joint recommendations to the Commission in 2019. These by-catch reduction plans are to be evaluated by STECF and reviewed two years after their entry into application. In addition, all vessels benefitting from these specific TACs should implement full catch documentation as from 2019.\n(9)\nAccording to scientific advice, European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in the Celtic Sea, Channel, Irish Sea and southern North Sea (ICES divisions 4b, 4c, 7a, and 7d to 7h) remains in a perilous state. Spawning-stock biomass has been declining since 2005 and is now below Blim. Fishing mortality has increased over the time-series, peaking in 2013 before a rapid decline to below the fishing mortality that results in the maximum sustainable yield (FMSY). Recruitment was estimated to be poor since 2008, with the exception of the 2013 and 2014 year-class estimates which show average recruitment. ICES advises that when the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) approach is applied, total removals in 2019 should be no more than 1 789 tonnes, which is an increase compared to the 2018 advice. Therefore, higher catches could be allowed for hooks and lines fishery for this species. It is also appropriate to continue the set of measures for unavoidable by-catches of European seabass with certain other gears, while providing a limited increase in the catch allowances. Measures for managing recreational fisheries for European seabass should be adapted, taking account of the significant impact of such fisheries on the stocks concerned. Within the limits of the scientific advice, the catch-and-release practice and bag limit should continue, but should be applied for a longer period.\n(10)\nAs regards the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) stock, the ICES has advised that all anthropogenic mortalities, including recreational and commercial fisheries, should be reduced to zero, or kept as close to zero as possible. Moreover, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted Recommendation GFCM/42/2018/1 establishing management measures for European eel in the Mediterranean Sea. It is appropriate to establish a level playing field across the Union and hence to establish also for the Union waters of the ICES area as well as brackish waters such as estuaries, coastal lagoons and transitional waters a consecutive three-month closure period for all fisheries of European eel at all life stages. As the fishing closure period should be consistent with the conservation objectives set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 (2) and with the temporal migration patterns of European eel, for the Union waters of the ICES area it is appropriate to set it in the period between 1 August 2019 and 29 February 2020.\n(11)\nFor some years, certain TACs for stocks of elasmobranchs (skates, sharks, rays) have been set at zero, with a linked provision establishing an obligation to immediately release accidental catches. The reason for that specific treatment was the poor conservation status of those stocks and the assumption that discarding, because of high survival rates, would not raise fishing mortality rates and would be beneficial for the conservation of those species. As of 1 January 2019, however, catches of those species have to be landed, unless they are covered by any of the derogations from the landing obligation provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Point (a) of Article 15(4) of that Regulation allows such derogations for species in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the CFP. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit the fishing of those species in the areas concerned.\n(12)\nPursuant to Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, for stocks subject to specific multiannual plans the TACs should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in those plans.\n(13)\nThe North Sea multiannual plan was established by Regulation (EU) 2018/973 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and entered into force in 2018. Fishing opportunities for stocks listed in Article 1 of that Plan should be established in accordance with targets (ranges of FMSY) and safeguards in compliance with conditions provided for in that Plan. The ranges of FMSY have been identified in the relevant ICES advice. Fishing opportunities for by-catch stocks in the North Sea should be established in accordance with the precautionary approach, as set out in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/973. In order to limit variations in fishing opportunities between consecutive years, in accordance with point (c) of Article 4(5) of that Regulation, it is appropriate to use the upper range of FMSY for common sole in ICES division 2a and subarea 4.\n(14)\nThe TACs for stocks of sole in the Western Channel and of bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean should be established in accordance with the rules laid down Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2007 (4) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1627 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). The objective for the Southern hake stock as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005 (6) is to rebuild the biomass of the stocks concerned to a level that is within safe biological limits, while staying in line with the scientific data. In accordance with scientific advice, in the absence of definitive data on a target spawning stock biomass and while taking into account changes in safe biological limits, it is appropriate, in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, to fix the TAC on the basis of the maximum sustainable yield advice provided by ICES.\n(15)\nAs a result of a benchmark exercise on the stock of herring to the west of Scotland, ICES has provided advice for the combined herring stocks in divisions 6a, 7b and 7c (West of Scotland, West of Ireland). The advice covers two separate TACs (for divisions 6aS, 7b and 7c on the one hand, and for divisions 5b, 6b and 6aN on the other). According to ICES, a rebuilding plan has to be developed for those stocks. Since, according to scientific advice, the management plan for the northern stock (7) cannot be applied to the combined stocks and it is not possible to set separate fishing opportunities for those two stocks, a TAC should be established to permit limited catches in a commercially operated scientific sampling programme.\n(16)\nFor stocks for which there is no sufficient or reliable data in order to provide size estimates, management measures and TAC levels should follow the precautionary approach to fisheries management as defined in point (8) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, while taking into account stock-specific factors, including, in particular, available information on stock trends and mixed fisheries considerations.\n(17)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (8) introduced additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs including, under Articles 3 and 4 of that Regulation, flexibility provisions for precautionary and analytical TACs. Under Article 2 of that Regulation, when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Article 3 or 4 of that Regulation is not to apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently, the year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the CFP and deteriorate the biological status of the stocks, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.\n(18)\nWhere a TAC relating to a stock is allocated to one Member State only, it is appropriate to empower that Member State in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty to determine the level of such TAC. Provisions should be made to ensure that, when fixing that TAC level, the Member State concerned acts in a manner fully consistent with the principles and rules of the CFP.\n(19)\nIt is necessary to establish the fishing effort ceilings for 2019 in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 509/2007, and Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 of, and Annex I to, Regulation (EU) 2016/1627.\n(20)\nIn order to guarantee full use of fishing opportunities, it is appropriate to allow for the implementation of a flexible arrangement between certain TAC areas where the same biological stock is concerned.\n(21)\nFor certain species, such as certain species of sharks, even a limited fishing activity could result in a serious conservation risk. Fishing opportunities for such species should therefore be fully restricted through a general prohibition on fishing those species.\n(22)\nAt the 12th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, held in Manila from 23 to 28 October 2017, a number of species were added to the lists of protected species in Appendices I and II of the Convention. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the protection of those species with respect to Union fishing vessels fishing in all waters and non-Union fishing vessels fishing in Union waters.\n(23)\nThe use of fishing opportunities available to Union fishing vessels set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (9), and in particular to Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation, concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by Member States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.\n(24)\nIt is appropriate, following advice from the ICES, to maintain a specific system to manage sandeel and associated by-catches in Union waters of ICES divisions 2a and 3a and ICES subarea 4. Given that the ICES scientific advice is expected to become available only in February 2019, it is appropriate to set the TAC and quotas for that stock provisionally at zero until such advice is released.\n(25)\nIn accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway (10) and the Faroe Islands (11), the Union has held consultations on fishing rights with those partners. In accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreement and protocol on fisheries relations with Greenland (12), the Joint Committee has established the level of fishing opportunities available for the Union in Greenland waters in 2019. It is therefore necessary to include those fishing opportunities in this Regulation.\n(26)\nAt its annual meeting in 2018, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted conservation measures for the two redfish stocks in the Irminger Sea. Those measures should be implemented in Union law.\n(27)\nAt its annual meeting in 2017, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) agreed that in 2018 and 2019, the Union may distribute the unallocated reserves for bluefin tuna for 2019 and 2020, considering in particular the needs of coastal developing ICCAT contracting parties and cooperating non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities (CPCs) in their artisanal fisheries. That distribution was agreed at the inter-sessional meeting of Panel 2 of ICCAT (Madrid, March 2018) based, for the Union allocation, on the information received from Member States, in particular Greece, Spain and Portugal. As a result of that the Union received specific catch possibilities of 87 tonnes for 2019 and 100 tonnes for 2020 to be used by Union artisanal fleets in certain Union regions. That allocation of new fishing possibilities was endorsed by ICCAT at its annual meeting in 2018 and it is therefore relevant to establish an allocation key for those additional fishing possibilities.\n(28)\nIn 2019, the TAC for Mediterranean swordfish is decreased in line with the ICCAT Recommendation 16 05. As it is already the case for the stock of Eastern and Mediterranean bluefin tuna, it is appropriate that catches in recreational fisheries of all other ICCAT stocks should be subject to the catch limits as adopted by the ICCAT. Furthermore, Union fishing vessels of at least 20 metres length fishing for bigeye tuna in the ICCAT Convention Area should be subject to the capacity limitations adopted by ICCAT in the ICCAT Recommendation 15 01. All those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(29)\nAt its 37th annual meeting in 2018, the Parties to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopted catch limits for both target and by-catch species for the period from 1 December 2018 to 30 November 2019. The uptake of the quotas during 2018 should be considered when setting fishing opportunities for 2019.\n(30)\nAt its annual meeting in 2017, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted new catch limits for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) that do not affect the Union catch limits in IOTC. It also reduced possibilities for using fish-aggregating devices (FADs) and supply vessels. Those provisions were not revised at its annual meeting in 2018 and should thus continue being implemented in the law of the Union.\n(31)\nThe annual meeting of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) will be held from 23 to 27 January 2019. It is appropriate that the current measures in the SPRFMO Convention Area are provisionally maintained until such annual meeting is held.\n(32)\nAt its annual meeting in 2017, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) adopted a conservation measure for yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna for the period 2018-2020. It was not revised at its annual meeting in 2018 and should thus continue being implemented in the law of the Union.\n(33)\nAt its annual meeting in 2018, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) confirmed the TAC for the Southern bluefin tuna for the period 2018-2020 adopted at the annual meeting in 2016. The currently applicable measures on allocation of fishing opportunities adopted by CCSBT should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(34)\nAt its annual meeting in 2018, the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) adopted TACs for the main species under its purview. The applicable measures on allocation of fishing opportunities adopted by SEAFO should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(35)\nAt its 15th annual meeting in 2018, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) adopted conservation and management measures. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union through an amendment to these fishing opportunities in 2019.\n(36)\nAt its 40th annual meeting in 2018, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) adopted a number of fishing opportunities for 2019 for certain stocks in subareas 1 to 4 of the NAFO Convention Area. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(37)\nAt its 42nd annual meeting in 2018, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted catch and effort limits for certain small pelagic stocks for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 in the geographical subareas 17 and 18 (Adriatic Sea) of the GFCM Agreement Area. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union. The maximum catch limits established in Annex IL are fixed exclusively for one year and without prejudice to any other measures adopted in the future and any possible allocation scheme between Member States.\n(38)\nAt its 42nd annual meeting in 2018, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted Recommendation GFCM/42/2018/1 establishing management measures for European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) in the Mediterranean Sea. These measures are already implemented at Union level through Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007. The Recommendation also includes an annual closure period of three consecutive months which needs to be transposed into Union law and defined by each Member State in accordance with the conservation objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007, its management plan(s) for eel and the temporal migration patterns of eel in the Member State. The closure shall apply to all marine waters of the Mediterranean and to brackish waters such as estuaries, coastal lagoons and transitional waters, in accordance with the Recommendation.\n(39)\nTaking into account the particularities of the Slovenian fleet and their marginal impact on the stocks of small pelagic species, it is appropriate to preserve the existing fishing patterns and to ensure access of the Slovenian fleet to a minimum quantity of small pelagic species.\n(40)\nThe 5th Meeting of the Parties of the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) in 2018 adopted conservation and management measures for the stocks under the scope of the Agreement. Those measures should be implemented in Union law.\n(41)\nCertain international measures which create or restrict fishing opportunities for the Union are adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) at the end of the year and become applicable before the entry into force of this Regulation. It is therefore necessary for the provisions that implement such measures in the law of the Union to apply retroactively. In particular, since the fishing season in CCAMLR Convention Area runs from 1 December to 30 November, and thus certain fishing opportunities or prohibitions in the CCAMLR Convention Area are laid down for a period of time starting from 1 December 2018, it is appropriate that the relevant provisions of this Regulation apply from that date. Such retroactive application does not prejudice the principle of legitimate expectations as CCAMLR members are forbidden to fish in the CCAMLR Convention Area without authorisation.\n(42)\nAs regards the fishing opportunities for snow crab around the area of Svalbard, the Treaty of Paris of 1920 grants equal and non-discriminatory access to resources for all parties to that Treaty, including with respect to fishing. The view of the Union concerning that access, as regards fishing for snow crab on the continental shelf around Svalbard, has been set out in two notes verbales to Norway dated 25 October 2016 and 24 February 2017. In order to ensure that the exploitation of snow crab within the area of Svalbard is made consistent with such non-discriminatory management rules as may be set out by Norway, which enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction in the area within the limits of the said Treaty, it is appropriate to fix the number of vessels that are authorised to conduct such fishery. The allocation of such fishing opportunities among Member States is limited to 2019. It is recalled that in the Union primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with applicable law lies with the flag Member States.\n(43)\nIn accordance with the declaration by the Union addressed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on the granting of fishing opportunities in Union waters to fishing vessels flying the flag of Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of French Guiana (13), it is necessary to fix the fishing opportunities for snapper available to Venezuela in Union waters.\n(44)\nGiven that certain provisions are to be applied on a continuous basis, and in order to avoid legal uncertainty during the period between the end of 2019 and the date of entry into force of the Regulation fixing the fishing opportunities for 2020, the provisions concerning prohibitions and closed seasons set out in this Regulation should continue to apply at the beginning of 2020, until the entry into force of the Regulation fixing the fishing opportunities for 2020.\n(45)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards authorising individual Member States to manage fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt-day system. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).\n(46)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards granting of additional days at sea for permanent cessation of fishing activities and for enhanced scientific observer coverage as well as establishing formats of spreadsheets for the collection and transmission of information concerning transfer of days at sea between fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(47)\nIn order to avoid the interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the fishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2019, except for the provisions concerning fishing effort limits, which should apply from 1 February 2019, and certain provisions concerning particular regions, which should have a specific date of application. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication.\n(48)\nFishing opportunities should be used in full compliance with Union law,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.

FISHING VESSELS\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 5\nTACs and allocations\n1.   The TACs for Union fishing vessels in Union waters or certain non-Union waters and the allocation of such TACs among Member States, and the conditions functionally linked thereto, where appropriate, are set out in Annex I.\n2.   Union fishing vessels shall be authorised to make catches, within the TACs set out in Annex I to this Regulation, in waters falling within the fisheries jurisdiction of the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Norway, and the fishing zone around Jan Mayen, subject to the condition set out in Article 15 of, and Annex III to, this Regulation and in Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28) and its implementing provisions.\nArticle 6\nTACs to be determined by Member States\n1.   The TACs for certain fish stocks shall be determined by the Member State concerned. Those stocks are identified in Annex I.\n2.   The TACs to be determined by a Member State shall:\n(a)\nbe consistent with the principles and rules of the CFP, in particular the principle of sustainable exploitation of the stock; and\n(b)\nresult:\n(i)\nif analytical assessments are available, in the exploitation of the stock consistent with maximum sustainable yield from 2019 onwards, with as high a probability as possible; or\n(ii)\nif analytical assessments are unavailable or incomplete, in the exploitation of the stock consistent with the precautionary approach to fisheries management.\n3.   By 15 March 2019, each Member State concerned shall submit the following information to the Commission:\n(a)\nthe TACs adopted;\n(b)\nthe data collected and assessed by the Member State concerned on which the TACs adopted are based;\n(c)\ndetails on how the TACs adopted comply with paragraph 2.\nArticle 7\nConditions for landing catches and by-catches\n1.   Catches that are not subject to the landing obligation established in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 shall be retained on board or landed only if they:\n(a)\nhave been taken by vessels flying the flag of a Member State having a quota and that quota has not been exhausted; or\n(b)\nconsist of a share in a Union quota which has not been allocated by quota among Member States, and that Union quota has not been exhausted.\n2.   The stocks of non-target species within safe biological limits referred to in Article 15(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 are identified in Annex I to this Regulation for the purposes of the derogation from the obligation to count catches against the relevant quotas provided for in that Article.\nArticle 8\nQuota exchanges mechanism for TACs for unavoidable by-catches related to the introduction of the landing obligation\n1.   In order to take into account the introduction of the landing obligation and to make quotas available to Member States without a quota for certain by-catches, the quota exchange mechanism as defined in this Article shall apply to the TACs identified in Annex IA.\n2.   6 % of each quota from the TACs for cod in the Celtic Sea, cod in the West of Scotland, whiting in the Irish Sea and plaice in ICES divisions 7h, 7j and 7k, and 3 % of each quota from the TAC for West of Scotland whiting, allocated to each Member State, shall be made available for a pool for quota exchanges, which shall open as of 1 January 2019. Member States without quota shall have exclusive access to the quota pool until 31 March 2019.\n3.   The quantities drawn from the pool may not be exchanged or transferred to the following year. Any unused quantities shall be returned to those Member States that have initially contributed to the pool for quota exchanges after 31 March 2019.\n4.   The quotas provided in return shall be preferably taken from a list of TACs identified by each Member State contributing to the pool as listed in the Appendix to Annex IA.\n5.   Those quotas shall be of equivalent commercial value by using a market exchange rate or other mutually acceptable exchange rates. In absence of alternatives, the equivalent economic value in accordance to the average Union prices of the previous year, as provided by the European Market Observatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture Products, shall be used.\n6.   In cases where the above mechanism does not allow Member States to cover their unavoidable by-catches to a similar extent, Member States shall endeavour to agree on quota exchanges pursuant to Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, ensuring that quotas exchanged are of equivalent commercial value.\nArticle 9\nFishing effort limits\nFor the periods referred to in point (b) of Article 1(2), the following fishing effort measures shall apply:\n(a)\nAnnex IIA for the recovery of hake and Norway lobster in ICES divisions 8c and 9a, with the exception of the Gulf of Cádiz;\n(b)\nAnnex IIB for the management of the sole stock in ICES division 7e.\nArticle 10\nMeasures on European seabass fisheries\n1.

It shall be prohibited to retain on board, tranship, relocate or land European seabass caught in that area.\n2.   By derogation from paragraph 1, in January 2019 and from 1 April to 31 December 2019, Union fishing vessels in ICES divisions 4b, 4c, 7d, 7e, 7f and 7h and in waters within 12 nautical miles from baselines under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom in ICES divisions 7a and 7g may fish for European seabass, and retain on board, tranship, relocate or land European seabass caught in that area with the following gears and within the following limits:\n(a)\nusing demersal trawls (29), for unavoidable by-catches not exceeding 400 kilogrammes per two months and 1 % of the weight of the total catches of marine organisms on board caught by that vessel in any single day;\n(b)\nusing seines (30), for unavoidable by-catches not exceeding 210 kilogrammes per month and 1 % of the weight of the total catches of marine organisms on board caught by that vessel in any single day;\n(c)\nusing hooks and lines (31), not exceeding 5,5 tonnes per vessel per year;\n(d)\nusing fixed gillnets (32), for unavoidable by-catches not exceeding 1,4 tonnes per vessel per year.\nThe derogations set out in the first subparagraph shall apply to Union fishing vessels that have recorded catches of European seabass over the period from 1 July 2015 to 30 September 2016: in point (c) with recorded catches using hooks and lines, and in point (d) with recorded catches using fixed gillnets. In the case of a replacement of a Union fishing vessel, Member States may allow the derogation to apply to another fishing vessel provided that the number of Union fishing vessels subject to the derogation and their overall fishing capacity do not increase.\n3.   The catch limits set in paragraph 2 shall not be transferable between vessels and, where a monthly limit applies, from one month to another. For Union fishing vessels using more than one gear in a single calendar month, the lowest catch limit set in paragraph 2 for either gear shall apply.\nMember States shall report to the Commission all catches of European seabass per type of gear not later than 15 days after the end of each month.\n4.   In recreational fisheries, including from shore, in ICES divisions 4b, 4c, 6a, 7a to 7k:\n(a)\nfrom 1 January to 31 March and from 1 November and to 31 December 2019, only catch-and-release fishing allowing high rates of survivability for European seabass shall be allowed. During that period, it shall be prohibited to retain on board, relocate, tranship or land European seabass caught in that area;\n(b)\nfrom 1 April to 31 October 2019, not more than one specimen of European seabass may be retained per fisherman per day.\n5.   In recreational fisheries in ICES divisions 8a and 8b, a maximum of three specimens of European seabass may be retained per fisherman per day.\nArticle 11\nMeasures on European eel fisheries in Union waters of the ICES area\nAny targeted, incidental and recreational fishery of European eel shall be prohibited in Union waters of the ICES area and brackish waters such as estuaries, coastal lagoons and transitional waters for a consecutive three-month period to be determined by each Member State between 1 August 2019 and 29 February 2020. Member States shall communicate the determined period to the Commission not later than 1 June 2019.\nArticle 12\nSpecial provisions on allocations of fishing opportunities\n1.

Through that system it may authorise any vessel concerned by any regulated gear and special conditions as set out in Table I to be present within the area for a maximum number of days which is different from that set out in that Table, provided that the overall amount of kilowatt days corresponding to the regulated gear and to the special conditions is respected.\n7.2.\nThis overall amount of kilowatt days shall be the sum of all individual fishing efforts allocated to the vessels flying the flag of that Member State and qualified for the regulated gear and, where applicable, the special conditions. Such individual fishing efforts shall be calculated in kilowatt days by multiplying the engine power of each vessel by the number of days at sea it would benefit from, according to Table I, if point 7.1. were not applied. For as long as the number of days is unlimited according to Table I, the relevant number of days the vessel would benefit from is 360.\n7.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the system referred to in point 7.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, for the regulated gear and special conditions as laid down in Table I, with reports in electronic format containing the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nthe list of vessels authorised to fish by indicating their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe track record of the years specified in point 6.1.(a) for such vessels reflecting the catch composition defined in the special condition referred to in point 6.1.(a) or (b), if those vessels are qualified for such special conditions;\n(c)\nthe number of days at sea for which each vessel would have initially been authorised to fish according to Table I and the number of days at sea which each vessel would benefit from in application of point 7.1.\n7.4.\nOn the basis of that request, the Commission shall assess whether the conditions referred to in point 7 are complied with and, where applicable, may authorise that Member State to benefit from the system referred to in point 7.1.\n8.   ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR PERMANENT CESSATION OF FISHING ACTIVITIES\n8.1.\nAn additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place during the preceding management period, either in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) or Council Regulation (EC) No 744/2008 (2). Permanent cessations resulting from any other circumstances may be considered by the Commission on a case-by-case basis, following a written and duly motivated request from the Member State concerned. Such written request shall identify the vessels concerned and confirm, for each of them, that they shall never return to fishing activities.\n8.2.\nThe effort expended in 2003 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using the regulated gear shall be divided by the effort expended by all vessels using that gear during 2003. The additional number of days at sea shall be then calculated by multiplying the ratio so obtained by the number of days that would have been allocated according to Table I. Any part of a day resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.\n8.3.\nPoints 8.1. and 8.2. shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point 3 or 6.4., or when the withdrawal has already been used in previous years to obtain additional days at sea.\n8.4.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 8.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, by 15 June of the current management period, with reports in electronic format containing, for the gear grouping and special conditions as laid down in Table I, the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nlists of withdrawn vessels with their CFR and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe fishing activity deployed by such vessels in 2003 calculated in days at sea according to the grouping of fishing gears and, if necessary, special conditions.\n8.5.\nOn the basis of such a request by a Member State the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate that Member State a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5.1. for that Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(2).\n8.6.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may re-allocate those additional days at sea to all or part of the vessels remaining in fleet and qualified for the regulated gears. Additional days stemming from a withdrawn vessel that benefited from a special condition referred to in point 6.1.(a) or (b) may not be allocated to a vessel remaining active that does not benefit from a special condition.\n8.7.\nWhen the Commission allocates additional days at sea due to a permanent cessation of fishing activities during the preceding management period, the maximum number of days per Member State and gear shown in Table I shall be adjusted accordingly for the current management period.\n9.   ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR ENHANCED SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER COVERAGE\n9.1.\nThree additional days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage in partnership between scientists and the fishing industry. Such a programme shall focus in particular on levels of discarding and on catch composition and shall go beyond the requirements on data collection, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/1004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and its implementing rules for national programmes.\n9.2.\nScientific observers shall be independent from the owner, the master of the vessel and any crew member.\n9.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 9.1. shall submit a description of its enhanced scientific observer coverage programme to the Commission for approval.\n9.4.\nOn the basis of that description, and after consultation with the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate the Member State concerned a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5.1. for that Member State and for the vessels, the area and gear concerned by the enhanced programme of scientific observers. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(2).\n9.5.\nIf an enhanced scientific observer coverage programme submitted by a Member State has been approved by the Commission in the past and the Member State concerned wishes to continue its application without changes, it shall inform the Commission of the continuation of that programme four weeks before the beginning of the period for which the programme applies.\nCHAPTER IV\nManagement\n10.   GENERAL OBLIGATION\nMember States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005 and Articles 26 to 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n11.   MANAGEMENT PERIODS\n11.1.\nA Member State may divide the days present within the area set out in Table I into management periods of durations of one or more calendar months.\n11.2.\nThe number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed by the Member State concerned.\n11.3.\nWhere a Member State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within the area by hours, the Member State shall continue measuring the consumption of days as specified in point 10. Upon request by the Commission, the Member State shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of days within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a 24-hour period.\nCHAPTER V\nExchanges of fishing effort allocations\n12.   TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF A MEMBER STATE\n12.1.\nA Member State may permit any fishing vessel flying its flag to transfer days present within the area for which it has been authorised to another vessel flying its flag within the area, provided that the product of the days received by a vessel multiplied by its engine power in kilowatts (kilowatt days) is equal to or less than the product of the days transferred by the donor vessel and the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel. The engine power in kilowatts of the vessels shall be that recorded for each vessel in the Union fishing fleet register.\n12.2.\nThe total number of days present within the area transferred in accordance with point 12.1., multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of the donor vessel, shall not be higher than the donor vessel's average annual days track record in the area as verified by the fishing logbook in the years specified in point 6.1.(a) multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel.\n12.3.\nThe transfer of days as described in point 12.1. shall be permitted between vessels operating with any regulated gear and during the same management period.\n12.4.\nThe transfer of days is only permitted for vessels benefiting from an allocation of fishing days without special conditions.\n12.5.\nOn request from the Commission, Member States shall provide information on the transfers that have taken place. The format of spreadsheets for the collection and transmission of information referred to in this point may be established by the Commission, by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(2).\n13.   TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES\nMember States may permit the transfer of days present within the area for the same management period and within the area between any fishing vessels flying their flags provided that points 4.1. and 4.2. and 12 apply mutatis mutandis. Where Member States decide to authorise such a transfer, they shall notify the Commission, before the transfer takes place, of the details of the transfer, including the number of days to be transferred, the fishing effort and, where applicable, the fishing quotas relating thereto.\nCHAPTER VI\nReporting obligations\n14.   FISHING EFFORT REPORT\nArticle 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 shall apply to vessels falling under the scope of this Annex. The geographical area referred to in that Article shall be understood as the area specified in point 2 of this Annex.\n15.   COLLECTION OF RELEVANT DATA\nMember States shall collect on a quarterly basis the information about total fishing effort deployed within the area for towed gears and static gears, effort deployed by vessels using different types of gear in the area, and the engine power of those vessels in kilowatt days, on the basis of information used for the management of fishing days present within the area as set out in this Annex.\n16.   COMMUNICATION OF RELEVANT DATA\nUpon request from the Commission, Member States shall make available to the Commission a spreadsheet with data specified in point 15 in the format specified in Tables II and III by sending it to the appropriate electronic mailbox address, which shall be communicated to the Member States by the Commission. Member States shall, upon the Commission's request, send detailed information to the Commission on effort allocated and consumed covering all or parts of the current and the precedent management periods, using the data format specified in Tables IV and V.\nTable II\nReporting format kW-day information by management period\nMember State\nGear\nManagement period\nCumulative effort declaration\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nTable III\nData format kW-day information by management period\nName of field\nMaximum number of characters/digits\nAlignment (4)\nL(eft)/R(ight)\nDefinition and comments\n(1)\nMember State\n3\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) in which the vessel is registered\n(2)\nGear\n2\nOne of the following gear types:\nTR = trawls, Danish seines and similar gear ≥ 32 mm\nGN = gillnets ≥ 60 mm\nLL = bottom longlines\n(3)\nManagement period\n4\nOne management period in the period from the 2006 management period to the current management period\n(4)\nCumulative effort declaration\n7\nR\nCumulative amount of fishing effort expressed in kilowatt days deployed from 1 February until 31 January of the relevant management period\nTable IV\nReporting format for vessel-related information\nMember State\nCFR\nExternal marking\nLength of management period\nGear notified\nSpecial condition applying to notified gear(s)\nDays eligible using notified gear(s)\nDays spent with notified gear(s)\nTransfer of days\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(5)\n(5)\n(5)\n(6)\n(6)\n(6)\n(6)\n(7)\n(7)\n(7)\n(7)\n(8)\n(8)\n(8)\n(8)\n(9)\nTable V\nData format for vessel-related information\nName of field\nMaximum number of characters/digits\nAlignment (5)\nL(eft)/R(ight)\nDefinition and comments\n(1)\nMember State\n3\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) in which vessel is registered\n(2)\nCFR\n12\nUnion fishing fleet register number (CFR)\nUnique identification number of a fishing vessel\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) followed by an identifying series (9 characters).

SCOPE\n1.1.\nThis Annex shall apply to Union fishing vessels of 10 metres length overall or more carrying on board or deploying beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm and static nets including gillnets, trammel-nets and tangle-nets with mesh size equal to or less than 220 mm in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 509/2007, and present in ICES division 7e.\n1.2.\nVessels fishing with static nets with mesh size equal to or larger than 120 mm and with track records of less than 300 kg live weight of sole per year during the three previous years, according to their fishing records, shall be exempt from the application of this Annex subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nsuch vessels caught less than 300 kg live weight of sole during the 2017 management period;\n(b)\nsuch vessels do not tranship any fish at sea to another vessel;\n(c)\nby 31 July 2019 and 31 January 2020 each Member State concerned makes a report to the Commission on those vessels' catch records for sole in the three previous years as well as on catches of sole in 2019.\nWhere any of those conditions is not met, the vessels concerned shall cease to be exempt from the application of this Annex, with immediate effect.\n2.   DEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘gear grouping’ means the grouping consisting of the following two gear categories:\n(i)\nbeam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm, and\n(ii)\nstatic nets, including gillnets, trammel nets and tangle-nets, with mesh size equal to or less than 220 mm;\n(b)\n‘regulated gear’ means any of the two gear categories belonging to the gear grouping;\n(c)\n‘area’ means ICES division 7e;\n(d)\n‘current management period’ means the period from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2019.\n3.   LIMITATION IN ACTIVITY\nWithout prejudice to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, each Member State shall ensure that, when carrying on board any regulated gear, Union fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Union shall be present within the area for no more than the number of days set out in Chapter III of this Annex.\nCHAPTER II\nAuthorisations\n4.   AUTHORISED VESSELS\n4.1\nA Member State shall not authorise fishing with regulated gear in the area by any vessel flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity in the area in the period from 2002 to 2017, excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the area.\n4.2\nHowever, a vessel with a track record of using a regulated gear may be authorised to use a different fishing gear, provided that the number of days allocated to this latter gear is greater than or equal to the number of days allocated to the regulated gear.\n4.3\nA vessel flying the flag of a Member State having no quotas in the area shall not be authorised to fish in the area with regulated gear, unless the vessel is allocated a quota after a transfer as permitted in accordance with Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and is allocated days at sea in accordance with point 10 or 11 of this Annex.\nCHAPTER III\nNumber of days present within the area allocated to Union fishing vessels\n5.   MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS\nDuring the current management period, the maximum number of days at sea for which a Member State may authorise a vessel flying its flag to be present within the area having carried on board any regulated gear is shown in Table I.\nTable I\nMaximum number of days a vessel may be present within the area by category of regulated gear per year\nRegulated gear\nMaximum number of days\nBeam trawls of mesh size ≥ 80 mm\nBE\n176\nFR\n188\nUK\n222\nStatic nets with mesh size ≤ 220 mm\nBE\n176\nFR\n191\nUK\n176\n6.   KILOWATT DAY SYSTEM\n6.1.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may manage its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system. Through that system it may authorise any vessel concerned by any regulated gear as set out in Table I to be present within the area for a maximum number of days which is different from that set out in that Table, provided that the overall amount of kilowatt days corresponding to the regulated gear is respected.\n6.2.\nThis overall amount of kilowatt days shall be the sum of all individual fishing efforts allocated to the vessels flying the flag of that Member State and qualified for the regulated gear. Such individual fishing efforts shall be calculated in kilowatt days by multiplying the engine power of each vessel by the number of days at sea it would benefit from, according to Table I, if point 6.1. were not applied.\n6.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the system referred to in point 6.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, for the regulated gear as laid down in Table I, with reports in electronic format containing the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nthe list of vessels authorised to fish by indicating their CFR and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe number of days at sea for which each vessel would have initially been authorised to fish according to Table I and the number of days at sea which each vessel would benefit from in application of point 6.1.\n6.4.\nOn the basis of that request, the Commission shall assess whether the conditions referred to in point 6 are complied with and, where applicable, may authorise that Member State to benefit from the system referred to in point 6.1.\n7.   ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR PERMANENT CESSATION OF FISHING ACTIVITIES\n7.1.\nAn additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place during the preceding management period either in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 or with Regulation (EC) No 744/2008. Permanent cessations resulting from any other circumstances may be considered by the Commission on a case-by-case basis, following a written and duly motivated request from the Member State concerned. Such written request shall identify the vessels concerned and confirm, for each of them, that they shall never return to fishing activities.\n7.2.\nThe effort expended in 2003 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using a given gear grouping shall be divided by the effort expended by all vessels using that gear grouping during 2003. The additional number of days at sea shall be then calculated by multiplying the ratio so obtained by the number of days that would have been allocated according to Table I. Any part of a day resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.\n7.3.\nPoints 7.1.and 7.2. shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point 4.2., or when the withdrawal has already been used in previous years to obtain additional days at sea.\n7.4.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 7.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, by 15 June of the current management period, with reports in electronic format containing for the gear grouping as laid down in Table I, the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nlists of withdrawn vessels with their CFR and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe fishing activity deployed by such vessels in 2003 calculated in days at sea according to the grouping of fishing gears.\n7.5.\nOn the basis of such a request by a Member State the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate that Member State a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5 for that Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(2).\n7.6.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may re-allocate those additional days at sea to all or part of the vessels remaining in fleet and qualified for the regulated gears.\n7.7.\nWhen the Commission allocates additional days at sea due to a permanent cessation of fishing activities during the preceding management period the maximum number of days per Member State and gear shown in Table I shall be adjusted accordingly for the current management period.\n8.   ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR ENHANCED SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER COVERAGE\n8.1.\nThree additional days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated between 1 February 2018 and 31 January 2019 to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage in partnership between scientists and the fishing industry. Such a programme shall focus in particular on levels of discarding and on catch composition and go beyond the requirements on data collection, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/1004 and its implementing rules for national programmes.\n8.2.\nScientific observers shall be independent from the owner, the master of the fishing vessel and any crew member.\n8.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 8.1. shall submit a description of its enhanced scientific observer coverage programme to the Commission for approval.\n8.4.\nOn the basis of that description, and after consultation with STECF, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate the Member State concerned a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5 for that Member State and for the vessels, the area and gear concerned by the enhanced programme of scientific observers. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(2).\n8.5.\nIf an enhanced scientific observer coverage programme submitted by a Member State has been approved by the Commission in the past and the Member State concerned wishes to continue its application without changes, it shall inform the Commission of the continuation of that programme four weeks before the beginning of the period for which the programme applies.\nCHAPTER IV\nManagement\n9.   GENERAL OBLIGATION\nMember States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with Articles 26 to 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n10.   MANAGEMENT PERIODS\n10.1.\nA Member State may divide the days present within the area set out in Table I into management periods of durations of one or more calendar months.\n10.2.\nThe number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed by the Member State concerned.\n10.3.\nWhere a Member State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within the area by hours, the Member State shall continue measuring the consumption of days as specified in point 9. Upon request by the Commission, the Member State shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of days within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a 24-hour period.\nCHAPTER V\nExchanges of fishing effort allocations\n11.   TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF A MEMBER STATE\n11.1.\nA Member State may permit any fishing vessel flying its flag to transfer days present within the area for which it has been authorised to another vessel flying its flag within the area, provided that the product of the days received by a vessel multiplied by its engine power in kilowatts (kilowatt days) is equal to or less than the product of the days transferred by the donor vessel and the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel. The engine power in kilowatts of the vessels shall be that recorded for each vessel in the Union fishing fleet register.\n11.2.\nThe total number of days present within the area transferred in accordance with point 11.1., multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of the donor vessel, shall not be higher than the donor vessel's average annual days track record in the area as verified by the fishing logbook in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel.\n11.3.\nThe transfer of days as described in point 11.1. shall be permitted between vessels operating with any regulated gear and during the same management period.\n11.4.\nOn request from the Commission, Member States shall provide information on the transfers that have taken place. Formats of spreadsheet for the collection and transmission of information referred to in this point may be established by the Commission, by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(2).\n12.   TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES\nMember States may permit transfer of days present within the area for the same management period and within the area between any fishing vessels flying their flags provided that points 4.2., 4.4., 5, 6 and 10 apply mutatis mutandis. Where Member States decide to authorise such a transfer, they shall notify the Commission before the transfer takes place, the details of the transfer, including the number of days to be transferred, the fishing effort and, where applicable, the fishing quotas relating thereto.\nCHAPTER VI\nReporting obligations\n13.   FISHING EFFORT REPORT\nArticle 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 shall apply to vessels falling under the scope of this Annex. The geographical area referred to in that Article shall be understood as the area specified in point 2 of this Annex.\n14.
