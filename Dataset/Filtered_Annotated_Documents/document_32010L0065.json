{"celex_id": "32010L0065", "reference": "29.10.2010\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 283/1\nDIRECTIVE 2010/65/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 October 2010\non reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States and repealing Directive 2002/6/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2002/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 February 2002 on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States of the Community (4) requires Member States to accept certain standardised forms (FAL forms) in order to facilitate traffic, as defined by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (FAL Convention), adopted on 9 April 1965, as amended.\n(2)\nFor the facilitation of maritime transport and in order to reduce the administrative burdens for shipping companies, the reporting formalities required by legal acts of the Union and by Member States need to be simplified and harmonised to the greatest extent possible. However, this Directive should be without prejudice to the nature and content of the information required, and should not introduce any additional reporting requirements for ships not already under such obligation according to legislation applicable in Member States. It should deal solely with how the information procedures can be simplified and harmonised, and how the information could be gathered more effectively.\n(3)\nThe transmission of data required upon arrival in and/or departure from ports under Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2000 on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues (5), Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system (6), Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security (7), Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on port State control (8), and, where appropriate, the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code adopted in 1965, with the amendments thereto adopted and having entered into force, covers the information required by FAL forms. Therefore, where that information corresponds to the requirements in the above-mentioned legal acts, FAL forms should be accepted for providing it.\n(4)\nIn view of the global dimension of maritime transport, legal acts of the Union must take account of IMO requirements if simplification is to take place.\n(5)\nMember States should deepen the cooperation between the competent authorities, such as their customs, border control, public health and transport authorities in order to continue to simplify and harmonise reporting formalities within the Union and make the most efficient use of electronic data transmission and information exchange systems, with a view to the, as far as possible, simultaneous elimination of barriers to maritime transport and the achievement of a European maritime transport space without barriers.\n(6)\nDetailed statistics on maritime transport should be available to assess the efficiency of and the need for policy measures aiming at facilitating maritime traffic within the Union, taking into account the need not to create unnecessary additional requirements with regard to the collection of statistics by the Member States and to make full use of Eurostat. For the purposes of this Directive, it would be important to collect relevant data concerning ship traffic within the Union and/or ships calling at third country ports or in free zones.\n(7)\nIt should be easier for shipping companies to benefit from the status of ‘authorised regular shipping service’ in line with the objective of the Commission communication of 21 January 2009 entitled ‘Communication and action plan with a view to establishing a European maritime transport space without barriers’.\n(8)\nWidespread use should be made of electronic means of data transmission for all reporting formalities as soon as possible and by 1 June 2015 at the latest, building on the international standards developed by the FAL Convention, whenever practicable. In order to streamline and accelerate the transmission of potentially very large amounts of information, electronic formats for reporting formalities should be used, whenever practicable. Within the Union, the provision of information in FAL forms in paper format should be the exception and should be accepted only for a limited period of time. Member States are encouraged to use administrative means, including economic incentives, to promote the use of electronic formats. For the above-mentioned reasons exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States should take place electronically. In order to facilitate such a development, electronic systems need to be technically interoperable to a greater extent and as far as possible by the same deadline to ensure the smooth functioning of the European maritime transport space without barriers.\n(9)\nParties involved in trade and transport should be able to lodge standardised information and documents via an electronic single window to fulfil reporting formalities. Individual data elements should only be submitted once.\n(10)\nThe SafeSeaNet systems established at national and Union level should facilitate the reception, exchange and distribution of information between the information systems of Member States on maritime activity. To facilitate maritime transport and to reduce the administrative burdens for maritime transport, the SafeSeaNet system should be interoperable with other systems of the Union for reporting formalities. The SafeSeaNet system should be used for additional exchange of information for the facilitation of maritime transport. Reporting formalities regarding information for solely national purposes should not need to be introduced in the SafeSeaNet system.\n(11)\nWhen adopting new Union measures, it should be ensured that Member States can maintain the electronic transmission of data and are not required to use paper formats.\n(12)\nThe full benefits of electronic data transmission can only be achieved where there is smooth and effective communication between SafeSeaNet, e-Customs and the electronic systems for entering or calling up data. To that end, in order to limit the administrative burdens, recourse should be had in the first instance to the applicable standards.\n(13)\nFAL forms are regularly updated. This Directive should therefore refer to the version of these forms that is currently in force. Any information required by Member States’ legislation which goes beyond the requirements of the FAL Convention should be communicated in a format to be developed on the basis of FAL Convention standards.\n(14)\nThis Directive should not affect Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (9), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (10), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (11), or national legislation in the area of border control for those Member States which do not apply the Schengen border control acquis, and Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code) (12).\n(15)\nIn the interest of making the electronic transmission of information standard and for the facilitation of maritime transport, Member States should extend the use of electronic means of transmitting data according to an adequate timetable, and should, in cooperation with the Commission, discuss the possibility of harmonising the use of electronic means of transmitting data. To this end, consideration should be given to the work of the High Level Steering Group for the SafeSeaNet system as regards the SafeSeaNet road map, when adopted, and to the concrete funding requirements and respective allocation of Union financial means for the development of electronic transmission of data.\n(16)\nShips operating between ports situated in the customs territory of the Union should be exempt from the obligation to send the information referred to in the FAL forms, where the ships do not come from, call at or are headed towards a port situated outside that territory or a free zone subject to type I controls within the meaning of customs legislation, without prejudice to the applicable legal acts of the Union and the information Member States may request in order to protect internal order and security and to enforce customs, fiscal, immigration, environmental or sanitary laws.\n(17)\nExemptions from administrative formalities should also be permitted on the basis of the ship’s cargo, not merely on the basis of its destination and/or place of departure. This is necessary to ensure that additional formalities for ships that have called at a port in a third country or a free zone are minimised. The Commission should examine this issue within the framework of the report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of this Directive.\n(18)\nA new temporary form should be introduced in order to harmonise the information required for the prior Declaration of Security provided for by Regulation (EC) No 725/2004.\n(19)\nNational language requirements are often an obstacle to the development of the coastal shipping network. The Member States should make all possible efforts to facilitate written and oral communication in maritime traffic between Member States, in accordance with international practice, with a view to finding common means of communication.\n(20)\nThe Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of the Annex to this Directive. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(21)\nThe various legal acts of the Union requiring, for example, pre-notification formalities at the entry into ports, such as Directive 2009/16/EC, may impose different time limits for the accomplishment of these pre-notification formalities. The Commission should examine the possibility of shortening and harmonising these time-limits, taking advantage of ongoing progress in electronic data processing in the framework of the report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of this Directive which should contain, if appropriate, a legislative proposal.\n(22)\nWithin the framework of the report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of this Directive, the Commission should consider how far the purpose of this Directive, namely the simplification of administrative formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States, should be extended to the areas inland of those ports, particularly to river transport, with a view to the quicker and smoother movement of maritime traffic inland and a lasting solution to congestion in and around seaports.\n(23)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, in particular to facilitate maritime transport in a harmonised way across the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may take measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(24)\nAccording to the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, where transposition of a directive is pointless for reasons of geography, this transposition is not mandatory. Therefore, requirements foreseen in this Directive are not relevant for Member States which do not have any ports at which ships falling under the scope of this Directive normally can call.\n(25)\nThe measures stipulated in this Directive help achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda.\n(26)\nAccess to SafeSeaNet and to other electronic systems should be regulated in order to protect commercial and confidential information and without prejudice to the applicable law on the protection of commercial data and, in respect of personal data, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (13) and to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (14). The Member States and the Union institutions and bodies should pay particular attention to the need to protect commercial and confidential information through appropriate access control systems.\n(27)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (15), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Union, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(28)\nIn the interest of clarity, Directive 2002/6/EC should be replaced by this Directive,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   The purpose of this Directive is to simplify and harmonise the administrative procedures applied to maritime transport by making the electronic transmission of information standard and by rationalising reporting formalities.\n2.

The master, or any other person duly authorised by the operator of the ship, must provide the competent national authority with notification, prior to arriving in an EU port, of the information required under the reporting formalities.\nElectronic transmission of data\nEU countries:\nhad to accept the electronic submission of reporting formalities via a single window at the latest by 1 June 2015; this national single window is the place where all information is reported once and made available to various competent authorities and the EU countries;\nmust ensure that information received in accordance with reporting formalities is made available in their national SafeSeaNet systems and make available parts of such information to other EU countries via the SafeSeaNet system;\nmust accept FAL forms (special forms developed by the International Maritime Organization for the facilitation of international maritime traffic) for the fulfilment of reporting formalities and they were still able to accept information provided in paper format until 1 June 2015.\nExemptions\nShips which are within the scope of Directive 2002/59/EC (see summary) and which operate between ports situated in the customs territory of the EU, without coming from, calling at or heading towards a port outside the EU, are exempt from the obligation to provide the information.\nAmendments\nAmending Directive (EU) 2017/2109 introduced new rules which aim at digitalising the registration of persons sailing on board passengers ships. It seeks to ensure the immediate availability of the exact number of passengers and other information for the use of the search and rescue (SAR) services in the event of an accident. Under the new requirements, the number of persons on board has to be communicated by means of either the national single windows or, where an EU country so chooses, to the designated authority by means of the automatic identification system* before the ship’s departure.\nDirective (EU) 2019/883 on port reception facilities for the delivery of waste from ships amends the annex to Directive 2010/65/EU regarding the information to be provided to the authorities concerning waste from ships, including residues.\nRepeal\nDirective 2010/65/EU is repealed by Regulation (EU) 2019/1239 on a European Maritime Single Window environment as of 15 August 2025. The new regulation establishes a framework for a technologically neutral and interoperable European Maritime Single Window environment (EMSWe) with harmonised interfaces to facilitate the electronic transmission of information in relation to reporting obligations for ships arriving at, staying in and departing from EU ports.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nThe directive has applied in the EU countries since 19 May 2012 and it had to become law in the EU countries on the same date.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEuropean Maritime Single Window environment (European Commission)\nFollowing the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:\nCommunication from the Commission — Guidelines on protection of health, repatriation and travel arrangements for seafarers, passengers and other persons on board ships.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAutomatic Identification System: a maritime broadcast system, based on the transmission of very high frequency (VHF) radio signals. Ships send reports with ship identification, position, and course, as well as information on cargo. In EU, Icelandic and Norwegian waters, the exchange of AIS messages is done through the SafeSeaNet system.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States and repealing Directive 2002/6/EC (OJ L 283, 29.10.2010, pp. 1-10)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2010/65/EU have been incorporated into the original document.
