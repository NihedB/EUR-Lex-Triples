whereas this necessitates the establishment of complete, reliable and comparable statistical sources at national and regional level; whereas the levels of breakdown to be applied to the variables are limited to what is necessary to ensure comparability with previous statistics and compatibility with national accounts requirements;Whereas the European Central Bank (ECB) needs information on the level and composition of labour costs and on the structure and distribution of earnings in order to assess the economic development in the Member States in the context of a single European monetary policy;Whereas statistical information in this field is available only in certain Member States and valid comparisons cannot therefore be made; whereas Community statistics should consequently be produced and the results processed on the basis of common definitions and harmonised methodologies, taking into account the standards approved by relevant international organisations;Whereas presently not all Member States collect complete data in sections M (Education), N (Health and social work) and O (Other Community, social and personal service activities); whereas it is therefore appropriate to decide on their possible inclusion in the scope of this Regulation in the light of a report to be submitted by the Commission on the basis of pilot studies on the feasibility of collecting complete data in these sectors;Whereas although the importance of complete data of all segments of the economy should be fully recognised, it should be carefully weighed against the reporting possibilities and the response burden in specific areas, in particular in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); whereas it is therefore appropriate for the Commission to carry out pilot studies on the feasibility of collecting complete data from statistical units with less than ten employees and that the Council decides on this matter in the light of a report to be submitted by the Commission, within four years of the entry into force of this Regulation; whereas the use of administrative records may be helpful in the meanwhile and should be encouraged;Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the creation of common statistical standards enabling harmonised information to be produced is a proposed action the objectives of which can, by reason of its scale or effects be better achieved by the Community; whereas these standards will be implemented in each Member State on the authority of the agencies and institutions appointed to compile Community statistics;Whereas it seems appropriate to make provisions for exceptions for certain Member States, in order to take account of particular technical difficulties encountered by such States in the collection of certain types of information, provided that the quality of the statistical information is not seriously affected;Whereas the production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (4);Whereas the Statistical Programme Committee established by Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (5) has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of the aforesaid Decision,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1 General provisions The national authorities and Eurostat shall produce Community statistics on the level and composition of labour costs and on the structure and distribution of employees' earnings, in the economic activities defined in Article 3.Article 2 Reference period 1.
