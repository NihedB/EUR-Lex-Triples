This Regulation lays down the conditions for exporting foodstuffs and feedingstuffs after a nuclear accident or any other radiological situation likely to lead to significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.\n2.   For the purposes of this Regulation ‘foodstuffs’ means products which are intended for human consumption either immediately or after processing, and ‘feedingstuffs’ means products which are intended only for animal nutrition.\nArticle 2\nFoodstuffs and feedingstuffs in which the level of radioactive contamination exceeds the relevant maximum permitted levels laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 may not be exported.\nArticle 3\nThe Member States shall carry out checks to ensure that the maximum permitted levels referred to in Article 2 are observed.\nArticle 4\nEach Member State shall communicate to the Commission the fullest information on the application of this Regulation, and in particular on any cases where the maximum permitted levels have been exceeded. The Commission shall forward this information to the other Member States.\nArticle 5\nThe rules of application for this Regulation shall be laid down by the Commission in accordance with the procedure defined in Article 7 of Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87. To this end an ad hoc Committee shall be set up.\nArticle 6\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 18 July 1989.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nR.
