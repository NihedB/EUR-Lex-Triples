The protection concerns:\ninternational trade; and/or\nthe movement of capital; and\nrelated commercial activities between the EU and non-EU countries.\nThe regulation applies to:\nany individual who is a resident in the EU and a national of an EU country;\nany legal entity incorporated within the EU;\nnationals of EU countries who are established outside the EU and shipping companies established outside the EU and controlled by nationals of an EU country (for example a French person working in a Dutch-owned shipping company in a non-EU country), if their vessels are registered in that country in accordance with its legislation;\nindividuals who are a resident in the EU, unless that person is in the country of which he or she is a national;\nany other individual within the EU, including its territorial waters and airspace and in any aircraft or on any vessel under the jurisdiction or control of an EU country, acting in a professional capacity.\nAny person whose economic and financial interests are affected by foreign legislation must inform the European Commission within 30 days. This 30-day period runs from the date on which the person obtained this information.If a court or tribunal or an administrative authority located outside the EU handed down a decision giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the laws specified in the annex (such as the US’s ‘Iran Sanctions Act of 1996’), this decision would not be recognised or enforceable in any manner. The persons referred to in this regulation shall not comply with any requirement or prohibition based on the laws specified in the annex. Nonetheless, a person may be authorised to comply fully or partially with the said requirements or prohibitions to the extent that non-compliance would seriously damage their interests or those of the EU. This authorisation is granted by the Commission, which is assisted by a committee composed of representatives of the EU countries.The EU countries determine the sanctions to be imposed in the event of a breach of any relevant provisions of this regulation.\nAmendments to the regulation\nRegulation (EU) No 37/2014 empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts. It also states that Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 requires uniform conditions for establishing criteria for the authorisation of persons to comply fully or partially with any requirement or prohibition, including requests of foreign courts, in cases where non-compliance would seriously damage their interests or those of the EU. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. (Committees’ role in European Commission’s implementing powers).\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1100 amends the annex to take into account the fact that in May 2018, the US announced they will no longer waive their national restrictive measures relating to Iran. Some of those measures have extra-territorial effect and may have adverse consequences for the interests of the EU and the interests of natural and legal persons engaged in economic activities with Iran.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 29 November 1996.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of 22 November 1996 protecting against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country, and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom (OJ L 309, 29.11.1996, pp. 1-6)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 have been incorporated in the basic text.
