For the purposes of this paragraph, \"interested party\" means any Member State of WIPO whose official language, or one of whose official languages, is involved and the European Community, and any other intergovernmental organisation that may become Party to this Treaty, if one of its official languages is involved.Article 33DepositaryThe Director-General of WIPO is the depositary of this Treaty.Agreed statementsConcerning Article 1(2)It is understood that Article 1(2) clarifies the relationship between rights in phonograms under this Treaty and copyright in works embodied in the phonograms. In cases where authorisation is needed from both the author of a work embodied in the phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorisation of the author does not cease to exist because the authorisation of the performer or producer is also required, and vice versa.It is further understood that nothing in article 1(2) precludes a Contracting Party from providing exclusive rights to a performer or producer of phonograms beyond those required to be provided under this Treaty.Concerning Article 2(b)It is understood that the definition of phonogram provided in Article 2(b) does not suggest that rights in the phonogram are in any way affected through their incorporation into a cinematographic or other audiovisual work.Concerning Articles 2(e), 8, 9, 12 and 13As used in these Articles, the expressions \"copies\" and \"original and copies\" being subject to the right of distribution and the right of rental under the said Articles, refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects.Concerning Article 3(2)For the application of Article 3(2), it is understood that fixation means the finalisation of the master tape (\"bande-mère\").Concerning Article 3It is understood that the reference in Articles 5(a) and 16(a)(iv) of the Rome Convention to \"national of another Contracting state\" will, when applied to this Treaty, mean, in regard to an intergovernmental organisation that is a Contracting Party to this Treaty, a national of one of the countries that is a member of that organisation.Concerning Articles 7, 11 and 16The reproduction right, as set out in Articles 7 and 11, and the exceptions permitted thereunder through Article 16, fully apply in the digital environment, in particular to the use of performances and phonograms in digital form. It is understood that the storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes a reproduction within the meaning of these Articles.Concerning Article 15It is understood that Article 15 does not represent a complete resolution of the level of rights of broadcasting and communication to the public that should be enjoyed by performers and phonogram producers in the digital age. Delegations were unable to achieve consensus on differing proposals for aspects of exclusivity to be provided in certain circumstances or for rights to be provided without the possibility of reservations, and have therefore left the issue so future resolution.Concerning Article 15It is understood that Article 15 does not prevent the granting of the right conferred by this Article to performers of folklore and producers of phonograms recording folklore where such phonograms have not been published for commercial gain.Concerning Article 16The agreed statement concerning Article 10 (on limitations and exceptions of the WIPO Copyright Treaty is applicable mutatis mutandis also to Article 16 (on limitations and exceptions) of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.Concerning Article 19The agreed statement concerning Article 12 (on obligations concerning rights management information) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty is applicable mutatis mutandis also to Article 19 (on obligations concerning rights management information) of the WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty.", "summary": "Accession to the World Intellectual Property Organisation treaties\nAccession to the World Intellectual Property Organisation treaties\nSUMMARY OF:\nDecision 2000/278/EC approving the World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty and the World Intellectual Property Organisation Performances and Phonograms Treaty on behalf of the EU\nWorld Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty — Joint declarations\nWorld Intellectual Property Organisation Performances and Phonograms Treaty — Joint declarations\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION AND OF THE TREATIES?\n              \nThe decision approves 2 treaties concluded in December 1996 on behalf of the European Community (now the EU). The treaties in question are the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT).\nThe aim of the WCT and the WPPT, also known as the WIPO ‘internet’ treaties, is to adapt the international protection of copyright and related rights to the internet age by supplementing the content of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.\nKEY POINTS\nWCT\nUnder this treaty, authors are provided with the exclusive rights of distribution and rental and with a broader right of communication to the public of their works in the digital environment. Computer programs are protected as literary works and the arrangement or selection of data or other material in databases is also protected. Specific protection is also provided for technological measures and electronic rights management information used to identify and manage works.\nWPPT\nThis treaty concerns related rights and improves the protection of artists/performers and producers of phonograms (i.e. recordings), particularly in the digital environment. They enjoy exclusive rights for the reproduction, distribution, rental and making available to the public of their performances and phonograms. They also receive a right to equitable remuneration for broadcasting or for any communication to the public of their phonograms published for commercial purposes.\nAccession of the EU\nIn its decision of 16 March 2000, the Council approved the 2 treaties on behalf of the EU and authorised the European Commission to represent the EU at the meetings of the Assemblies referred to in the treaties. According to this decision, the position of the EU will be prepared by the relevant Council working party. For the first time, the EU became party to WIPO treaties in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE TREATIES APPLY?\n              \nThese treaties entered into force 3 months after 30 instruments of ratification or accession by states were submitted to the WIPO.\nThe EU’s instruments of ratification were deposited by the EU and the EU countries on 14 December 2009 after all the EU countries had incorporated into their national law Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright and related rights in the information society, which adapted EU legislation to the content of the treaties.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe conventions of Paris (protection of industrial property, 1883) and Berne (protection of literary and artistic works, 1886) form the basis of the WIPO treaties. Subsequent treaties extended the protection offered to other subject matters (e.g. performance, phonograms) by taking account of technical developments and new fields of interest (e.g. the information society).\nThe last WIPO treaty ratified by the EU (in 2018) is the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled. Its aim is to improve the availability and cross-border exchange of certain works and other protected subject matter in accessible formats for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. Parties to the treaty have the freedom to implement its provisions, taking into account their own legal systems and practices, complying with the obligations set out in the Berne Convention.\nFor more information, see:\nWIPO-Administered Treaties (WIPO).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2000/278/EC of 16 March 2000 on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (OJ L 89, 11.4.2000, pp. 6-7)\nWIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) — Joint declarations (OJ L 89, 11.4.2000, pp. 8-14)\nWIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) — Joint declarations (OJ L 89, 11.4.2000, pp. 15-23)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nMarrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled (OJ L 48, 21.2.2018, pp. 3-11)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2018/254 of 15 February 2018 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled (OJ L 48, 21.2.2018, p. 1-2)\nDirective 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (OJ L 167, 22.6.2001, pp. 10-19)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2001/29/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
