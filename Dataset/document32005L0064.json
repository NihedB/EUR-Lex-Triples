Therefore vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers should be requested to include those aspects at the earliest stages of the development of new vehicles, in order to facilitate the treatment of vehicles at the time when they reach the end of their life.\n(3)\nThis Directive constitutes one of the separate directives within the framework of the Community whole vehicle type-approval system established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (4).\n(4)\nThat whole vehicle type-approval system is currently compulsory for vehicles belonging to category M1 and will be extended, in the near future, to all categories of vehicle. It is therefore necessary to include in the whole vehicle type-approval system those measures concerning the re-usability, recyclability and recoverability of vehicles.\n(5)\nAccordingly, it is necessary to lay down provisions to take into account the fact that N1 vehicles are not yet covered by the whole vehicle type-approval system.\n(6)\nThe manufacturer should make available to the approval authority all relevant technical information as regards constituent materials and their respective masses in order to permit verification of the manufacturer's calculations in accordance with the standard ISO 22628: 2002.\n(7)\nThe manufacturer's calculations can be properly validated at the time of the vehicle type-approval only if the manufacturer has put in place satisfactory arrangements and procedures to manage all information he receives from his suppliers. Before any type-approval can be granted, the competent body should carry out a preliminary assessment of those arrangements and procedures and should issue a certificate indicating that they are satisfactory.\n(8)\nThe relevance of the different inputs in the calculations of the recyclability and recoverability rates has to be assessed in accordance with the processes for treatment of end-of-life vehicles. The manufacturer should therefore recommend a strategy for the treatment of end-of-life vehicles and should provide details thereof to the competent body. This strategy should be based on proven technologies, which are available or in development at the time of applying for the vehicle approval.\n(9)\nSpecial-purpose vehicles are designed to perform a specific function and require special bodywork arrangements which are not entirely under the control of the manufacturer. Consequently, the recyclability and recoverability rates cannot be calculated properly. Those vehicles should therefore be excluded from the requirements concerning calculation.\n(10)\nIncomplete vehicles constitute a significant proportion of N1 vehicles. The manufacturer of the base vehicle is not in a position to calculate the recyclability and recoverability rates for completed vehicles because the data concerning the later stages of construction are not available at the design stage of the base vehicles. It is therefore appropriate to require only the base vehicle to comply with this Directive.\n(11)\nThe market shares of vehicles produced in small series are very limited, so that there will be little benefit to the environment if they have to comply with this Directive. It is therefore appropriate to exclude them from certain provisions of this Directive.\n(12)\nIn accordance with Directive 2000/53/EC, appropriate measures should be taken, in the interests of road safety and protection of the environment, to prevent the reuse of certain component parts which have been removed from end-of-life vehicles. Such measures should be restricted to the reuse of parts in the construction of new vehicles.\n(13)\nThe provisions set out in this Directive will impose on manufacturers the supply of new data relating to type-approval and therefore these particulars should be reflected in Directive 70/156/EEC, which establishes the exhaustive list of data to be submitted for type-approval. It is therefore necessary to amend that Directive accordingly.\n(14)\nThe measures necessary for the adaptation to scientific and technical progress of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure provided for in Article 13(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC.\n(15)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to minimise the impact of end-of-life vehicles on the environment by requiring that vehicles be designed from the conception phase with a view to facilitating reuse, recycling and recovery, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone and can, therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.\n(16)\nIn accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (5), Member States will be encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down the administrative and technical provisions for the type-approval of vehicles covered by Article 2, with a view to ensuring that their component parts and materials can be reused, recycled and recovered in the minimum percentages set out in Annex I.\nIt lays down specific provisions to ensure that the re-use of component parts does not give rise to safety or environmental hazards.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Directive shall apply to vehicles belonging to categories M1 and N1, as defined in Part A of Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC, and to new or reused component parts of such vehicles.\nArticle 3\nExemptions\nWithout prejudice to the application of the provisions of Article 7, this Directive shall not apply to:\n(a)\nspecial purpose vehicles as defined in part A, point 5, of Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC;\n(b)\nmulti-stage built vehicles belonging to category N1, provided that the base vehicle complies with this Directive;\n(c)\nvehicles produced in small series, referred to in Article 8(2)(a) of Directive 70/156/EEC.\nArticle 4\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘vehicle’ means a motor vehicle;\n2.\n‘component part’ means any part or any assembly of parts which is included in a vehicle at the time of its production.

The aim is to reduce waste from what are known as end-of-life vehicles.\nACT\n                  \nDirective 2005/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their reusability, recyclability and recoverability and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE DO?\n                     \nIt lays down administrative and technical rules to ensure that a vehicle’s parts and materials may ultimately be reused, recycled and recovered as much as possible. It makes sure that the reused components do not cause any safety or environmental risks.\nKEY POINTS\nThis European Union (EU) legislation applies to new models and models already being produced of cars, station wagons, people carriers and light commercial vehicles (e.g. vans).\nNew vehicles may only be sold in the EU if they may be reused and/or recycled to a minimum of 85 % by mass or reused and/or recovered to a minimum of 95 % by mass.\nManufacturers must have strategies in place to properly manage the reusability, recyclability and recoverability requirements of the legislation.\nIf national authorities consider these strategies satisfactory, the manufacturer receives a certificate of compliance. This is valid for at least 2 years.\nThe reuse of certain component parts, such as airbags, seat belts and steering locks, is banned and may not be used in new vehicles since they could present safety and environmental risks.\nThe legislation does not apply to special purpose vehicles such as armoured cars and ambulances or vehicles produced in small series defined as fewer than 500 vehicles of one family of types sold per year in each EU country.\nSeparate legislation sets out measures to prevent and limit waste from end-of-life vehicles and their components and ensures that wherever possible this is reused, recycled or recovered.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nEvery year, end-of-life vehicles create between 8 and 9 million tonnes of waste in the EU.\nFor more information, see end-of-life vehicles on the European Commission’s website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2005/64/EC\n15.12.2005\n15.12.2006\nOJ L 310 of 25.11.2005, pp. 10-27\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2009/1/EC\n3.2.2009\n-\nOJ L 9 of 14.1.2009, pp. 31-32\nlast update 25.08.2015", "tags": ["motor vehicle industry", "spare part", "waste recycling", "motor vehicle", "commercial vehicle", "Community certification"], "subjects": ["Transport", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Technical barriers", "Approximation of laws"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32005L0064_p1": {"text": "directive 2005/64/ec OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 26 October 2005---on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their reusability, recyclability and recoverability and amending Council directive 70/156/eec", "triples": [" directive 2005/64/ec,  amending,  directive 70/156/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32005L0064_p1": {"text": "directive 2005/64/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their reusability, recyclability and recoverability and amending Council directive 70/156/eec", "triples": [" directive 2005/64/ec,  amending,  directive 70/156/eec"]}}}
