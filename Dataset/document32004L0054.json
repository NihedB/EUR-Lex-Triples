{"celex_id": "32004L0054", "reference": "30.4.2004\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 167/39\nDIRECTIVE 2004/54/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 29 April 2004\non minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn its White Paper of 12 September 2001 on \"European transport policy for 2010: time to decide\" the Commission announced that it would propose minimum safety requirements for tunnels belonging to the Trans-European Road Network.\n(2)\nThe transport system, notably the Trans-European Road Network defined in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (4), is of paramount importance in supporting European integration and ensuring a high level of well-being among Europe's citizens. The European Community has the responsibility of guaranteeing a high, uniform and constant level of security, service and comfort on the Trans-European Road Network.\n(3)\nLong tunnels of over 500 m in length are important structures which facilitate communication between large areas of Europe and play a decisive role in the functioning and development of regional economies.\n(4)\nThe European Council has on several occasions, and notably at its meeting on 14 and 15 December 2001 in Laeken, underlined the urgency of taking measures to improve tunnel safety.\n(5)\nOn 30 November 2001, the Transport Ministers of Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland met in Zurich and adopted a Common Declaration recommending the alignment of national legislations on the most recent harmonised requirements for improving safety in long tunnels.\n(6)\nSince the objective of the proposed action, namely the achievement of a uniform, constant and high level of protection for all European citizens in road tunnels, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the level of harmonisation required, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(7)\nRecent accidents in tunnels emphasise their importance in human, economic and cultural terms.\n(8)\nSome tunnels in Europe, put into operation a long time ago, were designed at a time when technical possibilities and transport conditions were very different from those of today. There are thus disparate safety levels and this must be rectified.\n(9)\nSafety in tunnels requires a number of measures relating, amongst other things, to the geometry of the tunnel and its design, safety equipment, including road signs, traffic management, training of the emergency services, incident management, the provision of information to users on how best to behave in tunnels, and better communication between the authorities in charge and emergency services such as the police, fire-brigades and rescue teams.\n(10)\nAs the work of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has already made clear, the conduct of road users is a decisive aspect of tunnel safety.\n(11)\nSafety measures should enable people involved in incidents to rescue themselves, allow road users to act immediately so as to prevent more serious consequences, ensure that emergency services can act effectively and protect the environment as well as limit material damage.\n(12)\nThe improvements brought about by this Directive will improve safety conditions for all users, including disabled persons. However, as disabled persons have more difficulty in escaping in an emergency, particular consideration should be given to their safety.\n(13)\nIn order to implement a balanced approach and due to the high cost of the measures, minimum safety equipment should be defined taking into account the type and the expected traffic volume of each tunnel.\n(14)\nInternational bodies such as the World Road Association and the UNECE have for a long time been making invaluable recommendations to help improve and harmonise safety equipment and traffic rules in road tunnels. However, as these recommendations are not binding, their full potential can only be maximised if the requirements they identify are made mandatory through legislation.\n(15)\nMaintaining a high safety level requires proper maintenance of the safety facilities in tunnels. An exchange of information on modern safety techniques and accident/incident data between the Member States should be systematically organised.\n(16)\nIn order to ensure that the requirements of this Directive are properly applied by Tunnel Managers, Member States should designate one or more authorities at national, regional or local level with responsibility for ensuring that all aspects of tunnel safety are assured.\n(17)\nA flexible and progressive timetable is needed for implementation of this Directive. This will allow for completion of the most urgent works without creating major disturbances in the transport system or bottlenecks in public works in the Member States.\n(18)\nThe cost of refurbishing existing tunnels varies considerably from one Member State to another, particularly for geographical reasons, and Member States should be allowed to stagger any refurbishment works needed to meet the requirements of this Directive where the density of tunnels on their territory is well in excess of the European average.\n(19)\nFor tunnels already in operation or tunnels whose design has been approved but which have not been opened to the public within 24 months following the entry into force of this Directive, Member States should be allowed to accept the adoption of risk reduction measures as an alternative to application of the requirements of the Directive, where the tunnel does not allow for structural solutions to be implemented at reasonable cost.\n(20)\nFurther technical progress is still necessary to improve tunnel safety. A procedure should be introduced to allow the Commission to adapt the requirements of this Directive to technical progress. That procedure should also be used to adopt a harmonised risk analysis method.\n(21)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (5).\n(22)\nMember States should submit a report to the Commission on the measures they plan to adopt to meet the requirements of this Directive, with a view to synchronising works at Community level in order to reduce traffic disturbances,\n(23)\nWhere the requirements of this Directive necessitate the construction of a second tube for a tunnel in the design or construction phase, this second tube to be constructed should be considered as a new tunnel. The same applies if the requirements of this Directive necessitate the opening of new legally binding planning procedures, including planning permission hearings for all related measures.\n(24)\nWork should continue in the appropriate fora in order to arrive at a large degree of harmonisation as regards the signs and pictogrammes used on variable message signs in tunnels. Member States should be encouraged to harmonise the user interface for all tunnels on their territory.\n(25)\nMember States should be encouraged to implement comparable safety levels for road tunnels located in their territory that do not form part of the Trans-European Road Network and consequently do not fall within the scope of this Directive.\n(26)\nMember States should be encouraged to develop national provisions aiming at a higher tunnel safety level,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Directive aims at ensuring a minimum level of safety for road users in tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network by the prevention of critical events that may endanger human life, the environment and tunnel installations, as well as by the provision of protection in case of accidents.\n2.   It shall apply to all tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network with lengths of over 500 m, whether they are in operation, under construction or at the design stage.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n1)\n\"Trans-European Road Network\" means the road network identified in Section 2 of Annex I to Decision No 1692/96/EC and illustrated by maps and/or described in Annex II to that Decision.\n2)\n\"Emergency services\" means all local services, whether public or private or part of the tunnel staff, which intervene in the event of an accident, including police services, fire brigades and rescue teams.\n3)\n\"Tunnel length\" means the length of the longest traffic lane, measured on the fully enclosed part of the tunnel.\nArticle 3\nSafety Measures\n1.   Member States shall ensure that tunnels in their territory, falling within the scope of this Directive meet the minimum safety requirements laid down in Annex I.\n2.   Where certain structural requirements laid down in Annex I can only be satisfied through technical solutions which either cannot be achieved or can be achieved only at disproportionate cost, the Administrative Authority as referred to in Article 4 may accept the implementation of risk reduction measures as an alternative to application of those requirements, provided that the alternative measures will result in equivalent or improved protection. The efficiency of these measures shall be demonstrated through a risk analysis in conformity with the provisions of Article 13. Member States shall inform the Commission of the risk reduction measures accepted as an alternative and provide justification therefor. This paragraph shall not apply to runnels at the design stage as referred to in Article 9.\n3.   Member States may specify stricter requirements, provided that they do not contravene the requirements of this Directive.\nArticle 4\nAdministrative Authority\n1.   Member States shall designate (an) administrative authority(ies), hereinafter referred to as \"the Administrative Authority\", which shall have responsibility for ensuring that all aspects of the safety of a tunnel are assured and which shall take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with this Directive.\n2.   The Administrative Authority may be set up at national, regional or local level.\n3.   Each tunnel in the Trans-European Road Network located on the territory of a single Member State shall fall under the responsibility of a single Administrative Authority. For each tunnel located on the territory of two Member States, each Member State shall designate an Administrative Authority or, alternatively, the two Member States shall designate a joint Administrative Authority. If there are two different Administrative Authorities, the decisions of either taken in the exercise of its respective competencies and responsibilities with regard to tunnel safety shall be adopted with the prior agreement of the other Authority.\n4.   The Administrative Authority shall commission tunnels in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex II.\n5.   Without prejudice to further arrangements on this subject at national level, the Administrative Authority shall have power to suspend or restrict the operation of a tunnel if safety requirements are not met. It shall specify the conditions under which normal traffic may be resumed.\n6.   The Administrative Authority shall ensure that the following tasks are performed:\n(a)\ntesting and inspecting tunnels on a regular basis and drawing up safety requirements pertaining thereto;\n(b)\nputting in place organisational and operational schemes (including emergency response plans) for the training and equipping of emergency services;\n(c)\ndefining the procedure for immediate closure of a tunnel in an emergency;\n(d)\nimplementing the necessary risk reduction measures.\n7.   Where bodies designated as Administrative Authorities existed prior to the designation referred to in this Article, those Administrative Authorities may continue their previous activities provided that they comply with this Directive.\nArticle 5\nTunnel Manager\n1.   For each tunnel located on the territory of one Member State, whether it is in the design, construction or operating stage, the Administrative Authority shall identify as Tunnel Manager the public or private body responsible for the management of the tunnel at the stage in question. The Administrative Authority itself may perform this function.\n2.   For each tunnel located on the territory of two Member States, the two Administrative Authorities or the joint Administrative Authority shall recognise only one body in charge of the operation of the tunnel.\n3.   Any significant incident or accident occurring in a tunnel shall be the subject of an incident report prepared by the Tunnel Manager. This report shall be forwarded to the Safety Officer referred to in Article 6, to the Administrative Authority and to the emergency services within a maximum period of one month.\n4.   Where an investigation report is drawn up analysing the circumstances of the incident or accident referred to in paragraph 3 or the conclusions that can be drawn from it, the Tunnel Manager shall forward this report to the Safety Officer, the Administrative Authority and the emergency services no later than one month after he receives it himself.\nArticle 6\nSafety Officer\n1.   For each tunnel, the Tunnel Manager shall, with the prior approval of the Administrative Authority, nominate one Safety Officer who shall coordinate all preventive and safeguards measures to ensure the safety of users and operational staff. The Safety Officer may be a member of the tunnel staff or the emergency services, shall be independent in all road tunnel safety issues and shall not be under instructions from an employer in respect of those issues. A Safety Officer may perform his tasks and functions at several tunnels in a region.\n2.   The Safety Officer shall perform the following tasks/functions:\n(a)\nensure coordination with emergency services and take part in the preparation of operational schemes;\n(b)\ntake part in the planning, implementation and evaluation of emergency operations;\n(c)\ntake part in the definition of safety schemes and the specification of the structure, equipment and operation in respect of both new tunnels and modifications to existing tunnels;\n(d)\nverify that operational staff and emergency services are trained, and he shall take part in the organisation of exercises held at regular intervals;\n(e)\ngive advice on the commissioning of the structure, equipment and operation of tunnels;\n(f)\nverify that the tunnel structure and equipment are maintained and repaired;\n(g)\ntake part in the evaluation of any significant incident or accident as referred to in Article 5(3) and (4).\nArticle 7\nInspection Entity\nMember States shall ensure that inspections, evaluations and tests are carried out by Inspection Entities. The Administrative Authority may perform this function. Any entity performing the inspections, evaluations and tests must have a high level of competence and high quality procedures and must be functionally independent from the Tunnel Manager.\nArticle 8\nNotification of the Administrative Authority\nThe Member States shall notify the Commission of the name and address of the Administrative Authority by ... (6). In the event of a change in this information they shall notify the Commission thereof within three months.\nArticle 9\nTunnels whose design has not yet been approved\n1.   Any runnel whose design has not been approved by the responsible authority by [...] (7) shall be subject to the requirements of this Directive.\n2.   The tunnel shall be commissioned in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex II.\nArticle 10\nTunnels whose design has been approved but which are not yet open\n1.   In the case of tunnels whose design has been approved but which have not been opened to public traffic by [...] (7), the Administrative Authority shall assess their compliance with the requirements of this Directive, with specific reference to the safety documentation provided for in Annex II.\n2.   Where the Administrative Authority finds that a tunnel does not comply with the provisions of this Directive, it shall notify the Tunnel Manager that appropriate measures must be taken to increase safety and shall inform the Safety Officer.\n3.   The tunnel shall then be commissioned in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex II.\nArticle 11\nTunnels already in operation\n1.   In the case of tunnels which are already open to public traffic by [...] (8), the Administrative Authority shall have until [...] (9) to assess their compliance with the requirements of this Directive, with specific reference to the safety documentation provided for in Annex II and on the basis of an inspection.\n2.   The Tunnel Manager shall, if necessary, propose to the Administrative Authority a plan for adapting the tunnel to the provisions of this Directive and the remedial measures he intends to put in place.\n3.   The Administrative Authority shall give its approval to the remedial measures or ask for them to be modified.\n4.   Thereafter, if the remedial measures include any substantial modification in the construction or operation, then once these measures have been taken, the procedure laid down in Annex II shall be implemented.\n5.   Member States shall by (10) submit a report to the Commission on how they plan to meet the requirements of this Directive, on planned measures, and, where appropriate, on the consequences of opening or closing the main access roads to the tunnels. In order to minimise disturbances to traffic at European level, the Commission may comment on the timetable of the work intended to ensure that tunnels comply with the requirements of this Directive.\n6.   The refurbishment of tunnels shall be carried out according to a schedule and shall be finished by [...] (11).\n7.   Where the total tube length of existing tunnels divided by the total length of the part of the Trans-European Road Network located on their territory exceeds the European average, Members States may extend the period stipulated in paragraph 6 by five years.\nArticle 12\nPeriodic inspections\n1.   The Administrative Authority shall verify that regular inspections are carried out by the Inspection Entity to ensure that all tunnels falling within the scope of this Directive comply with its provisions.\n2.   The period between two consecutive inspections of any given tunnel shall not exceed six years.\n3.   Where, on the basis of the report of the Inspection Entity, the Administrative Authority finds that a tunnel does not comply with the provisions of this Directive, it shall notify the Tunnel Manager and the Safety Officer that measures to increase tunnel safety must be adopted. The Administrative Authority shall define the conditions for continuing to operate the tunnel or for re-opening the tunnel which will apply until the remedial measures and any further relevant restrictions or conditions are implemented.\n4.   If the remedial measures include any substantial modification in the tunnel's construction or operation, then once these measures have been taken, the tunnel shall be made the subject of a new authorisation to operate in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex II.\nArticle 13\nRisk analysis\n1.   Risk analyses, where necessary, shall be carried out by a body which is functionally independent from the Tunnel Manager. The content and the results of the risk analysis shall be included in the safety documentation submitted to the Administrative Authority. A risk analysis is an analysis of risks for a given tunnel, taking into account all design factors and traffic conditions that affect safety, notably traffic characteristics and type, tunnel length and tunnel geometry, as well as the forecast number of heavy goods vehicles per day.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that, at national level, a detailed and well-defined methodology, corresponding to the best available practices, is used and shall inform the Commission of the methodology applied; the Commission shall make this information available in electronic form to other Member States.\n3.   By [...] (12) the Commission shall publish a report on the practice followed in the Members States. Where necessary, it shall make proposals for the adoption of a common harmonised risk analysis methodology in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2).\nArticle 14\nDerogation for innovative techniques\n1.   In order to allow the installation and use of innovative safety equipment or the use of innovative safety procedures which provide an equivalent or higher level of protection than current technologies, as prescribed in this Directive, the Administrative Authority may grant a derogation from the requirements of the Directive on the basis of a duly documented request from the Tunnel Manager.\n2.   If the Administrative Authority intends to grant such a derogation, the Member State shall first submit a derogation application to the Commission containing the initial request and the opinion of the Inspection Entity.\n3.   The Commission shall notify the application to the Member States within one month of receipt.\n4.   If, within a period of three months, neither the Commission nor a Member State formulates objections, the derogation shall be treated as granted and the Commission shall inform all Member States accordingly.\n5.   If objections are expressed, the Commission shall make a proposal in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2). Where the decision is negative, the Administrative Authority shall not grant the derogation.\n6.   After an examination in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2), a decision to grant a derogation may allow this derogation to be applied to other tunnels.\n7.   Whenever justified by the derogation requests submitted to it, the Commission shall publish a report on the practice followed in the Member States and, if necessary, make proposals for amendment of this Directive.\nArticle 15\nReporting\n1.   Every two years, Member States shall compile reports on fires in tunnels and on accidents which clearly affect the safety of road users in tunnels, and on the frequency and causes of such incidents, and shall evaluate them and provide information on the actual role and effectiveness of safety facilities and measures. These reports shall be transmitted to the Commission by the Member States before the end of September of the year following the reporting period. The Commission shall make the reports available to all Member States.\n2.   Member States shall make a plan which includes a timetable for the gradual application of the provisions of this Directive to tunnels already in operation as described in Article 11 and notify it by [...] (13) to the Commission. Thereafter, Member States shall inform the Commission every two years of the state of implementation of the plan and of any changes made to it, until the end of the period referred to in Article 11(6) and (7).\nArticle 16\nAdaptation to technical progress\nThe Commission shall adapt the Annexes to this Directive to technical progress, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2).\nArticle 17\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3.   The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.\nArticle 18\nTransposition\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by [...] (14). They shall immediately forward to the Commission the text of those provisions, together with a table correlating those provisions with this Directive.\n2.   The provisions adopted by the Member States shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.\nArticle 19\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 20\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 29.4.2004.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nP.

Basis for deciding on safety measures\n1.1.   Safety parameters\n1.1.1.\nSafety measures to be implemented in a tunnel shall be based on a systematic consideration of all aspects of the system composed of the infrastructure, operation, users and vehicles.\n1.1.2.\nThe following parameters shall be taken into account:\n—\ntunnel length,\n—\nnumber of tubes,\n—\nnumber of lanes,\n—\ncross-sectional geometry,\n—\nvertical and horizontal alignment,\n—\ntype of construction,\n—\nuni-directional or bi-directional traffic,\n—\ntraffic volume per tube (including its time distribution),\n—\nrisk of congestion (daily or seasonal),\n—\naccess time for the emergency services,\n—\npresence and percentage of heavy goods vehicles,\n—\npresence, percentage and type of dangerous goods traffic,\n—\ncharacteristics of the access roads,\n—\nlane width,\n—\nspeed considerations,\n—\ngeographical and meteorological environment.\n1.1.3.\nWhere a tunnel has a special characteristic as regards the aforementioned parameters, a risk analysis shall be carried out in accordance with Article 13 to establish whether additional safety measures and/or supplementary equipment is necessary to ensure a high level of tunnel safety. This risk analysis shall take into consideration possible accidents, which clearly affect the safety of road users in tunnels and which might occur during the operating stage and the nature and magnitude of their possible consequences.\n1.2.   Minimum requirements\n1.2.1.\nThe safety measures required by the following paragraphs shall be implemented at a minimum in order to ensure a minimum level of safety in all the tunnels covered by the Directive. Limited derogations from these requirements may be allowed provided that the following procedure is completed successfully. Member States or the Administrative Authority shall send to the Commission information on the following:\nthe limited derogation(s) envisaged,\n—\nthe imperative reasons underlying the limited derogation envisaged,\n—\nthe alternative risk reduction measures which are to be used or reinforced in order to ensure at least an equivalent level of safety, including proof therefor in the form of an analysis of relevant risks.\nThe Commission shall transmit any request for a limited derogation to the Member States as soon as possible, and in any case within one month of receipt.\nIf, within a period of three months after receipt of the request by the Commission, neither the Commission nor a Member State formulates objections, the limited derogation shall be deemed granted and the Commission shall inform all Member States accordingly. If objections are expressed, the Commission shall make a proposal in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2). Where the decision is negative, the limited derogation shall not be allowed.\n1.2.2.\nIn order to provide a unified interface in all tunnels to which this Directive applies, no derogation from the requirements of the following paragraphs shall be allowed regarding the design of the safety facilities at the disposal of the tunnel users (emergency stations, signs, lay-bys, emergency exits, radio re-broadcasting when required).\n1.3.   Traffic volume\n1.3.1.\nWhere \"traffic volume\" is mentioned in this Annex, it refers to the annual average daily traffic through a tunnel per lane. For the purpose of determining the traffic volume, each motor vehicle shall be counted as one unit.\n1.3.2.\nWhere the number of heavy goods vehicles over 3,5 t exceeds 15% of the annual average daily traffic, or seasonal daily traffic significantly exceeds the annual average daily traffic, the additional risk will be assessed and taken into account by increasing the traffic volume of the tunnel for the application of the following paragraphs.\n2.   Infrastructure measures\n2.1.   Number of tubes and lanes\n2.1.1.\nThe main criteria for deciding whether to build a single or a twin-tube tunnel shall be projected traffic volume and safety, taking into account aspects such as the percentage of heavy goods vehicles, gradient and length.\n2.1.2.\nIn any case, where, for tunnels at the design stage, a 15-year forecast shows that the traffic volume will exceed 10 000 vehicles per day per lane, a twin-tube tunnel with unidirectional traffic shall be in place at the time when this value will be exceeded.\n2.1.3.\nWith the exception of the emergency lane, the same number of lanes shall be maintained inside and outside the tunnel. Any change in the number of lanes shall occur at a sufficient distance in front of the tunnel portal; this distance shall be at least the distance covered in 10 seconds by a vehicle travelling at the speed limit. When geographic circumstances prevent this, additional and/or reinforced measures shall be taken to enhance safety.\n2.2.   Tunnel geometry\n2.2.1.\nSpecial consideration shall be given to safety when designing the cross-sectional geometry and the horizontal and vertical alignment of a tunnel and its access roads, as these parameters have a significant influence on the probability and severity of accidents.\n2.2.2.\nLongitudinal gradients above 5% shall not be permitted in new tunnels, unless no other solution is geographically possible.\n2.2.3.\nIn tunnels with gradients higher than 3%, additional and/or reinforced measures shall be taken to enhance safety on the basis of a risk analysis.\n2.2.4.\nWhere the width of the slow lane is less than 3,5 m and heavy goods vehicles are allowed, additional and/or reinforced measures shall be taken to enhance safety, on the basis of a risk analysis.\n2.3.   Escape routes and emergency exits\n2.3.1.\nIn new tunnels without an emergency lane, emergency walkways, elevated or not, shall be provided for use by tunnel users in the event of a breakdown or an accident. This provision does not apply if the construction characteristics of the tunnel do not allow it or allow it only at disproportional cost and the tunnel is unidirectional and is equipped with a permanent surveillance and lane closure system.\n2.3.2.\nIn existing tunnels where there is neither an emergency lane nor an emergency walkway, additional and/or reinforced measures shall be taken to ensure safety.\n2.3.3.\nEmergency exits allow tunnel users to leave the tunnel without their vehicles and reach a safe place in the event of an accident or a fire and also provide access on foot to the tunnel for emergency services. Examples of such emergency exits are:\n—\ndirect exits from the tunnel to the outside,\n—\ncross-connections between tunnel tubes,\n—\nexits to an emergency gallery,\n—\nshelters with an escape route separate from the tunnel tube.\n2.3.4.\nShelters without an exit leading to escape routes to the open shall not be built.\n2.3.5.\nEmergency exits shall be provided if an analysis of relevant risks, including how far and how quickly smoke travels under local conditions, shows that the ventilation and other safety provisions are insufficient to ensure the safety of road users.\n2.3.6.\nIn any event, in new tunnels, emergency exits shall be provided where the traffic volume is higher than 2 000 vehicles per lane.\n2.3.7.\nIn existing tunnels longer than 1 000 m, with a traffic volume higher than 2 000 vehicles per lane, the feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation of new emergency exits shall be evaluated.\n2.3.8.\nWhere emergency exits are provided, the distance between two emergency exits shall not exceed 500 m.\n2.3.9.\nAppropriate means, such as doors, shall be used to prevent smoke and heat from reaching the escape routes behind the emergency exit, so that the runnel users can safely reach the outside and the emergency services can have access to the tunnel.\n2.4.   Access for emergency services\n2.4.1.\nIn twin-tube tunnels where the tubes are at the same level or nearly, cross-connections suitable for the use of emergency services shall be provided at least every 1 500 m.\n2.4.2.\nWherever geographically possible, crossing of the central reserve (median strip) shall be made possible outside each portal of a twin- or multi-tube tunnel. This measure will allow emergency services to gain immediate access to either tube.\n2.5.   Lay-bys\n2.5.1.\nFor new bi-directional tunnels longer than 1 500 m where traffic volume is higher than 2 000 vehicles per lane, lay-bys shall be provided at distances which do not exceed 1 000 m, if emergency lanes are not provided.\n2.5.2.\nIn existing bi-directional tunnels longer than 1 500 m with a traffic volume higher than 2 000 vehicles per lane but no emergency lane, the feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation of lay-bys shall be evaluated.\n2.5.3.\nIf the construction characteristics of the tunnel do not allow it or allow it only at disproportionate cost, lay-bys do not have to be provided if the total tunnel width which is accessible to vehicles, excluding elevated parts and normal traffic lanes, is at least equal to the width of one normal traffic lane.\n2.5.4.\nLay-bys shall include an emergency station.\n2.6.   Drainage\n2.6.1.\nWhere the transport of dangerous goods is permitted, the drainage of flammable and toxic liquids shall be provided for through well-designed slot gutters or other measures within the tunnel cross sections. Additionally, the drainage system shall be designed and maintained to prevent fire and flammable and toxic liquids from spreading inside tubes and between tubes.\n2.6.2.\nIf in existing tunnels that requirement cannot be met or can be met only at disproportionate cost, this shall be taken into consideration when deciding whether to allow the transport of dangerous goods on the basis of an analysis of relevant risks.\n2.7.

Table displaying informative summary of minimum requirements\nThe table set out hereafter gives a summary of the minimum requirements laid down in the previous paragraphs. The minimum requirements are those set out in the operative text of this Annex.\n3.   Measures concerning operations\n3.1.   Operating means\nTunnel operation shall be organised and dispose of such means as will ensure the continuity and safety of the traffic through the tunnel. The personnel involved in the operation as well as the emergency services shall receive appropriate initial and continuing training.\n3.2.   Emergency planning\nEmergency response plans shall be available for all tunnels. In tunnels starting and finishing in different Member States, a single bi-national emergency response plan shall involve the two countries.\n3.3.   Works in tunnels\nComplete or partial closure of lanes due to construction or maintenance works planned in advance shall always begin outside the tunnel. Variable message signs, traffic signals and mechanical barriers may be used for this purpose.\n3.4.   Management of accidents and incidents\nIn the event of a serious accident or incident, all appropriate tunnel tubes shall be closed immediately to traffic.\nThis shall be done by simultaneous activation not only of the abovementioned equipment before the portals, but also of variable message signs, traffic signals and mechanical barriers inside the tunnel, if available, so that all the traffic can be stopped as soon as possible outside and inside the tunnel. Tunnels of less than 1 000 m may be closed by other means. Traffic shall be managed in such a way that unaffected vehicles can quickly leave the tunnel.\nThe access time for emergency services in the event of an incident in a tunnel shall be as short as possible and shall be measured during periodic exercises. In addition, it may be measured during incidents. In major bi-directional tunnels with high traffic volumes, a risk analysis in accordance with Article 13 shall establish whether emergency services shall be stationed at the two extremities of the tunnel.\n3.5.   Activity of the control centre\nFor all tunnels requiring a control centre, including those starting and finishing in different Member States, a single control centre shall have full control at any given time.\n3.6.   Tunnel closure\nIn the event of tunnel closure (long or short-term), users shall be informed of the best alternative itineraries, by means of easily accessible information systems.\nSuch alternative itineraries shall form part of systematic contingency plans. They should aim to maintain traffic flow as much as possible and minimise secondary safety effects on the surrounding areas.\nMember States should make all reasonable efforts to avoid a situation in which a tunnel located on the territory of two Member States can not be used due to the consequences of bad weather conditions.\n3.7.   Transport of dangerous goods\nThe following measures shall be applied concerning access to tunnels for vehicles transporting dangerous goods, as defined in the relevant European legislation regarding the transport of dangerous goods by road:\n—\nperform a risk analysis in accordance with Article 13 before the regulations and requirements regarding the transportation of dangerous goods through a tunnel are defined or modified,\n—\nplace appropriate signs to enforce the regulation before the last possible exit before the tunnel and at tunnel entrances, as well as in advance so as to allow drivers to choose alternative routes,\n—\nconsider specific operating measures designed to reduce the risks related to some or all of the vehicles transporting dangerous goods in tunnels, such as declaration before entering or passage in convoys escorted by accompanying vehicles, on a case by case basis further to the aforementioned risk analysis.\n3.8.   Overtaking in tunnels\nA risk analysis shall be carried out in order to decide whether heavy goods vehicles should be allowed to overtake in tunnels with more than one lane in each direction.\n3.9.   Distances between vehicles and speed\nThe appropriate speed of vehicles and the safe distance between them are especially important in tunnels and shall be given close attention. This shall include advising tunnel users of appropriate speeds and distances. Enforcement measures shall be initiated as appropriate.\nRoad users driving passenger cars should under normal conditions maintain a minimum distance from the vehicle in front of them equivalent to the distance travelled by a vehicle in 2 seconds. For heavy goods vehicles this distance should be doubled.\nWhen traffic stops in a tunnel, road users should maintain a minimum distance of 5 metres from the vehicle in front, except if this is not possible due to an emergency stop.\n4.   Information campaigns\nInformation campaigns regarding safety in tunnels shall be regularly organised and implemented in conjunction with interested parties on the basis of the harmonised work of international organisations. These information campaigns shall cover the correct behaviour of road users when approaching and driving through tunnels, especially in connection with vehicle breakdown, congestion, accidents and fires.\nInformation on the safety equipment available and proper road user behaviour in tunnels shall be provided in convenient places for tunnel users (for example at rest areas before tunnels, at tunnel entrances when the traffic is stopped or on the internet).\nANNEX II\nApproval of the design, safety documentation, commissioning of a tunnel, modifications and periodic exercises\n1.

Tunnel closure will only be required if acceptable arrangements can be made for diverting traffic. Partial and/or simulation exercises shall be conducted every year in between. In areas where several tunnels are located in close proximity to each other, a full scale exercise must be conducted in at least one of those tunnels.\n(b)\nThe Safety Officer and the emergency services shall evaluate jointly these exercises draw up a report and make appropriate proposals.\nANNEX III\nSigning for tunnels\n1.   General requirements\nThe following are road signs and symbols to be used for tunnels. Road signs mentioned in this section are described in the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968, unless otherwise specified.\nIn order to facilitate international understanding of signs, the system of signs and signals prescribed in this Annex is based on the use of shapes and colours characteristic of each class of sign and, wherever possible, on the use of graphic symbols rather than words. Where Member States consider it necessary to modify the signs and symbols prescribed, the modifications made shall not alter their essential characteristics. Where Member States do not apply the Vienna Convention, the prescribed signs and symbols may be modified, provided that the modifications made shall not alter their essential intent.\n1.1.\nRoad signs shall be used to designate the following safety facilities in tunnels:\nLay-bys;\nEmergency exits: the same sign shall be used for all kinds of emergency exits;\nEscape routes: the two nearest emergency exits shall be signed on the sidewalls at distances of no more than 25 m, at a height of 1,0 to 1,5 m above escape route level, with an indication of the distances to the exits;\nEmergency stations: signs to indicate the presence of emergency phones and fire extinguishers.\n1.2.\nRadio:\nIn tunnels where users can receive information via their radio, appropriate signs placed before the entrance shall inform users on how to receive this information.\n1.3.\nSigns and markings shall be designed and positioned so that they are clearly visible.\n2.   Description of signs and panels\nMember States shall use appropriate signs, if necessary, in the advance warning area of the tunnel, inside the runnel and after the end of the tunnel. When designing the signs for a tunnel, local traffic and construction conditions as well as other local conditions shall be considered. Signs according to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals shall be used, except in Member States which do not apply the Vienna Convention.\n2.1.\nTunnel sign\nThe following sign shall be put at each entrance of the tunnel:\nSign El 1A for Road Tunnels of the Vienna Convention;\nThe length shall be included either in the lower part of the panel or on a additional panel H2.\nFor tunnels over 3 000 m, the remaining length of the tunnel shall be indicated every 1 000 m.\nThe name of the tunnel may also be indicated.\n2.2.\nHorizontal signing\nHorizontal delineation should be used at the roadside edge.\nIn the case of bi-directional runnels, clearly visible means should be used along the median line (single or twin) separating the two directions.\n2.3.\nSigns and panels for signing of facilities\nEmergency stations\nEmergency stations shall bear informative signs, which shall be F signs according to the Vienna Convention and indicate the equipment available to road users, such as:\nIn emergency stations which are separated from the tunnel by a door, a clearly legible text, written in appropriate languages, shall indicate that the emergency station does not ensure protection in case of fire. An example is given below:\n\"THIS AREA DOES NOT PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM FIRE\nFollow signs to emergency exits\"\nLay-bys\nThe signs to indicate lay-bys should be E signs according to the Vienna Convention. Telephones and fire extinguishers shall be indicated by an additional panel or incorporated in the sign itself.\nEmergency exits\nThe signs to indicate \"Emergency exits\" should be G signs according to the Vienna Convention. Examples are shown below:\nIt is also necessary to sign the two nearest exits on the sidewalls. Examples are shown below.\nLane signals\nThese signs can be circular or rectangular\nVariable message signing\nAny variable message signs shall have clear indications to inform tunnel users of congestion, breakdown, accident, fire or any other hazards.", "summary": "Road tunnels: EU safety rules\nRoad tunnels: EU safety rules\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2004/54/EC on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt lays down minimum safety standards regarding the various organisational, structural, technical and operational aspects of road tunnels that form part of designated trans-European transport infrastructure.\nKEY POINTS\nSafety requirements\nThe directive seeks to ensure that all tunnels longer than 500 metres, whether in operation, under construction or at the design stage, and forming part of the trans-European road network, comply with the new harmonised safety requirements.\nAdministrative authority\nEach EU country must designate one or more administrative authority, responsible for all aspects of tunnel safety. Authorities take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the directive.\nThis authority may be set up at national, regional or local level. In the case of tunnels running between countries, each of the countries can appoint an authority or the two countries appoint a joint authority.\nThe authority’s prior authorisation is required when a new tunnel is commissioned or an existing one is to be rebuilt. The authority has the power to suspend or restrict the operation of a tunnel if the safety conditions are not met.\nThe authority ensures that the following tasks are performed:\ntesting and inspecting tunnels on a regular basis and drawing up the related safety requirements;\nputting in place organisational and operational schemes (including emergency response plans) for the training and equipping of emergency services;\nestablishing the procedure for immediate closure of a tunnel in case of an emergency;\nimplementing the necessary risk reduction measures.\nTunnel manager\nFor each tunnel located on the territory of an EU country, whether it is in the design, construction or operating stage, the authority identifies as Tunnel Manager, the public or private body responsible for the management of the tunnel at the stage in question. The Tunnel Manager must prepare a report in the event of any significant incident or accident occurring in a tunnel.\nSafety officer\nFor each tunnel, the Tunnel Manager, with the prior approval of the administrative authority, nominates a Safety Officer who coordinates all preventive and safeguarding measures to ensure the safety of users and operations staff. The Safety Officer’s tasks include:\ncoordinating with the emergency services and taking part in the preparation of operational schemes;\ntaking part in the planning, implementation and evaluation of emergency operations;\ntaking part in drawing up safety plans and specifications of infrastructure installations;\nchecking that operational staff and emergency services are trained, and taking part in the organisation of exercises held at regular intervals;\nadvising on the commissioning of the structure, equipment and operation of tunnels;\nchecking that the tunnel structure and equipment are maintained and repaired;\ntaking part in the evaluation of any significant incident or accident.\nPeriodic inspections\nEU countries ensure that inspections, evaluations and tests are carried out by inspection bodies.\nThe administrative authority verifies that regular inspections are carried out by the inspection body to ensure that all tunnels that fall within this directive's scope comply with its rules.\nThe period between two consecutive inspections of any given tunnel should not exceed 6 years.\nRisk analysis\nA risk analysis, based on a single methodology defined at national level, at the request of the administrative authority, is carried out by an independent body for a given tunnel. It takes into account all design factors and traffic conditions that affect safety, notably traffic characteristics and type, length and geometry of the tunnel, as well as the projected number of heavy goods vehicles per day.\nReports\nEvery 2 years, EU countries compile reports on fires in tunnels and on accidents which clearly affect the safety of road users in tunnels, and on the frequency and causes of such incidents, and evaluate them and provide information on the actual role and effectiveness of safety facilities and measures.\nAdaptation to technical progress\nThe Commission has powers to adapt the annexes to this directive in line with technical progress.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 30 April 2004. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 30 April 2006.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nTunnels are important infrastructures essential for long-distance transport and the development of the EU’s regional economies. However, accidents in tunnels, particularly fires, can have dramatic consequences and be extremely costly in terms of human life, increased congestion, pollution and repair costs.\nFor more information, see ‘Tunnels’ on the European Commission's website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2004/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network (OJ L 167, 30.4.2004, pp. 39-91)\nCorrigendum\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2004/54/EC have been incorporated in the basic text.
