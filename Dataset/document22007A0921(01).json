The agreement, initially for 10 years, is open to other ITER parties. It will continue after 10 years if none of the parties terminates it.\nThe decision concludes the agreement on behalf of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom).\nKEY POINTS\nActivities\nThe broader approach activities refer to 3 research projects developed in Japan:\nthe project completing the design of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF/EVEDA), for the testing and qualification of advanced materials in environment conditions comparable to those of a fusion power reactor;\nthe Satellite Tokamak programme, to develop operating scenarios for the ITER and DEMO projects;\nthe project relating to the International Fusion Energy Research Centre, a body responsible for coordinating the DEMO design R & D, large-scale simulation of plasmas to produce fusion power by supercomputers and remote experimentation to facilitate broad participation by scientists in the experiments conducted under ITER.\nStructure\nThe management structure for these broader approach activities comprises:\nthe steering committee;\nthe secretariat;\nthe project committee(s);\nthe project leader(s) and project team(s);\nthe implementing agencies.\nImplementing instruments\nThe project plan (covering the duration of the project), which is submitted to the steering committee for approval no later than 31 March each year by each project leader after consulting the project committee, comprises: a description of all the planned activities;a detailed schedule of the main stages of implementation;an overview of the contributions made and to be made.\nAfter consulting the project committee, each project leader, no later than 31 October each year, submits a work programme for the following year to the steering committee for approval, containing: the points of the corresponding project plan;programming specifications for the activities to be carried out (objectives, planning, current expenditure, contributions expected from each party, etc.).\nEach project leader submits an annual report to the steering committee for approval (no later than 31 March of each year). This document is then forwarded to the parties and the implementing agencies.\nEach party is entitled to carry out a financial audit at any time during this agreement and for up to 5 years following its termination.\nResources\nThe resources for the implementation of the broader approach activities may be: contributions in kind;specific components, equipment and materials, as well as goods and services;the experts made available to the project teams;the personnel made available to the various management bodies;financial contributions.\nThe EU contribution, which mainly takes the form of contributions in kind, amounts to approximately €340 million.\nIn March 2020, Euratom and Japan signed a joint declaration reaffirming that, as of 2020, the broader approach is to focus on operating and exploiting the facilities that have already been set up, for the benefit of both parties. As ITER is approaching its own First Plasma and the beginning of its operation, teams working on the broader approach will work more closely with ITER to ensure that it moves forward as smoothly as possible.\nIntellectual property (IP)\nThe agreement defines IP as provided in Article 2 of the UN World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Convention of 14 July 1967.\nProject leaders have a duty to inform the steering committee of any potential protectable IP that is created and recommend the jurisdiction where such protection should be obtained.\nThe parties should: support the widest possible dissemination of information resulting from the implementation of the agreement;ensure that information created by project teams and implementing agencies is made freely available to each of the parties for use in the research and development of fusion energy;have a non-exclusive, irrevocable and royalty-free licence in all countries to translate, reproduce and publicly distribute scientific and technical publications directly arising from the implementation;ensure proper and free exchange of information needed to accomplish the tasks of the project teams and that information marked as confidential is disseminated according to the confidentiality rules. The rights and titles to IP created by implementing agency staff would belong to the agency concerned.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nIt entered into force on 1 June 2007.\nBACKGROUND\nBroader approach — Cutting-edge fusion energy research activities — booklet (European Commission)\nFusion energy collaboration between the EU and Japan: mastering the power of the sun — press release (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement between the European Atomic Energy Community and the Government of Japan for the Joint Implementation of the Broader Approach Activities in the Field of Fusion Energy Research (OJ L 246, 21.9.2007, pp. 34-46)\nCouncil Decision 2007/614/Euratom of 30 January 2007 concerning the conclusion, by the Commission, of the Agreement between the European Atomic Energy Community and the Government of Japan for the Joint Implementation of the Broader Approach Activities in the Field of Fusion Energy Research (OJ L 246, 21.9.2007, pp. 32-33)\nlast update 12.05.2020", "tags": ["nuclear fusion", "Japan", "peaceful use of energy", "EAEC", "cooperation agreement (EU)", "nuclear research"], "subjects": ["Nuclear common market", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
