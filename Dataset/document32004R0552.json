as a result, industry is particularly affected since it needs to considerably adapt its products for each national market; these practices render development and implementation of new technology unnecessarily difficult and slow down the introduction of new operational concepts that are required to increase capacity.(7) It is therefore in the interest of all those involved in air traffic management to develop a new partnership approach allowing the balanced involvement of all parties and stimulating creativity and the sharing of knowledge, experience and risks; such partnership should aim at defining, in cooperation with industry, a coherent set of Community specifications that can fulfil the widest possible range of needs.(8) The internal market is a Community objective and therefore measures taken under this Regulation should contribute to its progressive development in this sector.(9) It is therefore appropriate to define essential requirements which should apply to the European air traffic management network, its systems, constituents and associated procedures.(10) Implementing rules for interoperability should be drawn up for systems whenever necessary to complement or further refine the essential requirements; those rules should also be drawn up where necessary to facilitate the coordinated introduction of new, agreed and validated concepts of operation or technologies; compliance with those rules should be permanently maintained; those rules should rely on rules and standards developed by international organisations such as Eurocontrol or ICAO.(11) The development and adoption of Community specifications concerning EATMN, its systems and constituents and associated procedures is an appropriate means of defining the technical and operational conditions necessary to meet the essential requirements and relevant implementing rules for interoperability; compliance with published Community specifications, which remains voluntary, creates a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements and the relevant implementing rules for interoperability.(12) Community specifications should be established by the European standardisation bodies in conjunction with the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (Eurocae) and by Eurocontrol, in accordance with general Community standardisation procedures.(13) The procedures governing the assessment of conformity or suitability for use of constituents should be based on the use of the modules covered by Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives(9); as far as necessary, these modules should be expanded to cover specific requirements of the industries concerned.(14) The market concerned is of small size and consists of systems and constituents used almost exclusively for air traffic management purposes and not intended for the general public; it would be therefore excessive to affix the CE mark to constituents as, on the basis of the assessment of conformity and/or suitability for use, the manufacturer's declaration of conformity is sufficient; that should not affect the obligation on manufacturers to affix the CE mark to certain constituents in order to certify their compliance with other Community legislation relating to them.(15) The putting into service of air traffic management systems should be subject to verification of compliance with the essential requirements and relevant implementing rules for interoperability; use of Community specifications creates a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements and relevant implementing rules for interoperability.(16) The full application of this Regulation should be accomplished by means of a transitional strategy designed to attain the objectives of this Regulation while not creating unjustified cost-benefit barriers to preservation of the existing infrastructure.(17) Within the framework of the relevant Community legislation, due account should be taken of the need to ensure:- harmonised conditions with regard to the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum necessary for the implementation of the Single European Sky, including electromagnetic compatibility aspects,- protection of the safety-of-life services from harmful interference,- efficient andappropriate use of frequencies allocated to and managed exclusively by the aviation sector.(18) Council Directive 93/65/EEC of 19 July 1993 on the definition and use of compatible technical specifications for the procurement of air traffic management equipment and systems(10) is limited to obligations of awarding entities; this Regulation is more comprehensive in that it addresses obligations of all actors, including air navigation service providers, airspace users, industry and airports, and provides both for rules applicable to all and for the adoption of Community specifications which, while being voluntary, creates a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. Therefore, Directive 93/65/EEC, Commission Directive 97/15/EC of 25 March 1997 adopting Eurocontrol standards and amending Council Directive 93/65/EEC on the definition and use of compatible technical specifications for the procurement of air-traffic-management equipment and systems(11) and Commission Regulations (EC) No 2082/2000 of 6 September 2000 adopting Eurocontrol standards and amending Directive 97/15/EC(12) and (EC) No 980/2002 of 4 June 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 2082/2000 should be repealed after a transitional period.(19) For reasons of legal certainty it is important to ensure that the substance of certain provisions of Community legislation adopted on the basis of Directive 93/65/EEC remains in force unchanged. The adoption under this Regulation of the implementing rules corresponding to such provisions will necessitate a certain amount of time,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:CHAPTER IGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1Objective and scope1.

Verification procedure for systemsVerification of systems is the procedure whereby an air navigation service provider checks and certifies that a system complies with this Regulation and may be put into operation on the basis of this Regulation.The system is checked for each of the following aspects:- overall design,- development and integration of the system, including in particular constituent assembly and overall adjustments,- operational system integration,- specific system maintenance provisions if applicable.Where involvement of a notified body is required by the relevant implementing rule for interoperability, the notified body, after having carried out the tasks incumbent upon it in accordance with the rule, draws up a certificate of conformity in relation to the tasks it carried out. This certificate is intended for the air navigation service provider. This provider then draws up the EC declaration of verification intended for the national supervisory authority.3. Technical fileThe technical file accompanying the EC declaration of verification must contain all the necessary documents relating to the characteristics of the system, including conditions and limits of use, as well as the documents certifying conformity of constituents where appropriate.The following documents shall be included as a minimum:- indication of the relevant parts of the technical specifications used for procurement that ensure compliance with the applicable implementing rules for interoperability and, where appropriate, the Community specifications,- list of constituents as referred to in Article 3 of this Regulation,- copies of the EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use with which the above mentioned constituents must be provided in accordance with Article 5 of this Regulation accompanied, where appropriate, by a copy of the records of the tests and examinations carried out by the notified bodies,- where a notified body has been involved in the verification of the system(s), a certificate countersigned by itself, stating that the system complies with this Regulation and mentioning any reservations recorded during performance of activities and not withdrawn,- where there has not been involvement of a notified body, a record of the tests and installation configurations made with a view to ensuring compliance with essential requirements and any particular requirements contained in the relevant implementing rules for interoperability.4. SubmissionThe technical file must be attached to the EC declaration of verification which the air navigation service provider submits to the national supervisory authority.A copy of the technical file must be kept by the provider throughout the service life of the system. It must be sent to any other Member States which so request.ANNEX VNOTIFIED BODIES1. The body, its Director and the staff responsible for carrying out the checks may not become involved, either directly or as authorised representatives, in the design, manufacture, marketing or maintenance of the constituents or systems or in their use. This does not exclude the possibility of an exchange of technical information between the manufacturer or constructor and that body.2. The body and the staff responsible for the checks must carry out the checks with the greatest possible professional integrity and the greatest possible technical competence and must be free of any pressure and incentive, in particular of a financial type, which could affect their judgment or the results of their inspection, in particular from persons or groups of persons affected by the results of the checks.3. The body must employ staff and possess the means required to perform adequately the technical and administrative tasks linked with the checks; it should also have access to the equipment needed for exceptional checks.4. The staff responsible for inspection must have:- sound technical and vocational training,- satisfactory knowledge of the requirements of the inspections they carry out and adequate experience of such operations,- the ability required to draw up the declarations, records and reports to demonstrate that the inspections have been carried out.5. The impartiality of the inspection staff must be guaranteed. Their remuneration must not depend on the number of inspections carried out or on the results of such inspections.6. The body must take out liability insurance unless its liability is assumed by the Member State in accordance with national law, or the Member State itself is directly responsible for the inspections.7. The staff of the body must observe professional secrecy with regard to all information acquired in carrying out their tasks under this Regulation.", "summary": "Interoperability of the European air traffic management network\nInteroperability of the European air traffic management network\nDifferences between national technical specifications used for tenders have led to fragmentation of the market and systems and make industrial cooperation at Community level more difficult. European industry is particularly affected, as considerable efforts have to be made to adapt products to national markets.\nACT\n                  \nRegulation (EC) No 552/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management network (the interoperability Regulation) [See amending act(s)].\nSUMMARY\n                  \nThe regulation forms part of a package of legislation on air traffic management aimed at the creation of a single European sky as from 31 December 2004. This objective will enable optimum use to be made of European airspace, which will help to reduce delays and boost growth in air transport.\nThe aim of this regulation is to define common requirements to guarantee interoperability between the various air traffic management systems used. It establishes a harmonised system of certification for components and systems.\nThe aim of the regulation is two-fold:\nto achieve interoperability between the different systems, constituents and associated procedures in the European air traffic management network;\nto ensure the introduction of new agreed and validated concepts of operations and technology in air traffic management.\nEssential requirements\nThe European air traffic management network, its systems and their constituents must meet essential requirements. These are of two kinds:\ngeneral requirements: seamless operation , support for new concepts of operation, safety, civil/military coordination, environmental constraints, principles governing the logical architecture of systems and principles governing the construction of systems;\nspecific requirements: systems and procedures for airspace management, systems and procedures for air traffic flow management, systems and procedures for air traffic services, communications systems and procedures for ground-to-ground, air-to-ground and air-to-air communications, navigation procedures, surveillance systems and procedures, systems and procedures for aeronautical information services and for the use of meteorological information.\nImplementing rules for interoperability\nThe implementing rules for interoperability must in particular:\ndetermine any specific requirements, in particular in terms of safety;\ndescribe, where appropriate, any specific requirements, in particular regarding the coordinated introduction of new concepts of operation;\ndescribe the specific conformity assessment procedures involving notified bodies to be used to assess the conformity or suitability for use of constituents, as well as for the verification of systems;\nspecify the conditions of implementation including, where appropriate, the date by which all relevant stakeholders are required to comply with them.\nCommunity specifications\nThese specification may be:\nEuropean standards for systems or constituents, together with the relevant procedures, drawn up by the European standardisation bodies; or\nspecifications drawn up by Eurocontrol on matters of operational coordination between air navigation service providers.\nEC declaration of conformity or suitability for use of components\nConstituents must be accompanied by a European Community (EC) declaration of conformity or suitability for use. Before a system is put into service, the relevant air navigation service provider must establish an EC declaration of verification, confirming compliance, and must submit it to the national supervisory authority together with a technical file.\nSafeguards\nWhere the national supervisory authority ascertains that a constituent or a system accompanied by an EC declaration of conformity/verification does not comply with the essential requirements for interoperability, it must restrict the application of the constituent or prohibit its use. The EU country concerned must immediately inform the Commission of any such measures, indicating the reasons for it.\nWhere the Commission establishes that the measures taken by the supervisory authority are not justified, it will request the EU country concerned to ensure that they are withdrawn without delay.\nTransitional arrangements\nStarting from 20 October 2005, the essential requirements will apply to the putting into service of systems and constituents of the European air traffic management network.\nCompliance with the essential requirements will be required for all systems and constituents of the European air traffic management network currently in operation by 20 April 2011.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 552/2004\n20.4.2004\n-\nOJ L 96 of 31.3.2004\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 1070/2009\n4.12.2009\n-\nOJ L 300 of 14.11.2009\nSuccessive amendments and corrections to Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 have been incorporated in the basic text.
