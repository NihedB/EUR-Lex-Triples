therefore, the provisions of the said Directive, in particular those relating to worker information, to the consultation and participation of workers and to the training of workers, are also fully applicable to cases in which workers are potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres, without prejudice to more restrictive or specific provisions contained in this Directive;(6) This Directive constitutes a practical step towards the achievement of the social dimension of the internal market;(7) Directive 94/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 March 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres(5) states that it is intended to prepare an additional Directive based on Article 137 of the Treaty covering, in particular, explosion hazards which derive from a given use and/or types and methods of installation of equipment;(8) Explosion protection is of particular importance to safety; whereas explosions endanger the lives and health of workers as a result of the uncontrolled effects of flame and pressure, the presence of noxious reaction products and consumption of the oxygen in the ambient air which workers need to breathe;(9) The establishment of a coherent strategy for the prevention of explosions requires that organisational measures complement the technical measures taken at the workplace; Directive 89/391/EEC requires the employer to be in possession of an assessment of the risks to workers' health and safety at work; this requirement is to be regarded as being specified by this Directive in that it provides that the employer is to draw up an explosion protection document, or set of documents, which satisfies the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive and is to keep it up to date; the explosion protection document includes the identification of the hazards, the evaluation of risks and the definition of the specific measures to be taken to safeguard the health and safety of workers at risk from explosive atmospheres, in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 89/391/EEC; the explosion protection document may be part of the assessment of the risks to health and safety at work required by Article 9 of Directive 89/391/EEC;(10) An assessment of explosion risks may be required under other Community acts; whereas, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of work, the employer should be allowed, in accordance with national practice, to combine documents, parts of documents or other equivalent reports produced under other Community acts to form a single \"safety report\";(11) The prevention of the formation of explosive atmospheres also includes the application of the substitution principle;(12) Coordination should take place when workers from several undertakings are present at the same workplace;(13) Preventive measures must be supplemented if necessary by additional measures which become effective when ignition has taken place; maximum safety can be achieved by combining preventive measures with other additional measures limiting the detrimental effects of explosions on workers;(14) Council Directive 92/58/EEC of 24 June 1992 on the minimum requirements for the provision of safety and/or health signs at work (ninth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)(6) is fully applicable, in particular to places immediately contiguous to hazardous areas, where smoking, crosscutting, welding and other activities introducing flames or sparks may interact with the hazardous area;(15) Directive 94/9/EC divides the equipment and protective systems which it covers into equipment groups and categories; this Directive provides for a classification by the employer of the places where explosive atmospheres may occur in terms of zones and determines which equipment and protective systems groups and categories should be used in each zone,HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:SECTION IGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1Object and scope1.

Decision as last amended by the 1994 Act of Accession.ANNEX ICLASSIFICATION OF PLACES WHERE EXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERES MAY OCCURPreliminary noteThe following system of classification must be applied to places where precautions in accordance with Articles 3, 4, 7 and 8 are taken.1. Places where explosive atmospheres may occurA place in which an explosive atmosphere may occur in such quantities as to require special precautions to protect the health and safey of the workers concerned is deemed to be hazardous within the meaning of this Directive.A place in which an explosive atmosphere is not expected to occur in such quantities as to require special precautions is deemed to be non-hazardous within the meaning of this Directive.Flammable and/or combustible substances are considered as materials which may form an explosive atmosphere unless an investigation of their properties has shown that in mixtures with air they are incapable of independently propagating an explosion.2. Classification of hazardous placesHazardous places are classified in terms of zones on the basis of the frequency and duration of the occurrence of an explosive atmosphere.The extent of the measures to be taken in accordance with Annex II, Part A, is determined by this classification.Zone 0A place in which an explosive atmosphere consisting of a mixture with air of flammable substances in the form of gas, vapour or mist is present continuously or for long periods or frequently.Zone 1A place in which an explosive atmosphere consisting of a mixture with air or flammable substances in the form of gas, vapour or mist is likely to occur in normal operation occasionally.Zone 2A place in which an explosive atmosphere consisting of a mixture with air of flammable substances in the form of gas, vapour or mist is not likely to occur in normal operation but, if it does occur, will persist for a short period only.Zone 20A place in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustable dust in air is present continously, or for long periods or frequently.Zone 21A place in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is likely to occur in normal operation occasionally.Zone 22A place in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is not likely to occur in normal operation but, if it does occur, will persist for a short period only.Notes:1. Layers, deposits and heaps of combustible dust must be considered as any other source which can form an explosive atmosphere.2. \"Normal operation\" means the situation when installations are used within their design parameters.ANNEX IIA. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVING THE SAFETY AND HEALTH PROTECTION OF WORKERS POTENTIALLY AT RISK FROM EXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERESPreliminary noteThe obligations laid down in this Annex apply to:- places classified as hazardous in accordance with Annex I whenever required by the features of workplaces, workstations, the equipment or substances used or the danger caused by the activity related to the risks from explosive atmospheres,- equipment in non-hazardous places which is required for, or helps to ensure, the safe operation of equipment located in hazardous places.1. Organisational measures1.1. Training of workersThe employer must provide those working in places where explosive atmospheres may occur with sufficient and appropriate training with regard to explosion protection.1.2. Written instructions and permits to workWhere required by the explosion protection document:- work in hazardous places must be carried out in accordance with written instructions issued by the employer,- a system of permits to work must be applied for carrying out both hazardous activities and activities which may interact with other work to cause hazards.Permits to work must be issued by a person with responsibility for this function prior to the commencement of work.2. Explosion protection measures2.1. Any escape and/or release, whether or not intentional, of flammable gases, vapours, mists or combustible dusts which may give rise to explosion hazards must be suitably diverted or removed to a safe place or, if that is not practicable, safely contained or rendered safe by some other suitable method.2.2. If an explosive atmosphere contains several types of flammable and/or combustible gases, vapours, mists or dusts, protective measures shall be appropriate to the greatest potential risk.2.3. Prevention of ignition hazards in accordance with Article 3 must also take account of electrostatic discharges, where workers or the working environment act as charge carrier or charge producer. Workers must be provided with appropriate working clothes consisting of materials which do not give rise to electrostatic discharges that can ignite explosive atmospheres.2.4. Plant, equipment, protective systems and any associated connecting devices must only be brought into service if the explosion protection document indicates that they can be safely used in an explosive atmosphere. This applies also to work equipment and associated connecting devices which are not regarded as equipment or protective systems within the meaning of Directive 94/9/EC if their incorporation into an installation can in itself give rise to an ignition hazard. Necessary measures must be taken to prevent confusion between connecting devices.2.5. All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that the workplace, work equipment and any associated connecting device made available to workers have been designed, constructed, assembled and installed, and are maintained and operated, in such a way as to minimise the risks of an explosion and, if an explosion does occur, to control or minimise its propagation within that workplace and/or work equipment. For such workplaces appropriate measures must be taken to minimise the risks to workers from the physical effects of an explosion.2.6. Where necessary, workers must be given optical and/or acoustic warnings and withdrawn before the explosion conditions are reached.2.7. Where required by the explosion protection document, escape facilities must be provided and maintained to ensure that, in the event of danger, workers can leave endangered places promptly and safely.2.8. Before a workplace containing places where explosive atmospheres may occur is used for the first time, its overall explosion safety must be verified. Any conditions necessary for ensuring explosion protection must be maintained.Such verification must be carried out by persons competent in the field of explosion protection as a result of their experience and/or professional training.2.9. Where the risk assessment shows it is necessary:- it must be possible, where power failure can give rise to the spread of additional risks, to maintain equipment and protective systems in a safe state of operation independently of the rest of the installation in the event of power failure,- manual override must be possible in order to shut down the equipment and protective systems incorporated within automatic processes which deviate from the intended operating conditions, provided that this does not compromise safety. Only workers competent to do so may take such action,- on operation of the emergency shutdown, accumulated energy must be dissipated as quickly and as safely as possible or isolated so that it no longer constitutes a hazard.B. CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTIVE SYSTEMSIf the explosion protection document based on a risk assessment does not state otherwise, equipment and protective systems for all places in which explosive atmospheres may occur must be selected on the basis of the categories set out in Directive 94/9/EC.In particular, the following categories of equipment must be used in the zones indicated, provided they are suitable for gases, vapours or mists and/or dusts as appropriate:- in zone 0 or zone 20, category 1 equipment,- in zone 1 or zone 21, category 1 or 2 equipment,- in zone 2 or zone 22, category 1, 2 or 3 equipment.ANNEX IIIWarning sign for places where explosive atmospheres may occur, pursuant to Article 7(3):Place where explosive atmospheres may occur>PIC FILE= \"L_2000023EN.006402.EPS\">Distinctive features:- triangular shape,- black letters on a yellow background with black edging (the yellow part to take up at least 50 % of the area of the sign).Member States may add other explanatory data if they wish.", "summary": "Risk of explosive atmospheres\nRisk of explosive atmospheres\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 1999/92/EC — minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt establishes minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres*.\nIt is the fifteenth individual directive within the meaning of Directive 89/391/EEC which introduces general rules to encourage improvements in the health and safety of workers at work.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive requires employers to:\ntake technical and/or organisational measures to: prevent the formation of explosive atmospheres,avoid the ignition of explosive atmospheres,mitigate the effects of an explosion in a way that ensures the health and safety of workers.\nensure that an ‘explosion protection document’, describing explosion protection measures and satisfying the requirements of Directive 89/391/EEC, is prepared and kept up to date;\ninform workers and/or their representatives of all the measures to be taken for their safety and health at work;\ntake the necessary steps to ensure that workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres receive appropriate training;\nensure that work equipment for use in places where explosive atmospheres may occur must comply with the minimum requirements laid down in the annex to the directive.\nWorkplaces which were already in use before 30 June 2003 and which contained places in which explosive atmospheres could occur had to comply with its minimum requirements within 3 years after that date.\nThe directive contains 3 annexes which concern:\nthe classification of places where explosive atmospheres may occur;\nthe minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres and criteria for the selection of equipment and protective systems;\nthe warning sign for places where explosive atmospheres may occur.\nIn 2003, the European Commission issues a non-mandatory guide to good practice in implementing the directive. It is being used alongside the directive concerning equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. EU countries should ensure that relevant information is made available to employers and refer them to this guide on good practice.\nDirective 2007/30/EC simplified the requirements on reporting to the Commission concerning the implementation of Directive 89/391/EEC and its various individual directives.
