Sufficient comparability must be ensured at Community level as regards methodology, definitions and the programme of the statistical data and the metadata.\n(2)\nPeriodic statistical data on the population and the main family, social, economic and housing characteristics of persons are necessary for the study and definition of regional, social and environmental policies affecting particular sectors of the Community. In particular, there is a need to collect detailed information on housing in support of various Community activities, such as the promotion of social inclusion and the monitoring of social cohesion at regional level, or the protection of the environment and the promotion of energy efficiency.\n(3)\nIn view of methodological and technological developments, best practices should be identified and the enhancement of the data sources and methodologies used for censuses in the Member States should be fostered.\n(4)\nIn order to ensure the comparability of the data provided by the Member States and for reliable overviews to be drawn up at Community level, the data used should refer to the same reference year.\n(5)\nIn accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (2), which constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation, it is necessary for the collection of statistics to conform to the principles of impartiality, in particular objectivity and scientific independence, as well as transparency, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.\n(6)\nThe transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality is governed by Regulation (EC) No 322/97 and Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities (3). Measures that are taken in accordance with those Regulations ensure the physical and logical protection of confidential data and that no unlawful disclosure or non-statistical use occurs when Community statistics are produced and disseminated.\n(7)\nIn the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice adopted on 24 February 2005 by the Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (4) and attached to the Recommendation of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities.\n(8)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the collection and compilation of comparable and comprehensive Community statistics on population and housing, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, due to the absence of common statistical features and quality requirements as well as a lack of methodological transparency, and can therefore, by way of a common statistical framework, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(9)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (5).\n(10)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to establish the conditions for the establishment of subsequent reference years and the adoption of the programme of the statistical data and the metadata. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(11)\nThe Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes common rules for the decennial provision of comprehensive data on population and housing.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘population’ shall mean the national, regional and local population at its usual residence at the reference date;\n(b)\n‘housing’ shall mean living quarters and buildings as well as housing arrangements and the relationship between the population and living quarters at the national, regional and local levels at the reference date;\n(c)\n‘buildings’ shall mean permanent buildings that contain living quarters designed for human habitation, or conventional dwellings that are reserved for seasonal or secondary use or that are vacant;\n(d)\n‘usual residence’ shall mean the place where a person normally spends the daily period of rest, regardless of temporary absences for purposes of recreation, holidays, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage.\nThe following persons alone shall be considered to be usual residents of the geographical area in question:\n(i)\nthose who have lived in their place of usual residence for a continuous period of at least 12 months before the reference date; or\n(ii)\nthose who arrived in their place of usual residence during the 12 months before the reference date with the intention of staying there for at least one year.\nWhere the circumstances described in point (i) or (ii) cannot be established, ‘usual residence’ shall mean the place of legal or registered residence;\n(e)\n‘reference date’ shall mean the date to which the data of the respective Member State refer, in accordance with Article 5(1);\n(f)\n‘national’ shall mean on the territory of a Member State;\n(g)\n‘regional’ shall mean at NUTS level 1, NUTS level 2 or NUTS level 3, as defined in the classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS), established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) in its version applicable at the reference date;\n(h)\n‘local’ shall mean at Local Administrative Units level 2 (LAU level 2);\n(i)\n‘essential features of population and housing censuses’ shall mean individual enumeration, simultaneity, universality within a defined territory, availability of small-area data and defined periodicity.\nArticle 3\nData submission\nMember States shall submit to the Commission (Eurostat) data on the population covering determined demographic, social and economic characteristics of persons, families and households, as well as on housing at a national, regional and local level, as set out in the Annex.\nArticle 4\nData sources\n1.

These include:\nconventional censuses;\nregister-based censuses;\na combination of conventional censuses and sample surveys;\na combination of register-based censuses and sample surveys;\na combination of register-based censuses and conventional censuses;\na combination of register-based censuses, sample surveys and conventional censuses; and\nappropriate surveys with rotating samples (rolling censuses).\nData protection\nEU countries must take all measures necessary to meet the requirements of data protection. Their own data protection rules are not affected by this regulation.\nData transmission\nEach EU country must determine a date to which its data refer (a reference date), which must fall in the reference year. The first reference year is 2011. Reference years fall on the first year of each decade.\nEU countries must inform Eurostat of any revision or correction of the statistics transmitted as well as of any changes in the chosen data sources and methodology. This must be done no later than 1 month before the release of the revised data.\nEU countries must provide Eurostat with final, validated and aggregated data and metadata within 27 months of the end of the reference year.\nTo fulfil the requirements of this regulation, in 2010 the European Commission adopted a first programme of the statistical data and of the metadata to be transmitted for the reference year 2011 and, in 2017, it adopted a second programme for the reference year 2021.\nEU countries transmit to Eurostat the data in accordance with the EU law on data transmission subject to statistical confidentiality as set out in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. They must ensure that the transmitted data do not permit the direct identification of the statistical units. Transmission is in electronic format and is in accordance with the specifications agreed by the European Statistical System Committee, the committee that assists and advises the Commission (Eurostat).\nQuality assessment\nEU countries must ensure that the data sources and the methodology used to satisfy the requirements of the regulation meet the essential features of population and housing censuses as laid down in the regulation, i.e.:\nindividual enumeration,\nsimultaneity,\nuniversality within a defined territory,\navailability of small-area data, and\ndefined periodicity.\nEU countries must provide Eurostat with a report on the quality of the data transmitted, outlining the extent to which the chosen data sources and methodology meet the essential features of population and housing censuses.\nThe Commission assesses the quality of the data transmitted. In cooperation with the EU countries’ competent authorities, it provides methodological recommendations designed to ensure the quality of the data and the metadata produced, in particular acknowledging the Conference of European Statisticians — Recommendations for the 2010 Censuses of Population and Housing.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 2 September 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor the EU to be able to develop its regional, social and environmental policies, it needs to have at its disposal comparable and reliable data on population and the main family, social, economic and housing characteristics of persons.\nFor more information, see:\nPopulation and housing census — Overview (Eurostat)\nPopulation and housing census — 2011 Census (Eurostat).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on population and housing censuses (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, pp. 14-20)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/881 of 23 May 2017 implementing Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on population and housing censuses, as regards the modalities and structure of the quality reports and the technical format for data transmission, and amending Regulation (EU) No 1151/2010 (OJ L 135, 24.5.2017, pp. 6-14)\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2017/712 of 20 April 2017 establishing the reference year and the programme of the statistical data and metadata for population and housing censuses provided for by Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 105, 21.4.2017, pp. 1-11)\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/543 of 22 March 2017 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on population and housing censuses as regards the technical specifications of the topics and of their breakdowns (OJ L 78, 23.3.2017, pp. 13-58)\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 1151/2010 of 8 December 2010 implementing Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on population and housing censuses, as regards the modalities and structure of the quality reports and the technical format for data transmission (OJ L 324, 9.12.2010, pp. 1-12)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1151/2010 have been incorporated into the original document.
