{"celex_id": "32014L0029", "reference": "29.3.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 96/45\nDIRECTIVE 2014/29/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 February 2014\non the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of simple pressure vessels\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 relating to simple pressure vessels (3) has been substantially amended (4). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (5) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking.\n(3)\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products (6) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Directive 2009/105/EC should be adapted to that Decision.\n(4)\nThis Directive covers simple pressure vessels which are new to the Union market when they are placed on the market; that is to say they are either new simple pressure vessels made by a manufacturer established in the Union or simple pressure vessels, whether new or second-hand, imported from a third country.\n(5)\nThis Directive should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling.\n(6)\nMember States should ensure on their territory the protection of the health and safety of persons, and the protection of domestic animals and property with regard to the hazards resulting from the leakage or bursting of simple pressure vessels.\n(7)\nEconomic operators should be responsible for the compliance of simple pressure vessels with this Directive, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of public interests, such as the health and safety of persons, and protection of domestic animals and property, and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(8)\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market simple pressure vessels which are in conformity with this Directive. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n(9)\nIn order to facilitate communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and end-users, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a website address in addition to the postal address.\n(10)\nThe manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure for simple pressure vessels. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n(11)\nIt is necessary to ensure that simple pressure vessels from third countries entering the Union market comply with this Directive, and in particular that the appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those simple pressure vessels. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that the simple pressure vessels they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Directive and that they do not place on the market simple pressure vessels which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure that conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that product marking and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.\n(12)\nWhen placing a simple pressure vessel on the market, every importer should indicate on the simple pressure vessel his name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which he can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the nature of the simple pressure vessel does not allow it.\n(13)\nThe distributor makes a simple pressure vessel available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer and should act with due care to ensure that its handling of the simple pressure vessel does not adversely affect the compliance of the simple pressure vessel.\n(14)\nAny economic operator that either places a simple pressure vessel on the market under its own name or trade mark or modifies a simple pressure vessel in such a way that compliance with this Directive may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.\n(15)\nDistributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the simple pressure vessel concerned.\n(16)\nEnsuring traceability of a simple pressure vessel throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates the market surveillance authoritiesâ€™ task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant simple pressure vessels available on the market. When keeping the information required under this Directive for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with a simple pressure vessel or to whom they have supplied a simple pressure vessel.\n(17)\nThis Directive should be limited to the expression of the essential safety requirements. In order to facilitate conformity assessment with those requirements it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for simple pressure vessels which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European Standardisation (7) for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements.\n(18)\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Directive.\n(19)\nIn order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that simple pressure vessels made available on the market comply with the essential safety requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, which include procedures from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules.\n(20)\nManufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information required under this Directive on the conformity of a simple pressure vessel with this Directive and other relevant Union harmonisation legislation.\n(21)\nTo ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to identify all applicable Union acts should be available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, that single EU declaration of conformity may be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.\n(22)\nThe CE marking, indicating the conformity of a simple pressure vessel, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking should be laid down in this Directive.\n(23)\nA check on compliance with the relevant essential safety requirements is necessary in order to provide effective protection for end-users and third parties.\n(24)\nThe conformity assessment procedures set out in this Directive require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n(25)\nExperience has shown that the criteria set out in Directive 2009/105/EC that conformity assessment bodies have to fulfil to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to ensure a uniformly high level of performance of notified bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n(26)\nIf a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards, it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Directive.\n(27)\nIn order to ensure a consistent level of conformity assessment quality it is also necessary to set requirements for the notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(28)\nThe system set out in this Directive should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.\n(29)\nTransparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.\n(30)\nConformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the simple pressure vessels to be placed on the Union market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(31)\nIt is necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification.\n(32)\nSince notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.\n(33)\nIn the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.\n(34)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to simple pressure vessels. This Directive should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.\n(35)\nMember States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that simple pressure vessels may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons. Simple pressure vessels should be considered as non-compliant with the essential safety requirements laid down in this Directive only under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.\n(36)\nDirective 2009/105/EC already provides for a safeguard procedure allowing the Commission to examine the justification for a measure taken by a Member State against simple pressure vessels it considers to be non-compliant. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with the aim of making it more efficient and of drawing on the expertise available in the Member States.\n(37)\nThe existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to simple pressure vessels presenting a risk to the health or safety of persons, or to domestic animals or property. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an earlier stage in respect of such simple pressure vessels.\n(38)\nWhere the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised standard.\n(39)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commissionâ€™s exercise of implementing powers (8).\n(40)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(41)\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to compliant simple pressure vessels which present a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection.\n(42)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to compliant simple pressure vessels which present a risk to the health or safety of persons, to domestic animals or to property, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(43)\nIn line with established practice, the committee set up by this Directive can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Directive raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure.\n(44)\nWhen matters relating to this Directive, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined, i.e. in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should in line with existing practice receive full information and documentation and, where appropriate, an invitation to attend such meetings.\n(45)\nThe Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant simple pressure vessels are justified or not.\n(46)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(47)\nIt is necessary to provide for reasonable transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market and putting into service, without the need to comply with further product requirements, of simple pressure vessels that have already been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 2009/105/EC before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive. Distributors should therefore be able to supply simple pressure vessels that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive.\n(48)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure that simple pressure vessels on the market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of health and safety of persons, as well as protection of domestic animals and property while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(49)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directive.\n(50)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and the dates of application of the Directives set out in Annex V, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n4.   Importers shall ensure that the vessel is accompanied by the instructions and safety information referred to in point 2 of Annex III, in a language which can be easily understood by end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned.\n5.   Importers shall ensure that, while a vessel in respect of which the product of PS Ã— V exceeds 50 bar.L is under their responsibility, its storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex I.\n6.   When deemed appropriate with regard to the risks presented by a vessel, importers shall, to protect the health and safety of end-users, carry out sample testing of vessels made available on the market, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming vessels and vessel recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.\n7.   Importers who consider or have reason to believe that a vessel which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that vessel into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate. Furthermore, where the vessel presents a risk, importers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the vessel available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n8.   For vessels of which the product of PS Ã— V exceeds 50 bar.L, importers shall, for 10 years after the vessel has been placed on the market, keep a copy of the EU declaration of conformity at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities and ensure that the technical documentation can be made available to those authorities, upon request.\n9.   Importers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation in paper or electronic form necessary to demonstrate the conformity of a vessel in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by vessels which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 9\nObligations of distributors\n1.   When making a vessel available on the market distributors shall act with due care in relation to the requirements of this Directive.\n2.   Before making available on the market a vessel of which the product of PS Ã— V exceeds 50 bar.L, distributors shall verify that the vessel bears the CE marking and the inscriptions provided for in point 1 of Annex III, that it is accompanied by the required documents and by instructions and safety information referred to in point 2 of Annex III in a language which can be easily understood by end-users in the Member State in which the vessel is to be made available on the market, and that the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the requirements set out in Article 6(5) and (6) and Article 8(3) respectively.\nWhere a distributor considers or has reason to believe that a vessel of which the product of PS Ã— V exceeds 50 bar.L is not in conformity with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex I, he shall not make the vessel available on the market until it has been brought into conformity. Furthermore, where the vessel presents a risk, the distributor shall inform the manufacturer or the importer to that effect as well as the market surveillance authorities.\nBefore making available on the market a vessel of which the product of PS Ã— V is 50 bar.L or less, distributors shall verify that the vessel bears the inscriptions provided for in point 1.2 of Annex III and is accompanied by the instructions and safety information referred to in point 2 of Annex III in a language which can be easily understood by end-users in the Member State in which the vessel is to be made available on the market, and that the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the requirements set out in Article 6(5) and (6) and Article 8(3) respectively.\n3.   Distributors shall ensure that, while a vessel of which the product of PS Ã— V exceeds 50 bar.L is under their responsibility, its storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex I.\n4.   Distributors who consider or have reason to believe that a vessel which they have made available on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall make sure that the corrective measures necessary to bring that vessel into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate, are taken. Furthermore, where the vessel presents a risk, distributors shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the vessel available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n5.

Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have sufficient reason to believe that a vessel covered by this Directive presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, or to domestic animals or property, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the vessel concerned covering all relevant requirements laid down in this Directive. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose.\nWhere, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the vessel does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the vessel into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the vessel from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the vessels concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the vesselâ€™s being made available on their national market, to withdraw the vessel from that market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n5.

Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the vessel concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal of the vessel from the market, are taken in respect of the vessel concerned without delay.\nArticle 36\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 35(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified or not.\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\n2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant vessel is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw that measure.\n3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the vessel is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 35(5) of this Directive, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\nArticle 37\nCompliant vessels which present a risk\n1.   Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 35(1), a Member State finds that although a vessel is in compliance with this Directive, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, to domestic animals or property, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the vessel concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the vessel from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the vessels concerned that he has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the vessel concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the vessel, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of implementing acts whether the national measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures.\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(3).\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of health and safety of persons, or of domestic animals or of property, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(4).\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\nArticle 38\nFormal non-compliance\n1.

It repeals Directive 2009/105/EC with effect from 20 April 2016.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nThe directive updates the existing EU rules on the placing on the market and putting into service of simple pressure vessels. This is part of the effort to modernise European law in a wide range of industrial sectors so as to simplify the rules, reduce administrative burdens and establish clearer and more consistent rules.\nFor more information, see the European Commissionâ€™s simple pressure vessels website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2014/29/EU\n18.4.2014.\n                        Articles 1, 3, 4 and 5 and Annexes I and III apply from 20.4.2016\n19.4.2016\nOJ L 96, 29.3.2014, pp. 45-78.\nlast update 17.02.2015", "tags": ["marketing standard", "approximation of laws", "market supervision", "safety standard", "technical standard", "pressure equipment", "EC conformity marking"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
