The guarantees provided for in this resolution will apply to the examination  of asylum applications within the meaning of Article 3 of the Dublin Convention, with the exception  of procedures to determine the Member State responsible under the said Convention. The specific  guarantees applicable to those procedures will be determined by the Executive Committee set up by  the Dublin Convention. II. Universal principles concerning fair and effective asylum procedure 1. Asylum procedures will be applied in full compliance with the 1951 Geneva Convention, and the  1967 New York Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and other obligations under international  law in respect of refugees and human rights. In particular, the procedures will comply fully with  Article 1 of the 1951 Convention concerning the definition of a refugee, Article 33 relating to the  principle of 'non-refoulement` and Article 35 concerning cooperation with the Office of the UNHCR,  including the facilitation of its duty of supervising the application of the Convention. 2. In order to ensure effectively the principle of 'non-refoulement`, no expulsion measure will be  carried out as long as no decision has been taken on the asylum application. III. Guarantees concerning the examination of asylum applications 3. The regulations on access to the asylum procedure, the basic features of the asylum procedure  itself and the designation of the authorities responsible for examination of asylum applications  are to be laid down in the individual Member State's legislation. 4. Asylum applications will be examined by an authority fully qualified in the field of asylum and  refugee matters. Decisions will be taken independently in the sense that all asylum applications  will be examined and decided upon individually, objectively and impartially. 5. When examining an application for asylum the competent authority must, of its own initiative  take into consideration and seek to establish all the relevant facts and give the applicant the  opportunity to present a substantial description of the circumstances of the case and to prove  them. For his part the applicant must present all the facts and circumstances known to him and give  access to all the available evidence. Recognition of refugee status is not dependent on the production of any particular formal  evidence. 6. The authorities responsible for the examination of the asylum application must be fully  qualified in the field of asylum and refugee matters. To this effect, they must: - have at their disposal specialized personnel with the necessary knowledge and experience in the  field of asylum and refugee matters, who have an understanding of an applicant's particular  situation, - have access to precise and up-to-date information from various sources, including information  from the UNHCR, concerning the situation prevailing in the countries of origin of asylum-seekers  and in transit countries, - have the right to ask advice, whenever necessary, from experts on particular issues, e.g. a  medical issue or an issue of a cultural nature. 7. The authorities responsible for border controls and the local authorities with which asylum  applications are lodged must receive clear and detailed instructions so that the applications,  together with all other information available, can be forwarded without delay to the competent  authority for examination. 8. In the case of a negative decision, provision must be made for an appeal to a court or a review  authority which gives an independent ruling on individual cases under the conditions laid down in  paragraph 4. 9. Member States must ensure that the competent authorities are adequately provided with staff and  equipment so that they can discharge their duties promptly and under the best possible conditions. IV. Rights of asylum-seekers during examination, appeal and review procedures 10. An asylum-seeker must have an effective opportunity to lodge his asylum application as early as  possible. 11. Declarations made by the asylum-seeker and other details of his application are very sensitive  data, requiring protection. National law must therefore provide adequate data protection  guarantees, particularly as against the authorities of the asylum-seeker's country of origin. 12. As long as the asylum application has not been decided on, the general principle applies that  the applicant is allowed to remain in the territory of the State in which his application has been  lodged or is being examined. 13. Asylum-seekers must be informed of the procedure to be followed and of their rights and  obligations during the procedure, in a language which they can understand. In particular: - they must be given the services of an interpreter, whenever necessary, for submitting their case  to the authorities concerned. These services must be paid for out of public funds, if the  interpreter is called upon by the competent authorities, - in accordance with the rules of the Member State concerned, they may call in a legal adviser or  other counsellor to assist them during the procedure, - they must be given the opportunity, at all stages of the procedure, to communicate with the  Office of the UNHCR or with other refugee organizations which may be working on behalf of the UNHCR  in the Member State concerned, and vice versa. In addition, asylum-seekers may enter into contact with other refugee organizations under  procedures laid down by the Member States. The opportunity for an asylum-seeker to communicate with the UNHCR and other refugee organizations  need not necessarily prevent implementation of a decision, - the representative of the Office of the UNHCR must be given the opportunity to be informed of the  course of the procedure, to learn about the decisions of the competent authorities and to submit  his observations. 14. Before a final decision is taken on the asylum application, the asylum-seeker must be given the  opportunity of a personal interview with an official qualified under national law. 15. The decision on the asylum application must be communicated to the asylum-seeker in writing. If  the application is rejected, the asylum-seeker must be informed of the reasons and of any  possibility of having the decision reviewed. The asylum-seeker must have the opportunity, inasmuch  as national law so provides, to acquaint himself with or be informed of the main purport of the  decision and any possibility of appeal, in a language which he understands. 16. The asylum-seeker must be given an adequate period of time within which to appeal and to  prepare his case when requesting review of the decision. These time limits must be communicated to  the asylum-seeker in good time. 17. Until a decision has been taken on the appeal, the general principle will apply that the  asylum-seeker may remain in the territory of the Member State concerned. Where the national law of  a Member State permits a derogation from this principle in certain cases, the asylum-seeker should  at least be able to apply to the bodies referred to in paragraph 8 (court or independent review  authority) for leave to remain in the territory of the Member State temporarily during procedures  before those bodies, on the grounds of the particular circumstances of his case; no expulsion may  take place until a decision has been taken on this application. Manifestly unfounded asylum applications 18. Manifestly unfounded asylum applications within the meaning of the resolution adopted by the  Ministers responsible for immigration at their meeting on 30 November and 1 December 1992 will be  dealt with in accordance with that resolution. Subject to the principles laid down therein, the  guarantees laid down in the present resolution will apply. 19. By way of derogation from paragraph 8, Member States may exclude the possibility of lodging an  appeal against a decision to reject an application if, instead, an independent body which is  distinct from the examining authority has already confirmed the decision. 20. The Member States observe that, with due regard for the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, there  should be no de facto or de jure grounds for granting refugee status to an asylum applicant who is  a national of another Member State. On this basis, a particularly rapid or simplified procedure will be applied to the application for  asylum lodged by a national of another Member State, in accordance with each Member State's rules  and practice, it being specified that the Member States continue to be obliged to examine  individually every application for asylum, as provided by the Geneva Convention to which the Treaty  on European Union refers. 21. Member States may provide for exceptions to the principle in paragraph 17 in limited cases,  under national law, when, in consideration of objective criteria extraneous to the application  itself, an application is manifestly unfounded in accordance with points 9 and 10 of the resolution  adopted by the Ministers responsible for immigration on 30 November and 1 December 1992. However,  in such cases it should at least be guaranteed that the decision on the application is taken at a  high level and that additional sufficient safeguards (e.g. the same assessment, before the  execution of the decision, by another authority which must be of a central nature and have the  necessary knowledge and experience in the field of asylum and refugee law) ensure the correctness  of the decision. 22. Member States may provide for exceptions to the principle in paragraph 17 with respect to  asylum applications where, under national law, the host third-country concept is applicable in  accordance with the resolution adopted by the Ministers responsible for immigration at their  meeting on 30 November and 1 December 1992. In such cases Member States may also provide, by way of  derogation from paragraph 15, that the decision rejecting the application, its underlying reasons  and the asylum-seeker's rights may be communicated to him orally instead of in writing. Upon  request, the decision will be confirmed in writing. The third-country authorities must, where  necessary, be informed that the asylum application was not examined as to substance. Asylum applications at the border 23. Member States will adopt administrative measures ensuring that any asylum-seeker arriving at  their frontiers is afforded an opportunity to lodge an asylum application. 24. Member States may, inasmuch as national law so provides, apply special procedures to establish,  prior to the decision on admission, whether or not the application for asylum is manifestly  unfounded. No expulsion measure will be carried out during this procedure. Where an application for asylum is manifestly unfounded, the asylum-seeker may be refused  admission. In such cases, the national law of a Member State may permit an exception to the general  principle of the suspensive effect of the appeal (paragraph 17). However, it must at least be  ensured that the decision on the refusal of admission is taken by a ministry or comparable central  authority and that additional sufficient safeguards (for example, prior examination by another  central authority) ensure the correctness of the decision. Such authorities must be fully qualified  in asylum and refugee matters. 25. In addition, where, under national law, the host third country concept is applicable in  accordance with the resolution adopted by the Ministers responsible for immigration at their  meeting on 30 November and 1 December 1992, Member States may provide for exceptions to the  principles in paragraphs 7 and 17. Member States may also provide, by way of derogation from  paragraph 15, that the decision rejecting the application, its underlying reasons and any  possibility of appeal may be communicated to the asylum-seeker orally instead of in writing. Upon  request, the decision will be confirmed in writing. The procedure in the cases referred to in the first sentence of the preceding subparagraph may be  carried out before the decision on admission has been taken. In such cases, admission may be  refused. V. Additional safeguards for unaccompanied minors and women Unaccompanied minors 26. Provision must be made for unaccompanied minors seeking asylum to be represented by a  specifically appointed adult or institution if they do not have capacity under national law. During  the interview, unaccompanied minors may be accompanied by that adult or representatives of that  institution. These persons are to protect the child's interests. 27. When an application for asylum from an unaccompanied minor is examined, his mental development  and maturity will be taken into account. Women 28. Member States must endeavour to involve skilled female employees and female interpreters in the  asylum procedure where necessary, particularly where female asylum-seekers find it difficult to  present the grounds for their application in a comprehensive manner owing to the experiences they  have undergone or to their cultural origin. VI. Residence where the criteria for classification as a refugee are met 29. A Member State which, notwithstanding national provisions on application of the host  third-country concept, has examined an asylum application must grant refugee status to an  asylum-seeker fulfilling the criteria of Article 1 of the Geneva Convention. Member States may  provide, in accordance with their national law, that they will not make full use of the exclusion  clauses contained in the Geneva Convention. The refugee should in principle be granted the right of residence in the Member State concerned. VII. Other cases 30. This resolution does not affect the laws and regulations of the various Member States regarding  the cases covered in point 11 of the resolution on manifestly unfounded asylum applications adopted  by the Ministers responsible for immigration at their meeting on 30 November and 1 December 1992. VIII. Further action 31. Member States will take account of these principles in the case of all proposals for changes to  their national legislation. In addition, Member States will strive to bring their national  legislation into line with these principles by 1 January 1996. In conjunction with the Commission  and in consultation with the UNHCR, they will periodically review the operation of these principles  and consider whether any additional measures are necessary. IX. More favourable provisions 32. Member States have the right to enact national provisions on guarantees provided by procedures  applicable to asylum-seekers which are more favourable than those contained in the common minimum  guarantees.", "summary": "Minimum guarantees for asylum procedures\nMinimum guarantees for asylum procedures\n1) OBJECTIVE\nTo establish minimum guarantees for asylum procedures in Member States in compliance with the principles of the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 New York Protocol.\n2) ACT\nCouncil Resolution of 20 June 1995 on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures [Official Journal C 274, 19.09.1996].\n3) SUMMARY\nFollowing the entry into force of the 1990 Dublin Convention, the Member States wished to establish equivalent procedures for examining applications for asylum. To that end, minimum guarantees for procedures, to be complied with by all Member States, have been drawn up. Member States may enact more favourable national provisions.\nUniversal principles\nThe procedures for examining asylum applications must comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol, in particular as regards the definition of \"refugee\" and the principle of \"non-refoulement\" (no expulsion measure will be carried out as long as no decision has been taken on the asylum application), and must be carried out in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nGuarantees concerning the examination of asylum applications\nAll applications are examined individually, objectively and impartially. Applicants must present a substantial description of their case and all available evidence, although recognition of refugee status is not dependent on the production of any particular evidence.\nThe authorities responsible for the examination of the asylum application must be provided with a sufficient number of specialised personnel, precise information on the situation prevailing in the countries of origin and transit countries, and access to experts on particular issues (medical, cultural, etc.).\nThe authorities responsible for border controls and local authorities must receive clear instructions so that applications can be forwarded without delay to the competent authority.\nIf the asylum application is rejected, it is possible to appeal to a court or an independent review authority.\nRights of asylum-seekers during examination, appeal and review procedures\nAsylum-seekers may remain in the territory of the State in which the application has been lodged until a decision has been taken. During the procedure, they are entitled to the services of an interpreter or, if necessary, a legal adviser or other counsellor and may communicate with the Office of the UNHCR or other refugee organisations. Before a final decision is taken on the application, they are given the opportunity of a personal interview with a qualified official.\nManifestly unfounded applications are dealt with in accordance with the principles laid down in the Resolution of 30 November 1992. Applications from nationals of another Member State are covered by that Resolution since any Member State is regarded a priori as a reliable country. A particularly rapid procedure will be applied in such cases.\nAny asylum-seeker must be able to lodge an application at a frontier. The application may then be examined to establish, prior to the decision on admission, whether it is manifestly unfounded. However, where there is a host third country, there may be exceptions to the principle of \"non-refoulement\".\nAdditional safeguards for unaccompanied minors and women\nUnaccompanied minors must be represented by an appointed adult or institution that assists them during the procedure.\nMember States must endeavour to involve female employees and interpreters where necessary, particularly where female asylum-seekers find it difficult to present the grounds for their application owing to the experiences they have undergone or to their cultural origin.\nRight of residence\nApplicants who satisfy the criteria for refugee status must in principle be granted the right of residence in the Member State which examined the asylum application.\nMember States were to strive to bring their national legislation into line with these principles by 1 January 1996.\n4) follow-up work\nOn 20 September 2000, the Commission presented a proposal for a Council Directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status [COM(2000) 578 final - 2000/0238 CNS].\nCommunication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament. Towards a common asylum procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union, for persons granted asylum [COM(2000)755 final - Not published in the Official Journal]\nOn 22 November 2000, the Commission presented a Communication emphasising that harmonisation of asylum procedures could have immediate positive effects. The first would be to limit secondary movements of asylum seekers influenced by the diversity of rules and the rights granted following recognition of the right to asylum. An asylum seeker must be reasonably certain that, whichever Member State they approach, they will enjoy equivalent chances of obtaining proper protection.\nThe second would be to maintain the specific nature of the right to asylum vis-à-vis other forms of humanitarian protection. In addition, the Commission would like common rules on the exchange of information to be defined and to create a network between the authorities involved in order to facilitate the analysis of statistics, cooperation between the various authorities and the exchange of good practices.\nCommunication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on the common asylum policy, introducing an open coordination method. First report by the Commission on the application of Communication COM(2000)755 final of 22 November 2000 [COM(2001)710 final - Not published in the Official Journal].\nIn its Communication of 22 November 2000, the Commission set out its point of view on establishing a common asylum procedure, identifying objectives and proposing a method. The Communication of 28 November 2001 contains a more precise definition of the methods which might be applied to asylum policy. There will be consultations on these suggestions prior to a formal Commission proposal.\nThe report on a common asylum policy in the European Union will be submitted annually and will serve the interests of transparency and stimulate public debate. This year's report is broken down into six headings:\nimplementation of the legislative programme of the first stage and flanking measures (which makes reference to the legislation already in force and to proposals submitted, including Eurodac, proposal for a \" Dublin II \" regulation, the ARGO programme etc.);\nlink between international protection obligations and security (exclusion from refugee status, surrender, non-refoulement);\ncommon analysis (exchange of statistics and information on asylum and migrant flows);\nthe external dimension (enlargement, relations with the Balkans, the Russian Federation, relations with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees);\napplying the open coordination method to asylum policy (in practice, the Commission invites the Council to approve multiannual guidelines together with a timetable for achieving the objectives in the short, medium and long term. The Member States must then incorporate these guidelines into national legislation);\nrecommendations.\nLast updated: 18.08.2005", "tags": ["political asylum", "refugee", "aid to refugees", "right of asylum", "national law", "human rights"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs", "Asylum policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
