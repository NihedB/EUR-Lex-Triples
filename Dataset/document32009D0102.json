The funding was to be provided by:\nEU: €6.5 billion under its balance of payments assistance programme;\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF): around €12.5 billion;\nWorld Bank: €1 billion.\nIn exchange for the loans, Hungary agreed to make progress on:\nfiscal consolidation* and expenditure control;\nfiscal governance reform;\nprice stability;\nbanking sector stability;\nreforms of regulation and supervision in the financial sector;\nvarious structural reforms.\nOverall, Hungary received €5.5 billion from the EU and €8.7 billion from the IMF. It did not call on World Bank assistance.\nWith the end of the programme in November 2010, the European Commission began its post-programme surveillance, organising 6 review missions to the country.\nThe surveillance ended in January 2015 after Hungary had repaid over 70% of the EU loan.\nIn November 2011, Hungary requested a second round of financial assistance from the EU. In the end, this was not required because the country was able to finance itself on the international markets.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt applied from 5 November 2008.\nBACKGROUND\nIn February 2002, the Council of the European Union gave the EU the power to grant loans to EU countries experiencing, or threatened with, difficulties in their balance of payments or capital movements.\nThis financial assistance is only available to countries which do not use the euro.\nHungary first applied for assistance in October 2008 due to serious market turbulence and the government's difficulties in refinancing its debt.\nFor more information, see:\n‘Balance-of-payments assistance to Hungary’ on the European Commission's website.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nFiscal consolidation: the process of reducing government deficits and debt accumulation.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2009/102/EC of 4 November 2008 providing Community medium-term financial assistance for Hungary (OJ L 37, 6.2.2009, pp. 5–6)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments (OJ L 53, 23.2.2002, pp. 1–3)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 have been incorporated in the original text.
