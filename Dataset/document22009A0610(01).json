An insurer domiciled in a State bound by this Convention may be sued:\n(a)\nin the courts of the State where he is domiciled; or\n(b)\nin another State bound by this Convention, in the case of actions brought by the policyholder, the insured or a beneficiary, in the courts for the place where the plaintiff is domiciled; or\n(c)\nif he is a co-insurer, in the courts of a State bound by this Convention in which proceedings are brought against the leading insurer.\n2.   An insurer who is not domiciled in a State bound by this Convention but has a branch, agency or other establishment in one of the States bound by this Convention shall, in disputes arising out of the operations of the branch, agency or establishment, be deemed to be domiciled in that State.\nArticle 10\nIn respect of liability insurance or insurance of immovable property, the insurer may in addition be sued in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred. The same applies if movable and immovable property are covered by the same insurance policy and both are adversely affected by the same contingency.\nArticle 11\n1.

The provisions of this Section shall not affect the right to bring a counter-claim in the court in which, in accordance with this Section, the original claim is pending.\nArticle 13\nThe provisions of this Section may be departed from only by an agreement:\n1.\nwhich is entered into after the dispute has arisen; or\n2.\nwhich allows the policyholder, the insured or a beneficiary to bring proceedings in courts other than those indicated in this Section; or\n3.\nwhich is concluded between a policyholder and an insurer, both of whom are at the time of conclusion of the contract domiciled or habitually resident in the same State bound by this Convention, and which has the effect of conferring jurisdiction on the courts of that State even if the harmful event were to occur abroad, provided that such an agreement is not contrary to the law of that State; or\n4.\nwhich is concluded with a policyholder who is not domiciled in a State bound by this Convention, except insofar as the insurance is compulsory or relates to immovable property in a State bound by this Convention; or\n5.\nwhich relates to a contract of insurance insofar as it covers one or more of the risks set out in Article 14.\nArticle 14\nThe following are the risks referred to in Article 13(5):\n1.\nany loss of or damage to:\n(a)\nseagoing ships, installations situated offshore or on the high seas, or aircraft, arising from perils which relate to their use for commercial purposes;\n(b)\ngoods in transit, other than passengers' baggage, where the transit consists of or includes carriage by such ships or aircraft;\n2.\nany liability, other than for bodily injury to passengers or loss of or damage to their baggage:\n(a)\narising out of the use or operation of ships, installations or aircraft as referred to in point 1(a) insofar as, in respect of the latter, the law of the State bound by this Convention in which such aircraft are registered does not prohibit agreements on jurisdiction regarding insurance of such risks;\n(b)\nfor loss or damage caused by goods in transit as described in point 1(b);\n3.\nany financial loss connected with the use or operation of ships, installations or aircraft as referred to in point 1(a), in particular loss of freight or charter-hire;\n4.\nany risk or interest connected with any of those referred to in points 1 to 3;\n5.\nnotwithstanding points 1 to 4, all large risks.\nSECTION 4\nJurisdiction over consumer contracts\nArticle 15\n1.   In matters relating to a contract concluded by a person, the consumer, for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside his trade or profession, jurisdiction shall be determined by this Section, without prejudice to Articles 4 and 5(5), if:\n(a)\nit is a contract for the sale of goods on instalment credit terms; or\n(b)\nit is a contract for a loan repayable by instalments, or for any other form of credit, made to finance the sale of goods; or\n(c)\nin all other cases, the contract has been concluded with a person who pursues commercial or professional activities in the State bound by this Convention of the consumer's domicile or, by any means, directs such activities to that State or to several States including that State, and the contract falls within the scope of such activities.\n2.   Where a consumer enters into a contract with a party who is not domiciled in the State bound by this Convention but has a branch, agency or other establishment in one of the States bound by this Convention, that party shall, in disputes arising out of the operations of the branch, agency or establishment, be deemed to be domiciled in that State.\n3.   This section shall not apply to a contract of transport other than a contract which, for an inclusive price, provides for a combination of travel and accommodation.\nArticle 16\n1.   A consumer may bring proceedings against the other party to a contract either in the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which that party is domiciled or in the courts for the place where the consumer is domiciled.\n2.   Proceedings may be brought against a consumer by the other party to the contract only in the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the consumer is domiciled.\n3.   This Article shall not affect the right to bring a counter-claim in the court in which, in accordance with this Section, the original claim is pending.\nArticle 17\nThe provisions of this Section may be departed from only by an agreement:\n1.\nwhich is entered into after the dispute has arisen; or\n2.\nwhich allows the consumer to bring proceedings in courts other than those indicated in this Section; or\n3.\nwhich is entered into by the consumer and the other party to the contract, both of whom are at the time of conclusion of the contract domiciled or habitually resident in the same State bound by this Convention, and which confers jurisdiction on the courts of that State, provided that such an agreement is not contrary to the law of that State.\nSECTION 5\nJurisdiction over individual contracts of employment\nArticle 18\n1.   In matters relating to individual contracts of employment, jurisdiction shall be determined by this Section, without prejudice to Articles 4 and 5(5).\n2.   Where an employee enters into an individual contract of employment with an employer who is not domiciled in a State bound by this Convention but has a branch, agency or other establishment in one of the States bound by this Convention, the employer shall, in disputes arising out of the operations of the branch, agency or establishment, be deemed to be domiciled in that State.\nArticle 19\nAn employer domiciled in a State bound by this Convention may be sued:\n1.\nin the courts of the State where he is domiciled; or\n2.\nin another State bound by this Convention:\n(a)\nin the courts for the place where the employee habitually carries out his work or in the courts for the last place where he did so; or\n(b)\nif the employee does not or did not habitually carry out his work in any one country, in the courts for the place where the business which engaged the employee is or was situated.\nArticle 20\n1.   An employer may bring proceedings only in the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the employee is domiciled.\n2.   The provisions of this Section shall not affect the right to bring a counter-claim in the court in which, in accordance with this Section, the original claim is pending.\nArticle 21\nThe provisions of this Section may be departed from only by an agreement on jurisdiction:\n1.\nwhich is entered into after the dispute has arisen; or\n2.\nwhich allows the employee to bring proceedings in courts other than those indicated in this Section.\nSECTION 6\nExclusive jurisdiction\nArticle 22\nThe following courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction, regardless of domicile:\n1.\nin proceedings which have as their object rights in rem in immovable property or tenancies of immovable property, the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the property is situated.\nHowever, in proceedings which have as their object tenancies of immovable property concluded for temporary private use for a maximum period of six consecutive months, the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the defendant is domiciled shall also have jurisdiction, provided that the tenant is a natural person and that the landlord and the tenant are domiciled in the same State bound by this Convention;\n2.\nin proceedings which have as their object the validity of the constitution, the nullity or the dissolution of companies or other legal persons or associations of natural or legal persons, or of the validity of the decisions of their organs, the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the company, legal person or association has its seat. In order to determine that seat, the court shall apply its rules of private international law;\n3.\nin proceedings which have as their object the validity of entries in public registers, the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the register is kept;\n4.\nin proceedings concerned with the registration or validity of patents, trade marks, designs, or other similar rights required to be deposited or registered, irrespective of whether the issue is raised by way of an action or as a defence, the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the deposit or registration has been applied for, has taken place or is, under the terms of a Community instrument or an international convention, deemed to have taken place.\nWithout prejudice to the jurisdiction of the European Patent Office under the Convention on the grant of European patents, signed at Munich on 5 October 1973, the courts of each State bound by this Convention shall have exclusive jurisdiction, regardless of domicile, in proceedings concerned with the registration or validity of any European patent granted for that State irrespective of whether the issue is raised by way of an action or as a defence;\n5.\nin proceedings concerned with the enforcement of judgments, the courts of the State bound by this Convention in which the judgment has been or is to be enforced.\nSECTION 7\nProrogation of jurisdiction\nArticle 23\n1.   If the parties, one or more of whom is domiciled in a State bound by this Convention, have agreed that a court or the courts of a State bound by this Convention are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which have arisen or which may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, that court or those courts shall have jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Such an agreement conferring jurisdiction shall be either:\n(a)\nin writing or evidenced in writing; or\n(b)\nin a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves; or\n(c)\nin international trade or commerce, in a form which accords with a usage of which the parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such trade or commerce is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade or commerce concerned.\n2.   Any communication by electronic means which provides a durable record of the agreement shall be equivalent to ‘writing’.\n3.   Where such an agreement is concluded by parties, none of whom is domiciled in a State bound by this Convention, the courts of other States bound by this Convention shall have no jurisdiction over their disputes unless the court or courts chosen have declined jurisdiction.\n4.   The court or courts of a State bound by this Convention on which a trust instrument has conferred jurisdiction shall have exclusive jurisdiction in any proceedings brought against a settlor, trustee or beneficiary, if relations between these persons or their rights or obligations under the trust are involved.\n5.   Agreements or provisions of a trust instrument conferring jurisdiction shall have no legal force if they are contrary to the provisions of Articles 13, 17 or 21, or if the courts whose jurisdiction they purport to exclude have exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of Article 22.\nArticle 24\nApart from jurisdiction derived from other provisions of this Convention, a court of a State bound by this Convention before which a defendant enters an appearance shall have jurisdiction. This rule shall not apply where appearance was entered to contest the jurisdiction, or where another court has exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of Article 22.\nSECTION 8\nExamination as to jurisdiction and admissibility\nArticle 25\nWhere a court of a State bound by this Convention is seised of a claim which is principally concerned with a matter over which the courts of another State bound by this Convention have exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of Article 22, it shall declare of its own motion that it has no jurisdiction.\nArticle 26\n1.   Where a defendant domiciled in one State bound by this Convention is sued in a court of another State bound by this Convention and does not enter an appearance, the court shall declare of its own motion that it has no jurisdiction unless its jurisdiction is derived from the provisions of this Convention.\n2.   The court shall stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown that the defendant has been able to receive the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence, or that all necessary steps have been taken to this end.\n3.   Instead of the provisions of paragraph 2, Article 15 of the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial matters shall apply if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted pursuant to that Convention.\n4.   Member States of the European Community bound by Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 or by the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, signed at Brussels on 19 October 2005, shall apply in their mutual relations the provision in Article 19 of that Regulation if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted pursuant to that Regulation or that Agreement.\nSECTION 9\nLis pendens — related actions\nArticle 27\n1.   Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different States bound by this Convention, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\n2.   Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established, any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court.\nArticle 28\n1.   Where related actions are pending in the courts of different States bound by this Convention, any court other than the court first seised may stay its proceedings.\n2.   Where these actions are pending at first instance, any court other than the court first seised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation thereof.\n3.   For the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\nArticle 29\nWhere actions come within the exclusive jurisdiction of several courts, any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court.\nArticle 30\nFor the purposes of this Section, a court shall be deemed to be seised:\n1.\nat the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court, provided that the plaintiff has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have service effected on the defendant; or\n2.\nif the document has to be served before being lodged with the court at the time when it is received by the authority responsible for service, provided that the plaintiff has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have the document lodged with the court.\nSECTION 10\nProvisional, including protective, measures\nArticle 31\nApplication may be made to the courts of a State bound by this Convention for such provisional, including protective, measures as may be available under the law of that State, even if, under this Convention, the courts of another State bound by this Convention have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.\nTITLE III\nRECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT\nArticle 32\nFor the purposes of this Convention, ‘judgment’ means any judgment given by a court or tribunal of a State bound by this Convention, whatever the judgment may be called, including a decree, order, decision or writ of execution, as well as the determination of costs or expenses by an officer of the court.\nSECTION 1\nRecognition\nArticle 33\n1.   A judgment given in a State bound by this Convention shall be recognised in the other States bound by this Convention without any special procedure being required.\n2.   Any interested party who raises the recognition of a judgment as the principal issue in a dispute may, in accordance with the procedures provided for in Sections 2 and 3 of this Title, apply for a decision that the judgment be recognised.\n3.   If the outcome of proceedings in a court of a State bound by this Convention depends on the determination of an incidental question of recognition that court shall have jurisdiction over that question.\nArticle 34\nA judgment shall not be recognised:\n1.\nif such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the State in which recognition is sought;\n2.\nwhere it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so;\n3.\nif it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the State in which recognition is sought;\n4.\nif it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another State bound by this Convention or in a third State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the State addressed.\nArticle 35\n1.   Moreover, a judgment shall not be recognised if it conflicts with Sections 3, 4 or 6 of Title II, or in a case provided for in Article 68. A judgment may furthermore be refused recognition in any case provided for in Article 64(3) or 67(4).\n2.   In its examination of the grounds of jurisdiction referred to in the foregoing paragraph, the court or authority applied to shall be bound by the findings of fact on which the court of the State of origin based its jurisdiction.\n3.   Subject to the provisions of paragraph 1, the jurisdiction of the court of the State of origin may not be reviewed. The test of public policy referred to in Article 34(1) may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction.\nArticle 36\nUnder no circumstances may a foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance.\nArticle 37\n1.   A court of a State bound by this Convention in which recognition is sought of a judgment given in another State bound by this Convention may stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal against the judgment has been lodged.\n2.   A court of a State bound by this Convention in which recognition is sought of a judgment given in Ireland or the United Kingdom may stay the proceedings if enforcement is suspended in the State of origin, by reason of an appeal.\nSECTION 2\nEnforcement\nArticle 38\n1.   A judgment given in a State bound by this Convention and enforceable in that State shall be enforced in another State bound by this Convention when, on the application of any interested party, it has been declared enforceable there.\n2.   However, in the United Kingdom, such a judgment shall be enforced in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Northern Ireland when, on the application of any interested party, it has been registered for enforcement in that part of the United Kingdom.\nArticle 39\n1.   The application shall be submitted to the court or competent authority indicated in the list in Annex II.\n2.   The local jurisdiction shall be determined by reference to the place of domicile of the party against whom enforcement is sought, or to the place of enforcement.\nArticle 40\n1.   The procedure for making the application shall be governed by the law of the State in which enforcement is sought.\n2.   The applicant must give an address for service of process within the area of jurisdiction of the court applied to. However, if the law of the State in which enforcement is sought does not provide for the furnishing of such an address, the applicant shall appoint a representative ad litem.\n3.   The documents referred to in Article 53 shall be attached to the application.\nArticle 41\nThe judgment shall be declared enforceable immediately on completion of the formalities in Article 53 without any review under Articles 34 and 35. The party against whom enforcement is sought shall not at this stage of the proceedings be entitled to make any submissions on the application.\nArticle 42\n1.   The decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability shall forthwith be brought to the notice of the applicant in accordance with the procedure laid down by the law of the State in which enforcement is sought.\n2.   The declaration of enforceability shall be served on the party against whom enforcement is sought, accompanied by the judgment, if not already served on that party.\nArticle 43\n1.   The decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability may be appealed against by either party.\n2.   The appeal is to be lodged with the court indicated in the list in Annex III.\n3.   The appeal shall be dealt with in accordance with the rules governing procedure in contradictory matters.\n4.   If the party against whom enforcement is sought fails to appear before the appellate court in proceedings concerning an appeal brought by the applicant, Article 26(2) to (4) shall apply even where the party against whom enforcement is sought is not domiciled in any of the States bound by this Convention.\n5.   An appeal against the declaration of enforceability is to be lodged within one month of service thereof. If the party against whom enforcement is sought is domiciled in a State bound by this Convention other than that in which the declaration of enforceability was given, the time for appealing shall be two months and shall run from the date of service, either on him in person or at his residence. No extension of time may be granted on account of distance.\nArticle 44\nThe judgment given on the appeal may be contested only by the appeal referred to in Annex IV.\nArticle 45\n1.   The court with which an appeal is lodged under Article 43 or Article 44 shall refuse or revoke a declaration of enforceability only on one of the grounds specified in Articles 34 and 35. It shall give its decision without delay.\n2.   Under no circumstances may the foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance.\nArticle 46\n1.   The court with which an appeal is lodged under Article 43 or Article 44 may, on the application of the party against whom enforcement is sought, stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal has been lodged against the judgment in the State of origin or if the time for such an appeal has not yet expired; in the latter case, the court may specify the time within which such an appeal is to be lodged.\n2.   Where the judgment was given in Ireland or the United Kingdom, any form of appeal available in the State of origin shall be treated as an ordinary appeal for the purposes of paragraph 1.\n3.   The court may also make enforcement conditional on the provision of such security as it shall determine.\nArticle 47\n1.   When a judgment must be recognised in accordance with this Convention, nothing shall prevent the applicant from availing himself of provisional, including protective, measures in accordance with the law of the State requested without a declaration of enforceability under Article 41 being required.\n2.   The declaration of enforceability shall carry with it the power to proceed to any protective measures.\n3.   During the time specified for an appeal pursuant to Article 43(5) against the declaration of enforceability and until any such appeal has been determined, no measures of enforcement may be taken other than protective measures against the property of the party against whom enforcement is sought.\nArticle 48\n1.   Where a foreign judgment has been given in respect of several matters and the declaration of enforceability cannot be given for all of them, the court or competent authority shall give it for one or more of them.\n2.   An applicant may request a declaration of enforceability limited to parts of a judgment.\nArticle 49\nA foreign judgment which orders a periodic payment by way of a penalty shall be enforceable in the State in which enforcement is sought only if the amount of the payment has been finally determined by the courts of the State of origin.\nArticle 50\n1.   An applicant who in the State of origin has benefited from complete or partial legal aid or exemption from costs or expenses shall be entitled, in the procedure provided for in this Section, to benefit from the most favourable legal aid or the most extensive exemption from costs or expenses provided for by the law of the State addressed.\n2.   However, an applicant who requests the enforcement of a decision given by an administrative authority in Denmark, in Iceland or in Norway in respect of maintenance may, in the State addressed, claim the benefits referred to in paragraph 1 if he presents a statement from the Danish, Icelandic, or Norwegian Ministry of Justice to the effect that he fulfils the economic requirements to qualify for the grant of complete or partial legal aid or exemption from costs or expenses.\nArticle 51\nNo security, bond or deposit, however described, shall be required of a party who in one State bound by this Convention, applies for enforcement of a judgment given in another State bound by this Convention on the ground that he is a foreign national or that he is not domiciled or resident in the State in which enforcement is sought.\nArticle 52\nIn proceedings for the issue of a declaration of enforceability, no charge, duty or fee calculated by reference to the value of the matter at issue may be levied in the State in which enforcement is sought.\nSECTION 3\nCommon provisions\nArticle 53\n1.   A party seeking recognition or applying for a declaration of enforceability shall produce a copy of the judgment which satisfies the conditions necessary to establish its authenticity.\n2.   A party applying for a declaration of enforceability shall also produce the certificate referred to in Article 54, without prejudice to Article 55.\nArticle 54\nThe court or competent authority of a State bound by this Convention where a judgment was given shall issue, at the request of any interested party, a certificate using the standard form in Annex V to this Convention.\nArticle 55\n1.   If the certificate referred to in Article 54 is not produced, the court or competent authority may specify a time for its production or accept an equivalent document or, if it considers that it has sufficient information before it, dispense with its production.\n2.   If the court or competent authority so requires, a translation of the documents shall be produced. The translation shall be certified by a person qualified to do so in one of the States bound by this Convention.\nArticle 56\nNo legalisation or other similar formality shall be required in respect of the documents referred to in Article 53 or Article 55(2), or in respect of a document appointing a representative ad litem.\nTITLE IV\nAUTHENTIC INSTRUMENTS AND COURT SETTLEMENTS\nArticle 57\n1.   A document which has been formally drawn up or registered as an authentic instrument and is enforceable in one State bound by this Convention shall, in another State bound by this Convention, be declared enforceable there, on application made in accordance with the procedures provided for in Article 38, et seq. The court with which an appeal is lodged under Article 43 or Article 44 shall refuse or revoke a declaration of enforceability only if enforcement of the instrument is manifestly contrary to public policy in the State addressed.\n2.   Arrangements relating to maintenance obligations concluded with administrative authorities or authenticated by them shall also be regarded as authentic instruments within the meaning of paragraph 1.\n3.   The instrument produced must satisfy the conditions necessary to establish its authenticity in the State of origin.\n4.   Section 3 of Title III shall apply as appropriate. The competent authority of a State bound by this Convention where an authentic instrument was drawn up or registered shall issue, at the request of any interested party, a certificate using the standard form in Annex VI to this Convention.\nArticle 58\nA settlement which has been approved by a court in the course of proceedings and is enforceable in the State bound by this Convention in which it was concluded shall be enforceable in the State addressed under the same conditions as authentic instruments. The court or competent authority of a State bound by this Convention where a court settlement was approved shall issue, at the request of any interested party, a certificate using the standard form in Annex V to this Convention.\nTITLE V\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 59\n1.   In order to determine whether a party is domiciled in the State bound by this Convention whose courts are seised of a matter, the court shall apply its internal law.\n2.   If a party is not domiciled in the State whose courts are seised of the matter, then, in order to determine whether the party is domiciled in another State bound by this Convention, the court shall apply the law of that State.\nArticle 60\n1.   For the purposes of this Convention, a company or other legal person or association of natural or legal persons is domiciled at the place where it has its:\n(a)\nstatutory seat; or\n(b)\ncentral administration; or\n(c)\nprincipal place of business.\n2.   For the purposes of the United Kingdom and Ireland ‘statutory seat’ means the registered office or, where there is no such office anywhere, the place of incorporation or, where there is no such place anywhere, the place under the law of which the formation took place.\n3.   In order to determine whether a trust is domiciled in the State bound by this Convention whose courts are seised of the matter, the court shall apply its rules of private international law.\nArticle 61\nWithout prejudice to any more favourable provisions of national laws, persons domiciled in a State bound by this Convention who are being prosecuted in the criminal courts of another State bound by this Convention of which they are not nationals for an offence which was not intentionally committed may be defended by persons qualified to do so, even if they do not appear in person. However, the court seised of the matter may order appearance in person; in the case of failure to appear, a judgment given in the civil action without the person concerned having had the opportunity to arrange for his defence need not be recognised or enforced in the other States bound by this Convention.\nArticle 62\nFor the purposes of this Convention, the expression ‘court’ shall include any authorities designated by a State bound by this Convention as having jurisdiction in the matters falling within the scope of this Convention.\nTITLE VI\nTRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 63\n1.   This Convention shall apply only to legal proceedings instituted and to documents formally drawn up or registered as authentic instruments after its entry into force in the State of origin and, where recognition or enforcement of a judgment or authentic instruments is sought, in the State addressed.\n2.   However, if the proceedings in the State of origin were instituted before the entry into force of this Convention, judgments given after that date shall be recognised and enforced in accordance with Title III:\n(a)\nif the proceedings in the State of origin were instituted after the entry into force of the Lugano Convention of 16 September 1988 both in the State of origin and in the State addressed;\n(b)\nin all other cases, if jurisdiction was founded upon rules which accorded with those provided for either in Title II or in a convention concluded between the State of origin and the State addressed which was in force when the proceedings were instituted.\nTITLE VII\nRELATIONSHIP TO COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 44/2001 AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nArticle 64\n1.   This Convention shall not prejudice the application by the Member States of the European Community of the Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, as well as any amendments thereof, of the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, signed at Brussels on 27 September 1968, and of the Protocol on interpretation of that Convention by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, signed at Luxembourg on 3 June 1971, as amended by the Conventions of Accession to the said Convention and the said Protocol by the States acceding to the European Communities, as well as of the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed at Brussels on 19 October 2005.\n2.   However, this Convention shall in any event be applied:\n(a)\nin matters of jurisdiction, where the defendant is domiciled in the territory of a State where this Convention but not an instrument referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article applies, or where Articles 22 or 23 of this Convention confer jurisdiction on the courts of such a State;\n(b)\nin relation to lis pendens or to related actions as provided for in Articles 27 and 28, when proceedings are instituted in a State where the Convention but not an instrument referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article applies and in a State where this Convention as well as an instrument referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article apply;\n(c)\nin matters of recognition and enforcement, where either the State of origin or the State addressed is not applying an instrument referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3.   In addition to the grounds provided for in Title III, recognition or enforcement may be refused if the ground of jurisdiction on which the judgment has been based differs from that resulting from this Convention and recognition or enforcement is sought against a party who is domiciled in a State where this Convention but not an instrument referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article applies, unless the judgment may otherwise be recognised or enforced under any rule of law in the State addressed.\nArticle 65\nSubject to the provisions of Articles 63(2), 66 and 67, this Convention shall, as between the States bound by this Convention, supersede the conventions concluded between two or more of them that cover the same matters as those to which this Convention applies. In particular, the conventions mentioned in Annex VII shall be superseded.\nArticle 66\n1.   The conventions referred to in Article 65 shall continue to have effect in relation to matters to which this Convention does not apply.\n2.   They shall continue to have effect in respect of judgments given and documents formally drawn up or registered as authentic instruments before the entry into force of this Convention.\nArticle 67\n1.   This Convention shall not affect any conventions by which the Contracting Parties and/or the States bound by this Convention are bound and which in relation to particular matters, govern jurisdiction or the recognition or enforcement of judgments. Without prejudice to obligations resulting from other agreements between certain Contracting Parties, this Convention shall not prevent Contracting Parties from entering into such conventions.\n2.   This Convention shall not prevent a court of a State bound by this Convention and by a convention on a particular matter from assuming jurisdiction in accordance with that convention, even where the defendant is domiciled in another State bound by this Convention which is not a party to that convention. The court hearing the action shall, in any event, apply Article 26 of this Convention.\n3.   Judgments given in a State bound by this Convention by a court in the exercise of jurisdiction provided for in a convention on a particular matter shall be recognised and enforced in the other States bound by this Convention in accordance with Title III of this Convention.\n4.   In addition to the grounds provided for in Title III, recognition or enforcement may be refused if the State addressed is not bound by the convention on a particular matter and the person against whom recognition or enforcement is sought is domiciled in that State, or, if the State addressed is a Member State of the European Community and in respect of conventions which would have to be concluded by the European Community, in any of its Member States, unless the judgment may otherwise be recognised or enforced under any rule of law in the State addressed.\n5.   Where a convention on a particular matter to which both the State of origin and the State addressed are parties lays down conditions for the recognition or enforcement of judgments, those conditions shall apply. In any event, the provisions of this Convention which concern the procedures for recognition and enforcement of judgments may be applied.\nArticle 68\n1.   This Convention shall not affect agreements by which States bound by this Convention undertook, prior to the entry into force of this Convention, not to recognise judgments given in other States bound by this Convention against defendants domiciled or habitually resident in a third State where, in cases provided for in Article 4, the judgment could only be founded on a ground of jurisdiction as specified in Article 3(2). Without prejudice to obligations resulting from other agreements between certain Contracting Parties, this Convention shall not prevent Contracting Parties from entering into such conventions.\n2.   However, a Contracting Party may not assume an obligation towards a third State not to recognise a judgment given in another State bound by this Convention by a court basing its jurisdiction on the presence within that State of property belonging to the defendant, or the seizure by the plaintiff of property situated there:\n(a)\nif the action is brought to assert or declare proprietary or possessory rights in that property, seeks to obtain authority to dispose of it, or arises from another issue relating to such property; or\n(b)\nif the property constitutes the security for a debt which is the subject-matter of the action.\nTITLE VIII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 69\n1.   The Convention shall be open for signature by the European Community, Denmark, and States which, at the time of the opening for signature, are Members of the European Free Trade Association.\n2.   This Convention shall be subject to ratification by the Signatories.

Any reference to the 1988 Lugano Convention in other instruments shall be understood as a reference to this Convention.\n7.   Insofar as the relations between the Member States of the European Community and the non-European territories referred to in Article 70(1)(b) are concerned, this Convention shall replace the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, signed at Brussels on 27 September 1968, and of the Protocol on interpretation of that Convention by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, signed at Luxembourg on 3 June 1971, as amended by the Conventions of Accession to the said Convention and the said Protocol by the States acceding to the European Communities, as of the date of the entry into force of this Convention with respect to these territories in accordance with Article 73(2).\nArticle 70\n1.

The Depositary shall transmit any information received pursuant to paragraph 1 to the other Contracting Parties prior to inviting the State concerned to accede in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4, the Depositary shall invite the State concerned to accede only if it has obtained the unanimous agreement of the Contracting Parties. The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to give their consent at the latest within one year after the invitation by the Depositary.\n4.

This Convention is concluded for an unlimited period.\n2.   Any Contracting Party may, at any time, denounce the Convention by sending a notification to the Depositary.\n3.   The denunciation shall take effect at the end of the calendar year following the expiry of a period of six months from the date of receipt by the Depositary of the notification of denunciation.\nArticle 75\nThe following are annexed to this Convention:\n—\na Protocol 1, on certain questions of jurisdiction, procedure and enforcement,\n—\na Protocol 2, on the uniform interpretation of this Convention and on the Standing Committee,\n—\na Protocol 3, on the application of Article 67 of this Convention,\n—\nAnnexes I through IV and Annex VII, with information related to the application of this Convention,\n—\nAnnexes V and VI, containing the certificates referred to in Articles 54, 58 and 57 of this Convention,\n—\nAnnex VIII, containing the authentic languages referred to in Article 79 of this Convention, and\n—\nAnnex IX, concerning the application of Article II of Protocol 1.\nThese Protocols and Annexes shall form an integral part of this Convention.\nArticle 76\nWithout prejudice to Article 77, any Contracting Party may request the revision of this Convention.

Judicial and extrajudicial documents drawn up in one State bound by this Convention which have to be served on persons in another State bound by this Convention shall be transmitted in accordance with the procedures laid down in the conventions and agreements applicable between these States.\n2.   Unless the Contracting Party on whose territory service is to take place objects by declaration to the Depositary, such documents may also be sent by the appropriate public officers of the State in which the document has been drawn up directly to the appropriate public officers of the State in which the addressee is to be found. In this case the officer of the State of origin shall send a copy of the document to the officer of the State applied to who is competent to forward it to the addressee. The document shall be forwarded in the manner specified by the law of the State applied to. The forwarding shall be recorded by a certificate sent directly to the officer of the State of origin.\n3.   Member States of the European Community bound by Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 or by the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, signed at Brussels on 19 October 2005, shall apply in their mutual relations that Regulation and that Agreement.\nArticle II\n1.   The jurisdiction specified in Articles 6(2) and 11 in actions on a warranty or guarantee or in any other third party proceedings may not be fully resorted to in the States bound by this Convention referred to in Annex IX. Any person domiciled in another State bound by this Convention may be sued in the courts of these States pursuant to the rules referred to in Annex IX.\n2.   At the time of ratification the European Community may declare that proceedings referred to in Articles 6(2) and 11 may not be resorted to in some other Member States and provide information on the rules that shall apply.\n3.   Judgments given in the other States bound by this Convention by virtue of Article 6(2) or Article 11 shall be recognised and enforced in the States mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 in accordance with Title III. Any effects which judgments given in these States may have on third parties by application of the provisions in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also be recognised in the other States bound by this Convention.\nArticle III\n1.   Switzerland reserves the right to declare upon ratification that it will not apply the following part of the provision in Article 34(2):\n‘unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so’.\nIf Switzerland makes such declaration, the other Contracting Parties shall apply the same reservation in respect of judgments rendered by the courts of Switzerland.\n2.   Contracting Parties may, in respect of judgments rendered in an acceding State referred to in Article 70(1)(c), by declaration reserve:\n(a)\nthe right mentioned in paragraph 1; and\n(b)\nthe right of an authority mentioned in Article 39, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 41, to examine of its own motion whether any of the grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of a judgment is present or not.\n3.   If a Contracting Party has made such a reservation towards an acceding State as referred to in paragraph 2, this acceding State may by declaration reserve the same right in respect of judgments rendered by the courts of that Contracting Party.\n4.   Except for the reservation mentioned in paragraph 1, the declarations are valid for periods of five years and are renewable at the end of such periods. The Contracting Party shall notify a renewal of a declaration referred to under paragraph 2 not later than six months prior to the end of such period.

Any court applying and interpreting this Convention shall pay due account to the principles laid down by any relevant decision concerning the provision(s) concerned or any similar provision(s) of the 1988 Lugano Convention and the instruments referred to in Article 64(1) of the Convention rendered by the courts of the States bound by this Convention and by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.\n2.   For the courts of Member States of the European Community, the obligation laid down in paragraph 1 shall apply without prejudice to their obligations in relation to the Court of Justice of the European Communities resulting from the Treaty establishing the European Community or from the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, signed at Brussels on 19 October 2005.\nArticle 2\nAny State bound by this Convention and which is not a Member State of the European Community is entitled to submit statements of case or written observations, in accordance with Article 23 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, where a court or tribunal of a Member State of the European Community refers to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling a question on the interpretation of this Convention or of the instruments referred to in Article 64(1) of this Convention.\nArticle 3\n1.   The Commission of the European Communities shall set up a system of exchange of information concerning relevant judgments delivered pursuant to this Convention as well as relevant judgments under the 1988 Lugano Convention and the instruments referred to in Article 64(1) of this Convention. This system shall be accessible to the public and contain judgments delivered by the courts of last instance and of the Court of Justice of the European Communities as well as judgments of particular importance which have become final and have been delivered pursuant to this Convention, the 1988 Lugano Convention, and the instruments referred to in Article 64(1) of this Convention. The judgments shall be classified and provided with an abstract.\nThe system shall comprise the transmission to the Commission by the competent authorities of the States bound by this Convention of judgments as referred to above delivered by the courts of these States.\n2.   A selection of cases of particular interest for the proper functioning of the Convention will be made by the Registrar of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, who shall present the selected case law at the meeting of experts in accordance with Article 5 of this Protocol.\n3.   Until the European Communities have set up the system pursuant to paragraph 1, the Court of Justice of the European Communities shall maintain the system for the exchange of information established by Protocol 2 of the 1988 Lugano Convention for judgments delivered under this Convention and the 1988 Lugano Convention.\nArticle 4\n1.   A Standing Committee shall be set up, composed of the representatives of the Contracting Parties.\n2.   At the request of a Contracting Party, the Depositary of the Convention shall convene meetings of the Committee for the purpose of:\n—\na consultation on the relationship between this Convention and other international instruments,\n—\na consultation on the application of Article 67, including intended accessions to instruments on particular matters according to Article 67(1), and proposed legislation according to Protocol 3,\n—\nthe consideration of the accession of new States. In particular, the Committee may ask acceding States referred to in Article 70(1)(c) questions about their judicial systems and the implementation of the Convention. The Committee may also consider possible adaptations to the Convention necessary for its application in the acceding States,\n—\nthe acceptance of new authentic language versions pursuant to Article 73(3) of this Convention and the necessary amendments to Annex VIII,\n—\na consultation on a revision of the Convention pursuant to Article 76,\n—\na consultation on amendments to Annexes I through IV and Annex VII pursuant to Article 77(1),\n—\nthe adoption of amendments to Annexes V and VI pursuant to Article 77(2),\n—\na withdrawal of the reservations and declarations made by the Contracting Parties pursuant to Protocol 1 and necessary amendments to Annex IX.\n3.   The Committee shall establish the procedural rules concerning its functioning and decision-making. These rules shall provide for the possibility to consult and decide by written procedure.\nArticle 5\n1.   The Depositary may convene, whenever necessary, a meeting of experts to exchange views on the functioning of the Convention, in particular on the development of the case-law and new legislation that may influence the application of the Convention.\n2.

the Lugano Convention\nSUMMARY OF:\nConvention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters\nCouncil Decision 2009/430/EC — conclusion of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE CONVENTION AND THE DECISION?\n              \nThe Convention aims to achieve the same level of circulation of judgments between the EU countries and Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. Known as the new Lugano Convention, it replaces the Lugano Convention of 1988.\nThe decision concludes the convention on behalf of the European Community (now the EU). It also establishes the declarations to be made at the time of depositing the instrument of ratification (annexed to the decision).\nKEY POINTS\nApplication\nThe convention applies to jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.\nIt does not apply to:\ntax, customs and administrative matters;\nthe status and legal capacity of natural persons;\nrights in property arising from matrimonial relationships;\nwills and succession;\nbankruptcy or composition;\nsocial security or arbitration.\nAchieving a high level of circulation of judgmentsThe convention, signed by the European Community, along with Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, was to come into force once it is ratified by the signatories. Denmark was a separate contracting party to this convention, because it had opted out of the then Brussels I regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001) — subsequently replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on court jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.\nThe contracting parties deposit their instruments of ratification with the Swiss Federal Council, which serves as depositary of the convention. On coming into force, the convention is open to:\nfuture members of the European Free Trade Association;\nEU countries acting on behalf of certain non-European territories that are part of their territory (for example French overseas territories such as Nouméa) or for whose external relations they are responsible;\nany other state, subject to the unanimous agreement of all the contracting parties.\nBased on the rules applicable between EU countries\nThe convention follows the present rules of the EU on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between EU countries. This means that the rules are similar in the EU and in Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. The convention also facilitates the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments handed down by the national courts of these countries.\nThe convention requires that, in general, persons domiciled (legally resident) in a state bound by the convention are sued in that state, whatever their nationality. However, it also provides for special rules of jurisdiction in certain matters, such as:\ncontracts: the courts of the country where the obligation is enforced have jurisdiction;\nmaintenance: jurisdiction resides with the courts of the place where the maintenance creditor (the person entitled to the payments for which the judgment provides) is domiciled or habitually resident;\ntort (a wrongful act or an infringement of a right giving rise to injury or harm), delict (a wrongful act for which the person injured has the right to a civil remedy) or quasi-delict (a negligent act or omission which causes harm or damage to the person or property of another, and thus exposes a person to civil liability in civil law jurisdictions): jurisdiction resides with the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur.\nThe convention also provides for specific jurisdictions in matters relating to:\ninsurance;\nconsumer contracts; and\nindividual contracts of employment.\nJurisdiction in matters relating to tenancies (possession of land or property as a tenant) and real property rights resides exclusively with the courts of the contracting state in which the property is situated.A number of protocols are annexed to the convention, among other things to ensure that the convention is interpreted as uniformly as possible.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE CONVENTION APPLY?\n              \nThe decision has applied since 27 November 2009. The convention entered into force between the EU and Norway on 1 January 2010, between the EU and Switzerland on 1 January 2011 and between the EU and Iceland on 1 May 2011, in accordance with Article 69(5) of the convention.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe signing of the convention marked a major institutional development. In its Opinion 1/03, the Court of Justice confirmed that the European Community was exclusively competent to conclude the new Lugano Convention. Signed on 30 October 2007, the convention is a key part of EU law and runs for an unlimited period.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nConvention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (OJ L 147, 10.6.2009, pp. 5-43)\nSuccessive amendments to the agreement have been incorporated in the original text.
