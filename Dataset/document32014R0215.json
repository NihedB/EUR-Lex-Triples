To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time to facilitate strategic programming of the ESI Funds, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by all Union residents, it is desirable to include these elements relevant for the programming of the ESI Funds to be set out by implementing acts as required by Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 in a single Regulation.\n(3)\nPursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, it is necessary to adopt a common methodology to determine the level of support for climate change objectives for each of the five ESI Funds. That methodology should consist of assigning a specific weighting to the support provided under the ESI Funds at a level which reflects the extent to which such support makes a contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. The specific weighting assigned should be differentiated on the basis of whether the support makes a significant or a moderate contribution towards climate change objectives. Where the support does not contribute towards those objectives or the contribution is insignificant, a weighting of zero should be assigned. The standard weightings should be used to ensure a harmonised approach to tracking of climate change related expenditure across different Union policies. The methodology should nevertheless reflect the differences in the interventions of each of the different ESI Funds. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, in the case of the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund weightings should be attached to categories of intervention established within the nomenclature adopted by the Commission. In the case of the EAFRD weightings should be attached to focus areas set out in Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) and in the case of the EMFF to measures set out in a future Union legal act establishing the condition for the financial support for maritime and fisheries policy for the 2014-2020 programming period.\n(4)\nPursuant to the fifth subparagraph of Article 22(7) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 it is also necessary to lay down detailed arrangements for determining the milestones and targets in the performance framework for each priority included in programmes supported by the ESI Funds and for assessing the achievement of those milestones and targets.\n(5)\nThe verification of whether the milestones and targets fulfil the conditions set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 requires recording of the information used for this purpose and of the methodological approach taken to establish the performance framework. While the inclusion of that information in programmes should be voluntary, such documentation should be available both to the Member State and to the Commission to inform the development of a performance framework which is consistent with Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n(6)\nAchievement of milestones set in the performance framework is a precondition for the definitive allocation of the performance reserve and serious failure to achieve milestones may lead to suspension of interim payments. It is therefore important to set out detailed arrangements for setting milestones and to define precisely what constitutes achievement of milestones.\n(7)\nSince achievement of targets set for the end of the programming period is an important measure of success delivering ESI Funds and serious failure to achieve targets may be the basis for a financial correction, it is important to state clearly the arrangements for setting targets and to clarify precisely what constitutes achieving targets or a serious failure to do so.\n(8)\nIn order to reflect the progress in implementation of operations under a priority, it is necessary to set out the characteristics of key implementation steps.\n(9)\nIn order to ensure that the performance framework reflects adequately the objectives and results sought for each Fund, or the Youth Employment Initiative, and category of region, where appropriate, it is necessary to set out specific provisions on the structure of the performance framework and on the assessment of the achievement of milestones and targets, where a priority covers more than one Fund or category of region. As only the ESF and the ERDF provide for financial allocations by category of region, the latter should not be considered relevant for the purposes of setting up a performance framework for the Cohesion Fund, the EAFRD and the EMFF.\n(10)\nPursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 96(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 it is necessary to specify common categories of intervention for the ERDF, the ESF and Cohesion Fund to enable Member States to submit to the Commission consistent information on the programmed use of the these Funds as well as information on the cumulative allocation and expenditure of these Funds by category and the number of operations throughout the application period of a programme. This is to enable the Commission to inform the other Union institutions and citizens of the Union in an appropriate manner about the use of the Funds. With the exception of categories of intervention which correspond directly to thematic objectives or investment priorities set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and in Fund-specific Regulations, the categories of intervention can be applied to support under different thematic objectives.\n(11)\nIn order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(12)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 150(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, given that the Coordination Committee for the European Structural and Investment Funds established by Article 150(1) of that Regulation delivered an opinion,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nMETHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE SUPPORT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE OBJECTIVES FOR EACH OF THE ESI FUNDS\n(Empowerment under the third subparagraph of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013)\nArticle 1\nMethodology for the calculation of support by the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund for climate change objectives\n1.   The calculation of support to be used for climate change objectives by the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund shall be carried out in two steps as follows:\n(a)\nthe coefficients set out in Table 1 of Annex I to this Regulation shall be applied by intervention field code to financial data reported for those codes;\n(b)\nin relation to financial data reported against intervention field codes that have a coefficient of zero, where financial data is reported in the thematic objective dimension against codes 04 and 05 set out in Table 5 of Annex I to this Regulation, the data shall be weighted with a 40 % coefficient in terms of their contribution to climate change objectives.\n2.   The climate change coefficients applied on the basis of Table 1 of Annex I to this Regulation shall also apply to the respective categories under the European territorial cooperation goal established on the basis of the second subparagraph of Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).\n3.   The calculation of support for climate change objectives by the ESF shall be made by identifying the financial data reported against dimension code 01 ‘Supporting the shift to a low carbon, resource efficient economy’ in accordance with Dimension 6 ‘Codes for the secondary theme dimension under the European Social Fund’ as set out in Table 6 of Annex I to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nMethodology for the calculation of support by the EAFRD for climate change objectives\n1.   The indicative amount of support to be used for climate change objectives by the EAFRD in each programme as referred to in Article 27(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be calculated by applying the coefficients set out in Annex II to this Regulation to the planned expenditure shown in the financing plan referred to in Article 8(1)(h) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 in relation to the priorities and focus areas referred to in points 3(b), 4, 5 and 6(b) of Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.\n2.   For the purpose of reporting on support used for climate change objectives in the annual implementation report in accordance with Article 50(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the coefficients referred to in paragraph 1 shall be applied to the information on expenditure referred to in Article 75(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.\nArticle 3\nMethodology for the calculation of support by the EMFF for climate change objectives\n1.   The contribution to climate change by the EMFF shall be calculated by attaching coefficients to each of the main measures supported by the EMFF reflecting the climate change relevance of each of these measures.\nSupport by the EMFF for climate change objectives shall be calculated on the basis of the following information:\n(a)\nthe indicative amount of support to be used for climate change objectives by the EMFF in each programme as referred to in Article 27(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013;\n(b)\nthe coefficients established for the main measures supported by the EMFF as set out in Annex III to this Regulation;\n(c)\nreporting by Member States on financial appropriations and expenditure by measure in annual implementation reports pursuant to Article 50(4) and (5) of Regulation No 1303/2013;\n(d)\nthe information and data provided by Member States on operations selected for funding pursuant to a future Union legal act establishing the conditions for the financial support for maritime and fisheries policy for the programming period 2014-2020 (the ‘EMFF Regulation’).\n2.   A Member State may propose in its operational programme that a coefficient of 40 % be assigned to a measure weighed with a coefficient of 0 % in Annex III to this Regulation, provided that it can demonstrate the relevance of that measure to climate change mitigation or adaptation.\nCHAPTER II\nDETERMINING MILESTONES AND TARGETS IN THE PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK AND ASSESSING THEIR ACHIEVEMENT\n(Empowerment under the fifth subparagraph of Article 22(7) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013)\nArticle 4\nInformation to be recorded by the bodies preparing the programmes\n1.   The bodies preparing programmes shall record information on the methodologies and criteria applied to select indicators for the performance framework to ensure that corresponding milestones and targets comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 for all programmes and priorities supported by the ESI Funds, as well as the specific allocation to the Youth Employment Initiative (‘YEI’) as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), subject to the exceptions set out in paragraph 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n2.   The information recorded by the bodies preparing programmes shall permit verification of compliance with the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 for the milestones and targets. This shall include:\n(a)\ndata or evidence used to estimate the value of milestones and targets and the calculation method, such as data on unit costs, benchmarks, standard or a past rate of implementation, expert advice and the conclusions of the ex-ante evaluation;\n(b)\ninformation on the share of the financial allocation represented by operations, to which the output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework correspond, as well as the explanation of how that share has been calculated;\n(c)\ninformation on how the methodology and mechanisms to ensure consistency in the functioning of the performance framework set out in the Partnership Agreement in accordance with Article 15(1)(b)(iv) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 have been applied;\n(d)\nan explanation of the selection of result indicators or key implementation steps, where these have been included in the performance framework.\n3.   The information on the methodologies and criteria applied to select indicators for the performance framework and to fix corresponding milestones and targets recorded by the bodies preparing programmes shall be made available at the request of the Commission.\n4.   The requirements referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 of this Article shall also apply to the revision of milestones and targets in accordance with Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nArticle 5\nEstablishment of milestones and targets\n1.   Milestones and targets shall be set at the level of the priority, except in the cases referred to in Article 7. Output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework shall correspond to more than 50 % of the financial allocation to the priority. For the purposes of establishing that amount, an allocation to an indicator or key implementation step shall not be counted more than once.\n2.   For all ESI Funds, except for the EAFRD, the milestone and the target for a financial indicator shall refer to the total amount of eligible expenditure entered into the accounting system of the certifying authority and certified by that authority in accordance with point (c) of Article 126 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nFor the EAFRD, they shall refer to the realised total public expenditure entered into the common monitoring and evaluation system.\n3.   For all ESI Funds, except for the ESF and the EAFRD, the milestone and target for an output indicator shall refer to operations, where all the actions leading to outputs have been implemented in full, but for which not all the payments have necessarily been made.\nFor the ESF and for the EAFRD for measures according to Articles 16, 19(1)(c), 21 (1)(a) and (b), 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, they may also relate to the achieved value for operations which have been started but where some of the actions leading to outputs are still ongoing.\nFor other measures under the EAFRD, they shall refer to the completed operations in the meaning of Article 2(14) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n4.   A key implementation step shall be an important stage in the implementation of operations under a priority, whose completion is verifiable and may be expressed by a number or percentage. For the purpose of Articles 6 and 7 of this Regulation, key implementation steps shall be treated as indicators.\n5.   A result indicator shall be used only where appropriate and closely linked to supported policy interventions.\n6.   Where the information referred to in Article 4(2) of this Regulation has been found to be based on incorrect assumptions leading to under- or over-estimation of targets or milestones, this may be considered to constitute a duly justified case in the meaning of paragraph 5 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nArticle 6\nAchievement of milestones and targets\n1.   The achievement of milestones and targets shall be assessed by taking into account all indicators and key implementation steps included in the performance framework set at the level of priority in the meaning of Article 2(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 except in cases referred to in Article 7 of this Regulation.\n2.   The milestones or targets of a priority shall be deemed to be achieved if all indicators included in the related performance framework have achieved at least 85 % of the milestone value by the end of 2018 or at least 85 % of the target value by the end of 2023. By way of derogation, where the performance framework includes three or more indicators, the milestones or targets of a priority may be deemed to be achieved if all indicators except for one achieve 85 % of their milestone values by the end of 2018 or 85 % of their target value by the end of 2023. The indicator, which does not achieve 85 % of its milestone or target value, shall not achieve less than 75 % of its milestone or target value.\n3.   For a priority whose performance framework includes no more than two indicators, a failure to achieve at least 65 % of the milestone value by the end of 2018 for either of these indicators shall be deemed a serious failure to achieve milestones. A failure to achieve at least 65 % of the target value by the end of 2023 for either of these indicators shall be deemed a serious failure to achieve the targets.\n4.   For a priority whose performance framework includes more than two indicators the failure to achieve at least 65 % of the milestone value by the end of 2018 for at least two of those indicators shall be deemed a serious failure to achieve milestones A failure to achieve at least 65 % of the target value by the end of 2023 for at least two of these indicators shall be deemed a serious failure to achieve the targets.\nArticle 7\nPerformance framework for priority axes referred to in Article 96(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and priority axes integrating the YEI\n1.   The indicators and key implementation steps selected for the performance framework, their milestones and targets, as well as their achievement values shall be broken down by Fund and, for the ERDF and the ESF, by category of region.\n2.   The information required in Article 4(2) of this Regulation shall be set out by Fund and by category of region, where applicable.\n3.   The achievement of milestones and targets shall be assessed separately for each Fund and for each category of region within the priority, taking into account the indicators, their milestones and targets, and their achievement values broken down by Fund and category of region. Output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework shall correspond to more than 50 % of the financial allocation to the Fund and category of region, where applicable. For the purposes of establishing that amount, an allocation to an indicator or key implementation step shall not be counted more than once.\n4.   If the resources for the YEI are programmed as a part of a priority axis in accordance with Article 18(c) of Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013, a performance framework shall be established separately for the YEI and the achievement of milestones set for the YEI shall be assessed separately from the other part of the priority axis.\nCHAPTER III\nNOMENCLATURE OF CATEGORIES OF INTERVENTION FOR THE ERDF, THE ESF AND THE COHESION FUND UNDER THE INVESTMENT FOR GROWTH AND JOBS GOAL\nArticle 8\nCategories of intervention for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund\n(Empowerment under the second subparagraph of Article 96(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013)\n1.

Where the contribution is insignificant, a weighting of zero is given. These weightings are used to harmonise the tracking of the support contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation goals across different EU policies, and reflect the differences in the contributions from each of the ESI funds.\nCalculations of financial support for climate change objectives for the various ESI funds are prioritised using weightings, as in the following examples.\nERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund\nProductive investment: investment in large enterprises linked to the low-carbon economy is weighted at 40%.\nInfrastructure providing basic services: renewable energy and energy efficiency measures are weighted at 100%;railways, clean urban transport and seaports are weighted at 40%;development of roads and airports is weighted at 0%.\nDevelopment of existing potential: energy efficiency and low carbon economy projects, including the development of cycle tracks and footpaths, are rated at 100%.\nEAFRD\nRestoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems, promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors are given 100% weightings when calculating ESIF support.\nProjects aimed at farm risk prevention and management, and fostering local development in rural areas are given 40% weightings.\nEMFF\n100% weightings are given to projects with the following goals:\nclimate change mitigation;on-board investments;energy efficiency audits and schemes;\nengine replacement or modernisation;\npermanently ceasing fishing activities.\nProjects which are given a 40% weighting:\ntemporarily ceasing fishing activities;\nmutual funds for adverse climatic events and environmental incidents;\nfishing opportunities allocation systems;\nadapting fishing to the protection of species;\nprotecting and restoring marine biodiversity;\nalternative propulsion and hull design;\nprotecting and developing inland aquatic fauna and flora;\nincreasing aquaculture potential;\npromoting the protection of marine environment, and the sustainable use of marine and coastal resources;\ninvestments improving fishing ports and auction halls infrastructure or landing sites and shelters.\nMilestones and targets\nThe milestones or targets of a priority shall be deemed to be achieved if the related indicators have reached:\nat least 85% of the milestone value by the end of 2018; or\nat least 85% of the target value by the end of 2023.\nFROM WHEN DOES THIS IMPLEMENTING REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 9 March 2014.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information see:\nClimate action (European Commission)\nEuropean structural and investment funds (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 215/2014 of 7 March 2014 laying down rules for implementing Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund with regard to methodologies for climate change support, the determination of milestones and targets in the performance framework and the nomenclature of categories of intervention for the European Structural and Investment Funds (OJ L 69, 8.3.2014, pp. 65-84)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 215/2014 have been incorporated in the original text.
