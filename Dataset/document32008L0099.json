Such offences pose a threat to the environment and therefore call for an appropriate response.\n(3)\nExperience has shown that the existing systems of penalties have not been sufficient to achieve complete compliance with the laws for the protection of the environment. Such compliance can and should be strengthened by the availability of criminal penalties, which demonstrate a social disapproval of a qualitatively different nature compared to administrative penalties or a compensation mechanism under civil law.\n(4)\nCommon rules on criminal offences make it possible to use effective methods of investigation and assistance within and between Member States.\n(5)\nIn order to achieve effective protection of the environment, there is a particular need for more dissuasive penalties for environmentally harmful activities, which typically cause or are likely to cause substantial damage to the air, including the stratosphere, to soil, water, animals or plants, including to the conservation of species.\n(6)\nFailure to comply with a legal duty to act can have the same effect as active behaviour and should therefore also be subject to corresponding penalties.\n(7)\nTherefore, such conduct should be considered a criminal offence throughout the Community when committed intentionally or with serious negligence.\n(8)\nThe legislation listed in the Annexes to this Directive contains provisions which should be subject to criminal law measures in order to ensure that the rules on environmental protection are fully effective.\n(9)\nThe obligations under this Directive only relate to the provisions of the legislation listed in the Annexes to this Directive which entail an obligation for Member States, when implementing that legislation, to provide for prohibitive measures.\n(10)\nThis Directive obliges Member States to provide for criminal penalties in their national legislation in respect of serious infringements of provisions of Community law on the protection of the environment. This Directive creates no obligations regarding the application of such penalties, or any other available system of law enforcement, in individual cases.\n(11)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to other systems of liability for environmental damage under Community law or national law.\n(12)\nAs this Directive provides for minimum rules, Member States are free to adopt or maintain more stringent measures regarding the effective criminal law protection of the environment. Such measures must be compatible with the Treaty.\n(13)\nMember States should provide information to the Commission on the implementation of this Directive, in order to enable it to evaluate the effect of this Directive.\n(14)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure a more effective protection of the environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Directive, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(15)\nWhenever subsequent legislation on environmental matters is adopted, it should specify where appropriate that this Directive will apply. Where necessary, Article 3 should be amended.\n(16)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles as recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive establishes measures relating to criminal law in order to protect the environment more effectively.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Directive:\n(a)\n‘unlawful’ means infringing:\n(i)\nthe legislation adopted pursuant to the EC Treaty and listed in Annex A;

means of criminal law\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt defines a number of serious offences that harm the environment.\nIt requires EU Member States to introduce effective and proportionate penalties constituting a deterrent for such offences, regardless of whether they are committed intentionally or through serious negligence.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nTypes of unlawful* behaviour harmful to human health or the environment that are subject to penalties include:\ndischarging, emitting or otherwise releasing dangerous materials into the air, soil or water;\ncollecting, transporting, recovering or disposing of hazardous waste;\nshipping noticeable quantities of waste;\noperating an industrial plant that conducts dangerous activities or stores dangerous substances (e.g. factories producing paints or chemicals);\nmanufacturing, treating, storing, using, transporting, importing, exporting or disposing of nuclear material and hazardous radioactive materials;\nkilling, possessing or trafficking in noticeable amounts of protected animal and plant species;\ndamaging protected habitats;\nproducing, trading in or using substances that deplete the ozone layer (e.g. chemicals in fire extinguishers or cleaning solvents).\nPenalties\nMember States must ensure that the offences or types of unlawful behaviour listed in Article 3 of the directive are punishable by effective and proportionate criminal penalties constituting a deterrent and applicable to individuals.\nMember States must establish that legal persons* can be held liable for offences committed for their benefit by individuals acting in a leading position based on a power of representation, on an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person or to exercise control within the legal person. Legal persons are also held liable if the lack of supervision or control by such an individual in a leading position has made it possible to commit the offence.\nLiability of legal persons does not exclude criminal proceedings against individuals who are perpetrators, inciters or accessories in the offence referred to in the directive.\nDepending on the legal system applicable in the Member State concerned, the liability of legal persons may be criminal or non-criminal.\nThis directive builds upon Directive 2004/35/EC (see summary), which lays down rules on environmental liability as regards preventing and remedying environmental damage.\nMember States are responsible for prosecuting environmental crime. Because legal systems differ among Member States, criminals can exploit any lack of cooperation and coordination between national authorities. Networks of environmental professionals, such as the EU Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law, the EU Forum of Judges for the Environment and the European Network of Prosecutors for the Environment, play an important role in sharing best practices and developing methodologies for effective enforcement.\nReview\nThe directive is currently being revised.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 26 December 2008 and had to become law in the Member States by 26 December 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nCombating environmental crime (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nUnlawful. In this context, refers to breach of EU or national laws that give effect to the EU legislation referred to in the Annexes to Directive 2008/99/EC.\nLegal person. A non-human entity, such as a company, that is treated as a person for limited legal purposes. A legal person can sue, be sued, own property and enter into contracts.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2008/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on the protection of the environment through criminal law (OJ L 328, 6.12.2008, pp. 28–37).\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nDirective 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (OJ L 143, 30.4.2004, pp. 56–75).\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2004/35/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
