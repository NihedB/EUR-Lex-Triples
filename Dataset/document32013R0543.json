Deeper market integration and the rapid development of intermittent renewable energy generation sources such as wind and solar require the disclosure of complete, timely available, high quality and easily digestible information relating to supply and demand fundamentals.\n(4)\nThe timely availability of complete sets of data on fundamentals should also increase the security of energy supplies. It should allow market parties to precisely match supply and demand reducing the risk for black-outs. As a result TSOs should be able to better control their networks and operate them under more predictable and secure conditions.\n(5)\nCurrent transparency measures do not fully satisfy these criteria. In addition, relevant market information is unevenly distributed among market participants with large incumbent players having exclusive access to information in relation to their own assets putting new market participants or participants without own assets at a disadvantage.\n(6)\nMarket participants should be provided with timely information on the expected consumption. This information should be regularly updated and be provided for different timeframes. The actual outturn of the expected consumption should also be made available shortly after real time.\n(7)\nThe planned and unplanned unavailability of power generation and consumption units is one of the most important supply-demand relevant information for market participants. Market participants and TSOs need to be provided with detailed information on where, when and why units are not or will not be available to generate or consume and when they are expected to return in operation. This should also help TSOs to better reallocate reserves reducing the probability for black-outs.\n(8)\nMarket participants and TSOs should also receive detailed information about the overall installed generation capacity, estimations about total scheduled generation, including separately for intermittent generation, and unit level data about actual generation of larger production facilities.\n(9)\nIn order to be able to move power from where it is available to where it is most needed and adjust portfolios accordingly, the market should be provided with information about planned and unplanned unavailability of existing cross-border transmission infrastructure and plans about infrastructure developments. TSOs should also provide and regularly update data on planned and offered cross-border transfer capacities for different time horizons as well as information related to the allocation and use of capacities.\n(10)\nThrough the rapid deployment of intermittent generation sources away from consumption centres, transmission infrastructure has increasingly got congested in large parts of Europe. To relieve congestions TSOs have increasingly intervened in market operations instructing market participants to change their generation or trading commitments. In order to enable the market to understand where and why congestion management measures have become necessary, TSOs need to provide timely, detailed and reasoned information about their actions.\n(11)\nEven after careful planning producers, suppliers and traders may find themselves out of balance and be exposed to TSOs balancing and settlement regime. In order to optimally mitigate imbalance risk market participants need accurate, clear and timely information about balancing markets. TSOs should provide such information in a comparable format across borders including details about the reserves they have contracted, prices paid and volumes activated for balancing purposes.\n(12)\nTSOs are often the primary source of relevant fundamental information. They are also used to collect and assess large amounts of information for system operation purposes. In order to provide an overall view of relevant information across the Union, TSOs should facilitate the collection, verification and processing of data and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (the ENTSO for Electricity) should make the data available to the public through a central information transparency platform. In order to make best use of existing sources of transparency, the ENTSO for Electricity should be able to receive information for publication through third parties such as power exchanges and transparency platforms.\n(13)\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(14)\nThis Regulation has been adopted on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 which it supplements and of which it forms an integral part. References to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 in other legal acts shall be understood as also referring to this Regulation.\n(15)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the minimum common set of data relating to generation, transportation and consumption of electricity to be made available to market participants.
