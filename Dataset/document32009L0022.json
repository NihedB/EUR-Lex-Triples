{"celex_id": "32009L0022", "reference": "1.5.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 110/30\nDIRECTIVE 2009/22/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 April 2009\non injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests\n(Codified version)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 98/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 1998 on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2)\nCertain Directives, listed in Annex I to this Directive, lay down rules with regard to the protection of consumers' interests.\n(3)\nCurrent mechanisms available for ensuring compliance with those Directives, both at national and at Community level, do not always allow infringements harmful to the collective interests of consumers to be terminated in good time. Collective interests means interests which do not include the cumulation of interests of individuals who have been harmed by an infringement. This is without prejudice to individual actions brought by individuals who have been harmed by an infringement.\n(4)\nAs far as the purpose of bringing about the cessation of practices that are unlawful under the national provisions applicable is concerned, the effectiveness of national measures transposing the Directives in question, including protective measures that go beyond the level required by those Directives, provided they are compatible with the Treaty and allowed by those Directives, may be thwarted where those practices produce effects in a Member State other than that in which they originate.\n(5)\nThose difficulties can disrupt the smooth functioning of the internal market, their consequence being that it is sufficient to move the source of an unlawful practice to another country in order to place it out of reach of all forms of enforcement. This constitutes a distortion of competition.\n(6)\nThose difficulties are likely to diminish consumer confidence in the internal market and may limit the scope for action by organisations representing the collective interests of consumers or independent public bodies responsible for protecting the collective interests of consumers, adversely affected by practices that infringe Community law.\n(7)\nThose practices often extend beyond the frontiers between the Member States. There is an urgent need for some degree of approximation of national provisions designed to enjoin the cessation of the unlawful practices irrespective of the Member State in which the unlawful practice has produced its effects. With regard to jurisdiction, this is without prejudice to the rules of private international law and the Conventions in force between Member States, while respecting the general obligations of the Member States deriving from the Treaty, in particular those related to the smooth functioning of the internal market.\n(8)\nThe objective of the action envisaged can only be attained by the Community. It is therefore incumbent on the Community to act.\n(9)\nThe third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty makes it incumbent on the Community not to go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty. In accordance with that Article, the specific features of national legal systems must be taken into account to every extent possible by leaving Member States free to choose between different options having equivalent effect. The courts or administrative authorities competent to rule on the proceedings referred to in this Directive should have the right to examine the effects of previous decisions.\n(10)\nOne option should consist in requiring one or more independent public bodies, specifically responsible for the protection of the collective interests of consumers, to exercise the rights of action set out in this Directive. Another option should provide for the exercise of those rights by organisations whose purpose is to protect the collective interests of consumers, in accordance with criteria laid down by national law.\n(11)\nMember States should be able to choose between or combine these two options in designating at national level the bodies and/or organisations qualified for the purposes of this Directive.\n(12)\nFor the purposes of intra-Community infringements the principle of mutual recognition should apply to these bodies and/or organisations. The Member States should, at the request of their national entities, communicate to the Commission the name and purpose of their national entities which are qualified to bring an action in their own country according to the provisions of this Directive.\n(13)\nIt is the business of the Commission to ensure the publication of a list of these qualified entities in the Official Journal of the European Union. Until a statement to the contrary is published, a qualified entity is assumed to have legal capacity if its name is included in that list.\n(14)\nMember States should be able to require that a prior consultation be undertaken by the party that intends to bring an action for an injunction, in order to give the defendant an opportunity to bring the contested infringement to an end. Member States should be able to require that this prior consultation take place jointly with an independent public body designated by those Member States.\n(15)\nWhere the Member States have established that there should be prior consultation, a deadline of two weeks after the request for consultation is received should be set after which, should the cessation of the infringement not be achieved, the applicant shall be entitled to bring an action, without any further delay, before the competent court or administrative authority.\n(16)\nIt is appropriate that the Commission report on the functioning of this Directive and in particular on its scope and on the operation of prior consultation.\n(17)\nThe application of this Directive should not prejudice the application of Community competition rules.\n(18)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits for transposition and application in national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.   The purpose of this Directive is to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to actions for an injunction referred to in Article 2 aimed at the protection of the collective interests of consumers included in the Directives listed in Annex I, with a view to ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market.\n2.   For the purposes of this Directive, an infringement means any act contrary to the Directives listed in Annex I as transposed into the internal legal order of the Member States which harms the collective interests referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 2\nActions for an injunction\n1.   Member States shall designate the courts or administrative authorities competent to rule on proceedings commenced by qualified entities within the meaning of Article 3 seeking:\n(a)\nan order with all due expediency, where appropriate by way of summary procedure, requiring the cessation or prohibition of any infringement;\n(b)\nwhere appropriate, measures such as the publication of the decision, in full or in part, in such form as deemed adequate and/or the publication of a corrective statement with a view to eliminating the continuing effects of the infringement;\n(c)\nin so far as the legal system of the Member State concerned so permits, an order against the losing defendant for payments into the public purse or to any beneficiary designated in or under national legislation, in the event of failure to comply with the decision within a time limit specified by the courts or administrative authorities, of a fixed amount for each day’s delay or any other amount provided for in national legislation, with a view to ensuring compliance with the decisions.\n2.   This Directive shall be without prejudice to the rules of private international law with respect to the applicable law, that is, normally, either the law of the Member State where the infringement originated or the law of the Member State where the infringement has its effects.\nArticle 3\nEntities qualified to bring an action\nFor the purposes of this Directive, a ‘qualified entity’ means any body or organisation which, being properly constituted according to the law of a Member State, has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the provisions referred to in Article 1 are complied with, in particular:\n(a)\none or more independent public bodies, specifically responsible for protecting the interests referred to in Article 1, in Member States in which such bodies exist; and/or\n(b)\norganisations whose purpose is to protect the interests referred to in Article 1, in accordance with the criteria laid down by the national law.\nArticle 4\nIntra-Community infringements\n1.   Each Member State shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, in the event of an infringement originating in that Member State, any qualified entity from another Member State where the interests protected by that qualified entity are affected by the infringement, may apply to the court or administrative authority referred to in Article 2, on presentation of the list provided for in paragraph 3 of this Article. The courts or administrative authorities shall accept this list as proof of the legal capacity of the qualified entity without prejudice to their right to examine whether the purpose of the qualified entity justifies its taking action in a specific case.\n2.   For the purposes of intra-Community infringements, and without prejudice to the rights granted to other entities under national legislation, the Member States shall, at the request of their qualified entities, communicate to the Commission that these entities are qualified to bring an action under Article 2. The Member States shall inform the Commission of the name and purpose of these qualified entities.\n3.   The Commission shall draw up a list of the qualified entities referred to in paragraph 2, with the specification of their purpose. This list shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union; changes to this list shall be published without delay and the updated list shall be published every six months.\nArticle 5\nPrior consultation\n1.   Member States may introduce or maintain in force provisions whereby the party that intends to seek an injunction can only start this procedure after it has tried to achieve the cessation of the infringement in consultation either with the defendant or with both the defendant and a qualified entity within the meaning of Article 3(a) of the Member State in which the injunction is sought. It shall be for the Member State to decide whether the party seeking the injunction must consult the qualified entity. If the cessation of the infringement is not achieved within two weeks after the request for consultation is received, the party concerned may bring an action for an injunction without any further delay.\n2.   The rules governing prior consultation adopted by Member States shall be notified to the Commission and shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 6\nReports\n1.   Every three years and for the first time no later than 2 July 2003 the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the application of this Directive.\n2.   In its first report the Commission shall examine in particular:\n(a)\nthe scope of this Directive in relation to the protection of the collective interests of persons exercising a commercial, industrial, craft or professional activity;\n(b)\nthe scope of this Directive as determined by the Directives listed in Annex I;\n(c)\nwhether the prior consultation provided for in Article 5 has contributed to the effective protection of consumers.\nWhere appropriate, this report shall be accompanied by proposals with a view to amending this Directive.\nArticle 7\nProvisions for wider action\nThis Directive shall not prevent Member States from adopting or maintaining in force provisions designed to grant qualified entities and any other person concerned more extensive rights to bring action at national level.\nArticle 8\nImplementation\nMember States shall communicate to the Commission the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\nArticle 9\nRepeal\nDirective 98/27/EC, as amended by the Directives set out in Annex II, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.\nArticle 10\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on 29 December 2009.\nArticle 11\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 23 April 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

protecting the collective interests of consumers (until 2023)\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2009/22/EC – injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt introduces European Union (EU) rules to ensure that injunctions are effective enough to terminate infringements that are harmful to the collective interests of consumers.\nThe directive will be repealed and replaced by Directive (EU) 2020/1828 (see summary) as of 25 June 2023.\nKEY POINTS\nInjunctions aim to terminate or prohibit infringements that are contrary to the collective interests of consumers. The alignment of legislation in accordance with this directive allows these injunctions to be more effective and enables the EU’s internal market to function more smoothly.\nThe infringements concerned include those relating to consumer credit, package travel, unfair terms in contracts concluded with consumers, distance contracts and unfair commercial practices. A full list of the directives concerned can be found in Annex I to Directive 2009/22/EC.\nRecourse to injunctions may result in: the cessation or prohibition of an infringement, where appropriate by way of summary procedure*;the elimination of the continuing effects of an infringement, particularly through the publication of the decision;the sentencing of defendants to comply with a decision by requiring them to pay a fine.\nBodies qualified to bring an action must have a legitimate interest in ensuring that the collective interests of consumers and the smooth running of the internal market are complied with. This is the case, in particular, for independent public bodies specifically responsible for protecting the collective interests of consumers, or for consumer protection organisations.\nA list of the qualified authorities that may bring action in the event of infringements within the EU is established by the European Commission and published in the Official Journal of the European Union. For the list of qualified bodies that are able to act in the case of infringements within the EU, please see here.\nThe EU Member State in which an action is to be brought may decide whether there should be prior consultation between the parties, in the presence or not of a qualified body from that country. If the infringement continues for more than 2 weeks after the request for consultation has been received, the action for an injunction may be brought immediately.\nA study on the application of Directive 2009/22/EC was undertaken in 2011 and was used in the preparation of a Commission report published in 2012.\nThe directive was evaluated in 2017 within the fitness check of EU consumer and marketing law.\nRepeal\nDirective 2009/22/EC will be repealed and replaced by Directive (EU) 2020/1828 as of 25 June 2023. The latter was adopted following the Commission’s ‘new deal for consumers’ initiative.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 29 December 2009. Directive 2009/22/EC codified and replaced Directive 98/27/EC and its subsequent amendments. The original Directive 98/27/EC had to become law in the Member States by 2001.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nInjunctions (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nSummary procedure. A special procedure enabling the arbitral tribunal to discard ineligible, abusive claims at the preliminary stage of an arbitration proceeding.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests (codified version) (OJ L 110, 1.5.2009, pp. 30–36).\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2009/22/EC have been incorporated in the original text.
