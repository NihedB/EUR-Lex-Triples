This Directive shall apply to checks carried out by Member States  on the transport of dangerous goods by road in vehicles travelling in their territory or entering  it from a third country. It shall not apply to the transport of dangerous goods by vehicles belonging to or under the  responsibility of the armed forces. 2.  This Directive shall not, however, affect the Member States' right, with due regard to  Community law, to carry out checks on the national and international transport of dangerous goods  within their territories performed by vehicles not covered by this Directive. Article 2 For the purposes of this Directive: -  'vehicle` shall mean any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, whether complete or  incomplete, which has at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, together  with its trailers, with the exception of vehicles which run on rails, of agricultural and forestry  tractors and of all mobile machinery, -  'dangerous goods` shall mean dangerous goods defined as such in Directive 94/55/EC, -  'transport` shall mean any road transport operation performed by a vehicle wholly or partly on  public roads within the territory of a Member State, including the loading and unloading of goods  covered by Directive 94/55/EC, without prejudice to the arrangements laid down by the laws of the  Member States concerning liability in respect of such operations, -  'undertaking` shall mean any natural or legal person, whether or not profit-seeking, any  association or group of persons without legal personality, whether or not profit-seeking, and any  body coming under a public authority, whether itself possessing legal personality or dependent on  an authority having such personality, which carry, load or unload dangerous goods or cause them to  be carried and those which temporarily store, collect, package or take delivery of such goods as  part of a transport operation and are located in the territory of the Community, -  'check` shall mean any check, control, inspection, verification or formality carried out by the  competent authorities for reasons of safety inherent in the transport of dangerous goods. Article 3 1.  The Member States shall ensure that a representative proportion of consignments of  dangerous goods transported by road is subject to the checks laid down by this Directive, in order  to check their compliance with the laws on the transport of dangerous goods by road. 2.  Such checks shall be carried out in the territory of a Member State in accordance with Article  3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4060/89 and Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3912/92. Article 4 1.  In order to carry out the checks provided for in this Directive, the Member States  shall use the checklist in Annex I. A copy of this checklist or a certificate showing the result of  the check drawn up by the authority which carried it out shall be given to the driver of the  vehicle and presented on request in order to simplify or avoid, where possible, subsequent checks.  This paragraph shall not prejudice Member States' right to carry out specific measures for detailed  checks. 2.  The checks shall be random and shall as far as possible cover an extensive portion of the road  network. 3.  The places chosen for these checks must permit infringing vehicles to be brought into  compliance or, if the authority carrying out the check deems it appropriate to be immobilized  on-the-spot or at a place desginated for that purpose by the said authority without causing a  safety hazard. 4.  Where appropriate and provided that this does not constitute a safety hazard, samples of the  goods transported may be taken for examination by laboratories recognized by the competent  authority. 5.  Checks shall not exceed a reasonable length of time. Article 5 Without prejudice to other penalties which may be imposed, vehicles in respect of which  one or more infringements of the rules on the transport of dangerous goods, in particular  infringements listed in Annex II, are established may be immobilized either on-the-spot or at a  place designated for this purpose by the authorities carrying out the check and required to be  brought into conformity before continuing their journey or may be subject to other appropriate  measures, depending on the circumstances or the requirements of safety including, where  appropriate, refusal to allow such vehicles to enter the Community. Article 6 1.  Checks may also be carried out at the premises of undertakings, as a preventive  measure or where infringements which jeopardize safety in the transport of dangerous goods have  been recorded at the roadside. 2.  The purpose of such checks shall be to ensure that safety conditions for the transport of  dangerous goods by road comply with the relevant laws. Where one or more infringements, in particular those listed in Annex II, have been established in  respect of the transport of dangerous goods by road, the transport in question shall be brought  into conformity before the goods leave the undertaking or shall be subject to other appropriate  measures. Article 7 1.  Member States shall assist one another in order to give proper effect to this  Directive. 2.  Serious or repeated infringements jeopardizing the safety of the transport of dangerous goods  committed by a non-resident vehicle or undertaking must be reported to the competent authorites in  the Member State in which the vehicle is registered or in which the undertaking is established. The competent authorities of the Member State in which serious or repeated infringements have been  recorded may ask the competent authorities of the Member State in which the vehicle is registered  or in which the undertaking is established for appropriate measures to be taken with regard to the  offender or offenders. The latter competent authorities shall notify the competent authorities of the Member State in  which the infringements were recorded of any measures taken with regard to the transporter or the  undertaking. Article 8 If the findings of a roadside check on a vehicle registered in another Member State  give grounds for believing that serious or repeated infringements have been committed which cannot  be detected in the course of that check in the absence of the necessary data, the competent  authorities of the Member States concerned shall assist one another in order to clarify the  situation. Where, to that end, the competent Member State carries out a check in the undertaking,  the other Member States concerned shall be notified of the results. Article 9 1.  Each Member State shall send the Commission for each calendar year not later than  twelve months after the end of that year a report, drawn up in accordance with the model in Annex  III, on the application of this Directive, including the following particulars: -  if possible, determined or estimated volume of dangerous goods transported by road (in tonnes  transported or in tonnes/kilometres), -  number of checks carried out, -  number of vehicles checked by place of registration (vehicles registered nationally, in other  Member States or in third countries), -  number and types of infringements recorded, -  type and number of penalties imposed. 2.  The Commission shall send the European Parliament and the Council, for the first time in 1999  and subsequently at least every three years, a report on the application of this Directive by the  Member States, stating the particulars in accordance with paragraph 1 above. Article 10 1.  Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative  provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 1997.

It does not apply to the transport of dangerous goods under the responsibility of the armed forces.\nThese checks are carried out in the territory of an EU country, provided that they are not carried out as frontier checks at the internal frontiers of the EU, but as part of normal checks without discrimination.\nThe directive has 3 annexes: Annex I — the checklist that needs to be completed during an inspection;Annex II — a list and categorisation of infringements (for example, Category I includes transport of goods not authorised for transport, absence of a consignor’s declaration on the conformity of the goods and their packaging with transport legislation, inappropriate vehicle or packaging, etc.);Annex III — model standard form for the report to be sent by the EU country to the European Commission concerning infringements and penalties recorded nationally.\nChecks must: cover at least the items included in the checklist in Annex I;be carried out at different places, at any time of the day; andcover a sufficiently extensive portion of the road network to make checkpoints difficult to avoid.\nEU countries’ authorities may immobilise consignments that do not comply. They may oblige them to be brought into conformity before continuing their journey or make them subject to other appropriate measures, depending on the circumstances or the safety requirements. This may include, where appropriate, refusal to allow such vehicles to enter the EU.\nChecks may also be carried out at business premises.\nEU countries must work together to implement this directive effectively (report infringements to the country in which the carrier is registered, share information, etc.).\nEach EU country must send the Commission a report for each calendar year on the application of the directive, including the particulars listed in the directive, such as: the estimated volume of dangerous goods transported by road (in tonnes transported or in tonnes/kilometres);the number of checks carried out and the number of vehicles checked by place of registration (vehicles registered nationally, in other EU countries, or in non-EU countries);the number and categories of infringements recorded;the type and number of penalties imposed.\nEvery 3 years, the Commission must send the European Parliament and the Council a report on the application of the directive by the EU countries.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 17 October 1995 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 1997.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nDangerous goods (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 95/50/EC of 6 October 1995 on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road (OJ L 249, 17.10.1995, pp. 35-40)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 95/50/EC have been incorporated in the original document.
