{"celex_id": "32013R0576", "reference": "28.6.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 178/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 576/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 12 June 2013\non the non-commercial movement of pet animals and repealing Regulation (EC) No 998/2003\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) and point (b) of Article 168(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) lays down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals into a Member State from another Member State or from third countries and the checks applicable to such movement. It aims to ensure a sufficient level of safety with regard to the public and animal health risks involved in such non-commercial movement and to remove any unjustified obstacles to such movement.\n(2)\nIn a statement annexed to Regulation (EU) No 438/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals (4), the Commission undertook to propose a revision of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 in its entirety, in particular the aspects of delegated and implementing acts. Therefore, due to the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 need to be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. Taking into account the number of amendments that need to be made to the animal health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 and in order to ensure that those requirements are sufficiently clear and accessible to the ordinary citizen, that Regulation should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(3)\nThis Regulation should establish a list of animal species to which harmonised animal health requirements should apply when animals of those species are kept as pet animals and are subject to non-commercial movement. When drawing up that list, account should be taken of their susceptibility to or role in the epidemiology of rabies.\n(4)\nCouncil Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (5) establishes, inter alia, the animal health requirements applicable to trade in and imports of dogs, cats and ferrets, which are animals of species susceptible to rabies. Since those species are also kept as pet animals that frequently accompany their owner or an authorised person during non-commercial movement within and into the Union, this Regulation should lay down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of those species into Member States. Those species should be listed in Part A of Annex I to this Regulation.\n(5)\nSimilarly, a legal framework should be established for the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of animals of species not affected by rabies or of no epidemiological significance as regards rabies, to which, if they were not kept as pet animals, other legal acts of the Union would apply, including legislation on food-producing animals. Those species should be listed in Part B of Annex I.\n(6)\nThe list in Part B of Annex I should include invertebrates, with the exception of bees and bumble bees covered by Directive 92/65/EEC, and molluscs and crustaceans covered by Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (6). It should also include ornamental aquatic animals reared in non-commercial aquaria excluded from the scope of Directive 2006/88/EC, and amphibians and reptiles.\n(7)\nThe list in Part B of Annex I should further include all species of birds, other than those covered by Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (7), and rodents and rabbits other than those intended for the production of food and defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (8).\n(8)\nHowever, in the interest of consistency of Union law, pending the establishment of Union rules governing the non-commercial movement into a Member State from another Member State or from a territory or a third country of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I, it should be possible for national rules to apply to such movement provided that they are not stricter than those applied to movement for commercial purposes.\n(9)\nSince animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I to this Regulation may belong to species that require particular protection, this Regulation should apply without prejudice to Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9 December 1996 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein (9).\n(10)\nIn order to make a clear distinction between the rules that apply to non-commercial movement and to trade in and imports into the Union from third countries of dogs, cats and ferrets covered by the animal health requirements of Directive 92/65/EEC, this Regulation should not only define a pet animal, but also the non-commercial movement of a pet animal, during which such a pet animal accompanies its owner or an authorised person. Experience has shown that it is not always possible for the pet animal to be in the immediate vicinity of the owner or authorised person at all times during non-commercial movement. On duly justified and documented grounds, the pet animal should be considered as accompanying its owner or the authorised person even if the non-commercial movement of the pet animal takes place up to five days earlier or later than the movement of the owner or of the authorised person, or takes place in a different physical location than that occupied by the owner or by the authorised person.\n(11)\nExperience with the application of the existing rules shows that trade in and imports into the Union from third countries of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I can be fraudulently disguised as non-commercial movement. In order to prevent such practices, since they might pose animal health risks, this Regulation should fix a maximum number of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I that may accompany their owner or an authorised person. However, it should be possible to exceed that maximum number under certain specified conditions. Further, it should be clarified that when the specified conditions are not fulfilled and the number of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I to this Regulation exceeds the established maximum number, the relevant provisions of Directive 92/65/EEC and of Directive 90/425/EEC (10) or Directive 91/496/EEC (11) apply to those pet animals.\n(12)\nRegulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides that, for a transitional period, pet animals of the species listed in Parts A and B of Annex I thereto are to be regarded as identified when they bear either a clear readable tattoo or an electronic identification system (‘transponder’). This Regulation should therefore lay down rules for the marking of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I to this Regulation after expiry of the transitional period on 3 July 2011.\n(13)\nThe implantation of a transponder is an invasive intervention and certain qualifications are required to carry it out. Transponders should therefore be implanted only by a suitably qualified person. If a Member State allows a person other than veterinarians to implant transponders, it should lay down rules on the minimum qualifications required for such a person.\n(14)\nAnnex Ia to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 sets out technical requirements for the identification of pet animals by transponders. Those technical requirements correspond to internationally accepted standards and should be set out, without any substantial amendments being made to them, in Annex II to this Regulation.\n(15)\nIn order to protect public health and the health of pet animals of the species listed in Annex I, this Regulation should provide for the possibility to adopt preventive health measures for diseases and infections other than rabies. Those measures should be based on validated scientific information and applied proportionately to the risk to public or animal health associated with the non-commercial movement of those pet animals likely to be affected by those diseases or infections. The measures should include rules for the categorisation of Member States or parts thereof, procedures under which Member States that require the application of preventive health measures should substantiate the rationale for such measures on a continuous basis, conditions for applying and documenting the preventive health measures and, where appropriate, conditions for derogating from the application of those measures. A list of Member States or parts thereof categorised pursuant to the relevant rules should therefore be set out in an implementing act to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(16)\nIt is possible that rabies vaccines administered to pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I before the age of three months do not induce protective immunity due to competition with maternal antibodies. Consequently, vaccine manufacturers recommend not to vaccinate young pet animals before that age. Therefore, in order to authorise the non-commercial movement of young pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I that have not been vaccinated, or that have been vaccinated, but have not yet acquired protective immunity against rabies, this Regulation should establish certain precautionary measures to be taken and give the Member States the possibility to authorise such movement into their territory when young pet animals comply with those measures.\n(17)\nIn order to simplify the conditions for the non-commercial movement of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I between Member States of equivalent favourable status with regard to rabies, this Regulation should also provide for the possibility to derogate from the anti-rabies vaccination requirement. Such a possibility should be available upon submission of a joint application by the Member States interested. Such a derogation should be based on validated scientific information and be applied proportionately to the risk to public or animal health associated with the non-commercial movement of those animals likely to be affected by rabies. Member States or parts thereof benefiting from such a derogation should be listed in an implementing act to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(18)\nCountries and territories listed in Section 2 of Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 apply rules equivalent to those applied by Member States while those listed in Part C of Annex II to that Regulation comply with the criteria laid down in Article 10 of that Regulation. Those lists should be set out, without any substantial amendments being made to them, in an implementing act to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(19)\nFurthermore, a list of territories or third countries that apply rules the content and effect of which are the same as those laid down in this Regulation for pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I should be set out in an implementing act to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(20)\nRegulation (EC) No 998/2003 lays down certain requirements for the non-commercial movement of pet animals into Member States from other Member States and from countries or territories listed in Section 2 of Part B and in Part C of Annex II thereto. Those requirements include a valid anti-rabies vaccination carried out on the pet animals in question with vaccines complying with the minimum standards laid down in the relevant Chapter of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), or for which a marketing authorisation has been granted in accordance with either Directive 2001/82/EC (12) or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (13).Those vaccines have proven to be effective in protecting animals against rabies and form part of the validity requirements for the anti-rabies vaccination set out in Annex Ib to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. Those requirements should be set out, without any substantial amendments being made to them, in Annex III to this Regulation.\n(21)\nRegulation (EC) No 998/2003 lays down more stringent animal health requirements for pet animals moved into Member States from countries or territories other than those listed in Part C of Annex II thereto. Those requirements include checks on the effectiveness in individual animals of the anti-rabies vaccination by titration of antibodies in a laboratory approved in accordance with Council Decision 2000/258/EC of 20 March 2000 designating a specific institute responsible for establishing the criteria necessary for standardising the serological tests to monitor the effectiveness of rabies vaccines (14). That requirement should therefore be maintained in Annex IV to this Regulation and a condition should be included that the test should be performed in accordance with the methods laid down in the relevant Chapter of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).\n(22)\nIdentification documents accompanying pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I which are subject to non-commercial movement into Member States are necessary to attest compliance with this Regulation. This Regulation should therefore establish the conditions for issuing identification documents and the requirements for their content, validity, security features, format and layout.\n(23)\nThis Regulation should allow Member States to authorise the non-commercial movement into their territory of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I accompanied by an identification document issued in a territory or a third country which applies rules the content and effect of which are the same as those applied by Member States. It should also allow Member States to authorise the non-commercial movement into their territory after a movement to a territory or a third country of those pet animals accompanied by an identification document issued in a Member State provided that the conditions to return from those territories or third countries are met before the pet animal left the Union.\n(24)\nThis Regulation should also give Member States the possibility to authorise, where the need for the urgent departure of the owner arises, for example, in the event of a sudden natural disaster, political unrest or other force majeure relating to the owner, the direct entry into their territory of pet animals of the species listed in Annex I which do not comply with this Regulation provided that a permit is applied for in advance and granted by the Member State of destination, and a time-limited period of isolation under official supervision is carried out to fulfil the conditions of this Regulation. Despite the need for such urgent departure, such permits are indispensable due to the animal health risks arising from the introduction into the Union of a pet animal that does not comply with this Regulation.\n(25)\nDirective 90/425/EEC and Directive 91/496/EEC do not apply to veterinary checks on pet animals accompanying travellers during non-commercial movement.\n(26)\nTherefore, in order for the Member States to verify compliance with this Regulation and to take the necessary action, this Regulation should require the person accompanying the pet animal to present the required identification document at the time of any non-commercial movement into a Member State and should provide for appropriate documentary and identity checks on pet animals accompanying their owner during non-commercial movement into a Member State from another Member State or from certain territories or third countries.\n(27)\nIt should also require Member States to carry out systematic documentary and identity checks at designated entry points on pet animals accompanying their owner during non-commercial movement into a Member State from certain territories or third countries. Those checks should take account of the relevant principles of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and welfare rules (15). Where necessary for the purpose of further movement into other Member States, Member States should be required to document the checks in the identification document in order to be able to use the date of these checks to determine the period of validity of the identification document.\n(28)\nIn addition, this Regulation should provide for safeguard measures for the purpose of dealing with risks to public or animal health arising from the non-commercial movement of pet animals.\n(29)\nWith a view to providing the citizen with clear and accessible information concerning the rules that apply to the non-commercial movement into the Union of pet animals of the species listed in Annex I, Member States should be required to make that information, in particular the relevant provisions of national law, available to the public.\n(30)\nIn order to ensure the proper application of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of species-specific requirements for the marking of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I and species-specific preventive health measures against diseases or infections other than rabies affecting the species listed in Annex I, as well as to adopt rules for limiting the number of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I accompanying their owner during non-commercial movement and to amend Annexes II to IV. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council.\n(31)\nIn addition, the power to adopt acts in accordance with the urgency procedure should be delegated to the Commission in duly justified cases of risks to public or animal health in respect of preventive health measures against diseases or infections other than rabies likely to affect pet animals of the species listed in Annex I.\n(32)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission with respect to the list of Member States or parts thereof that have equivalent favourable status with regard to rabies and that are authorised to conclude mutual agreements to derogate from certain conditions applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals, the list of Member States categorised in accordance with the rules concerning preventive health measures against diseases and infections other than rabies, the lists of territories and third countries established for the purpose of derogating from certain conditions applicable to non-commercial movement, the model for the identification documents that are to accompany pet animals of the species listed in Annex I during non-commercial movement into a Member State from another Member State or from a territory or a third country, the rules on the format, layout and languages of the declarations to be signed, and the safeguard measures in the event of the occurrence or spread of rabies or of a disease or infection other than rabies. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (16).\n(33)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts updating the list of Member States or parts thereof, with equivalent favourable status with regard to rabies, that are authorised to conclude mutual agreements to derogate from certain conditions applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and the list of territories or third countries established for the purpose of derogating from certain conditions applicable to non-commercial movement, and regarding safeguard measures in the event of the occurrence or spread of rabies or of a disease or infection other than rabies, where, in duly justified cases, related to animal and public health, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(34)\nCertain failures to comply with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 have been revealed in a number of Member States. Accordingly, Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation.\n(35)\nCommission Decision 2003/803/EC of 26 November 2003 establishing a model passport for the intra-Community movement of dogs, cats and ferrets (17) establishes the model passport for the movement of pet animals of the species dogs, cats and ferrets between Member States under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. Identification documents issued in accordance with that model passport should, subject to certain conditions, remain valid for the lifespan of a pet animal in order to limit the administrative and financial burden on owners.\n(36)\nCommission Implementing Decision 2011/874/EU of 15 December 2011 laying down the list of third countries and territories authorised for imports of dogs, cats and ferrets and for non-commercial movements of more than five dogs, cats and ferrets into the Union and the model certificates for imports and non-commercial movement of those animals into the Union (18) establishes the model health certificate attesting compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 for the non-commercial movement of five or fewer dogs, cats or ferrets into the Union. For the purpose of ensuring a smooth transition to the new rules laid down in this Regulation, that model certificate should remain valid subject to certain conditions.\n(37)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to lay down animal health requirements for the non-commercial movement of pet animals of the species listed in Annex I in order to prevent or minimise risks to public or animal health arising from such movement, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(38)\nIn order to ensure the simultaneous publication of this Regulation and of the implementing acts regarding the lists of territories and third countries established for the purpose of derogating from certain conditions applicable to non-commercial movement, regarding the model for the identification documents that are to accompany pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I during non-commercial movement into a Member State from another Member State or from a territory or a third country, and regarding the rules on the format, layout and languages of the declarations to be signed, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and the rules for compliance checks on such movement.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to the non-commercial movement of pet animals into a Member State from another Member State or from a territory or a third country.\n2.   This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to:\n(a)\nRegulation (EC) No 338/97;\n(b)\nany national measures adopted, published and made available to the public by Member States to restrict the movement of certain species or breeds of pet animals on the basis of considerations other than those relating to animal health.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘non-commercial movement’ means any movement which does not have as its aim either the sale of or the transfer of ownership of a pet animal;\n(b)\n‘pet animal’ means an animal of a species listed in Annex I accompanying its owner or an authorised person during non-commercial movement, and which remains for the duration of such non-commercial movement under the responsibility of the owner or the authorised person;\n(c)\n‘owner’ means a natural person indicated as the owner in the identification document;\n(d)\n‘authorised person’ means any natural person who has authorisation in writing from the owner to carry out the non-commercial movement of the pet animal on behalf of the owner;\n(e)\n‘transponder’ means a read-only passive radio frequency identification device;\n(f)\n‘identification document’ means a document drawn up in accordance with the model set out in implementing acts to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation, that enables the pet animal to be clearly identified and its health status to be checked for compliance with this Regulation;\n(g)\n‘authorised veterinarian’ means any veterinarian who has been authorised by the competent authority to carry out specific tasks in accordance with this Regulation or with acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation;\n(h)\n‘official veterinarian’ means any veterinarian appointed by the competent authority;\n(i)\n‘documentary check’ means verification of the identification document accompanying the pet animal;\n(j)\n‘identity check’ means verification for consistency between the identification document and the pet animal and where appropriate, for the presence and conformity of the marking;\n(k)\n‘travellers’ point of entry’ means any area designated by Member States for the purposes of the checks referred to in Article 34(1).\nArticle 4\nGeneral obligation\nNon-commercial movement of pet animals that complies with the animal health requirements laid down in this Regulation shall not be prohibited, restricted or impeded on animal health grounds other than those resulting from the application of this Regulation.\nArticle 5\nMaximum number of pet animals\n1.   The maximum number of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I which may accompany the owner or an authorised person during a single non-commercial movement shall not exceed five.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the maximum number of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I may exceed five if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe non-commercial movement of pet animals is for the purpose of participating in competitions, exhibitions or sporting events or in training for such events;\n(b)\nthe owner or the authorised person submits written evidence that the pet animals are registered either to attend an event referred to in point (a), or with an association organising such events;\n(c)\nthe pet animals are more than six months old.\n3.   Member States may undertake standard spot checks to verify that the information submitted under point (b) of paragraph 2 is correct.\n4.   Where the maximum number of pet animals referred to in paragraph 1 is exceeded and the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 are not fulfilled, those pet animals shall comply with the animal health requirements laid down in Directive 92/65/EEC for the species concerned and Member States shall ensure that those animals are subject to the veterinary checks provided for in Directives 90/425/EEC or 91/496/EEC, as appropriate.\n5.   In order to prevent commercial movement of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I from being fraudulently disguised as non-commercial movement, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 39 laying down rules setting the maximum number of pet animals of those species that may accompany the owner or an authorised person during a single non-commercial movement.\n6.   The Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this Article not later than 29 June 2018. The Commission shall, where necessary, propose amendments to this Regulation on the basis of its report.\nCHAPTER II\nCONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE NON-COMMERCIAL MOVEMENT OF PET ANIMALS INTO A MEMBER STATE FROM ANOTHER MEMBER STATE\nSECTION 1\nPet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I\nArticle 6\nConditions applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I\nPet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I shall not be moved into a Member State from another Member State unless they fulfil the following conditions:\n(a)\nthey are marked in accordance with Article 17(1);\n(b)\nthey have received an anti-rabies vaccination that complies with the validity requirements set out in Annex III;\n(c)\nthey comply with any preventive health measures for diseases or infections other than rabies adopted pursuant to Article 19(1);\n(d)\nthey are accompanied by an identification document duly completed and issued in accordance with Article 22.\nArticle 7\nDerogation from the anti-rabies vaccination condition for young pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I\n1.   Subject to paragraph 2, Member States may, by way of derogation from point (b) of Article 6, authorise the non-commercial movement into their territory from another Member State of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I, which are:\n(a)\neither less than 12 weeks old and have not received an anti-rabies vaccination; or\n(b)\nbetween 12 and 16 weeks old and have received an anti-rabies vaccination, but do not yet meet the validity requirements referred to in point 2(e) of Annex III.\n2.   The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 may be granted only if:\n(a)\neither the owner or the authorised person provides a signed declaration that from birth until the time of the non-commercial movement the pet animals have had no contact with wild animals of species susceptible to rabies; or\n(b)\nthe pet animals are accompanied by their mother, on whom they still depend, and from the identification document accompanying their mother it can be established that, before their birth, the mother received an anti-rabies vaccination which complied with the validity requirements set out in Annex III.\n3.   The Commission may, by means of an implementing act, adopt rules on the format, layout and languages of the declarations referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 of this Article. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 41(2).\nArticle 8\nDerogation from the anti-rabies vaccination condition for pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I\n1.   By way of derogation from point (b) of Article 6, the direct non-commercial movement between Member States or parts thereof, of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I that have not been vaccinated against rabies, may be authorised in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 2 upon a joint application by the Member States concerned.\n2.   The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, adopt a list of Member States that are authorised to conclude mutual agreements to derogate from point (b) of Article 6 in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article. That list shall set out the parts of those Member States for which the derogation may apply.\n3.   In order to be included in the list referred to in paragraph 2, the Member States interested in such a mutual agreement shall submit a joint application to the Commission, including details of the draft agreement, by which they can demonstrate, taking into account the procedures in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for self-declaration as to the freedom of a country or zone from rabies, that they fulfil at least the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe applicant Member States shall have in operation ongoing surveillance and reporting systems with regard to rabies;\n(b)\nthe applicant Member States, or the parts of their territory for which the application is made, shall have been free of rabies and rabies shall not be known to have been established in wild animals in the territory of the Member States concerned, or parts thereof, for at least the two years prior to the joint application on the basis of the systems referred to in point (a);\n(c)\nthe applicant Member States shall have in place efficient and effective control measures to prevent the introduction into and spread within their territory of rabies;\n(d)\nthe application of the derogation from point (b) of Article 6 shall be justified and proportionate to the risks to public or animal health associated with the direct non-commercial movement from one of the applicant Member States to the other or part of its territory of non-vaccinated pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I.\nThe joint application shall contain adequate, reliable and scientifically validated information.\n4.   The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, remove Member States from the list referred to in paragraph 2 for the whole or part of their territories should any change in the particulars specified in paragraph 3 no longer support the application of the derogation.\n5.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 41(2).\n6.   On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to risks to public or animal health, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts updating the list of Member States or parts thereof referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 41(3).\nSECTION 2\nPet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I\nArticle 9\nConditions applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I\n1.   Insofar as the Commission has adopted a delegated act pursuant to Article 19(1) with regard to pet animals of one of the species listed in Part B of Annex I, the non-commercial movement of pet animals of that species into a Member State from another Member State shall be subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article.\n2.   Pet animals of the species referred to in paragraph 1 may be moved into a Member State from another Member State only if they fulfil the following conditions:\n(a)\nthey are marked or described according to the requirements adopted pursuant to Article 17(2);\n(b)\nthey comply with any preventive health measures for diseases or infections other than rabies adopted pursuant to Article 19(1);\n(c)\nthey are accompanied by an identification document duly completed and issued in accordance with Article 29.\n3.   Pending the adoption of the relevant delegated acts referred to in paragraph 1, Member States may apply national rules to the non-commercial movement of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I into their territory from another Member State, provided that such rules are:\n(a)\napplied proportionately to the risk to public or animal health associated with the non-commercial movement of the pet animals of those species; and\n(b)\nnot stricter than those applied to trade in animals of those species in accordance with Directives 92/65/EEC or 2006/88/EC.\nCHAPTER III\nCONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE NON-COMMERCIAL MOVEMENT OF PET ANIMALS INTO A MEMBER STATE FROM A TERRITORY OR A THIRD COUNTRY\nSECTION 1\nPet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I\nArticle 10\nConditions applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I\n1.

the welfare of dogs and cats involved in commercial practices.\nIf the outcome of that study indicates health risks arising from those commercial practices, the Commission will consider appropriate options for the protection of human and animal health, including proposing to the European Parliament and to the Council appropriate adaptations to current Union legislation on trade in dogs and cats, including the introduction of compatible systems for their registration accessible across Member States.\nIn light of the above, the Commission will assess the feasibility and appropriateness of an extension of such registration systems to dogs and cats marked and identified in accordance with Union legislation on non-commercial movements of pet animals.\n(1)  COM(2012) 6 final/2 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the European Union Strategy for the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2012-2015.", "summary": "Non-commercial movements of pet animals\nNon-commercial movements of pet animals\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 576/2013 on formalities for pet animals travelling between EU countries\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt aims to ease formalities for the owners of dogs, cats and ferrets when travelling with their pets.\nKEY POINTS\nThis law applies to non-commercial movement of pet animals into an EU country from another EU country, a territory or a non-EU country. It builds on the existing pets’ passport scheme and introduces a new model of passport.\nCats, dogs and ferrets can travel with their owners within the EU if they have a passport that contains proof of their identity and their anti-rabies vaccination.\nTo travel between EU countries, pets must:\nbe marked (by means of a transponder* or tattoo);\nhave received an anti-rabies vaccination;\ncomply with any preventive health measures for diseases other than rabies;\nbe accompanied by a passport completed and issued by an authorised vet.\nThe specifications for the new passport are laid down by the European Commission in Regulation (EU) No 577/2013. The passport includes information such as:\nthe location of the transponder or the tattoo and the alphanumeric code displayed by the transponder or the tattoo;\nthe name, species, breed, sex, colour, date of birth and any noteworthy characteristics of the pet;\nowner’s and authorised vet’s details;\ndetails of the anti-rabies vaccination.\nTo enter the EU, pets from non-EU countries must meet the same minimum conditions. Depending on the non-EU country’s rabies status, there may be additional strict requirements to be met, including a blood test carried out after vaccination and verified by an approved laboratory.\nThe previously existing model of passport, if it was issued before 29 December 2014, will remain valid.\nWhere rabies or a disease other than rabies occurs, the non-commercial movement or transit of pet animals may be suspended from all or part of the territory of the EU country or non-EU country concerned.\nEU countries must provide the public with clear and easily accessible informationnternet concerning the requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pets and the rules for compliance checks on such movement. They must also publishnternet this information on the internet.\nExceptions\nEU countries may allow the non-commercial movement into their territory from another EU country of pets which are either:\nunder 12 weeks old and have not received an anti-rabies vaccination; or\nare between 12 and 16 weeks oldand have received an anti-rabies vaccination , but do not yet meet the vaccination validity requirements of the law.\nUnless the owners can prove that the animals are travelling to participate in sporting events or exhibitions, they may be accompanied by a maximum of 5 pets.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) 2016/429 repeals Regulation (EU) No 576/2013 with effect from 21 April 2021.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 29 December 2014.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Movement of pets’ on the European Commission's website\n* KEY TERM\n              \ntransponder: a read-only passive radio frequency identification device\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 576/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on the non-commercial movement of pet animals and repealing Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 (OJ L 178, 28.6.2013, pp. 1–26)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 577/2013 of 28 June 2013 on the model identification documents for the non-commercial movement of dogs, cats and ferrets, the establishment of lists of territories and third countries and the format, layout and language requirements of the declarations attesting compliance with certain conditions provided for in Regulation (EU) No 576/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 178, 28.6.2013, pp. 109–148)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 577/2013 have been incorporated in the original text.
