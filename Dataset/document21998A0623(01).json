For the purposes of this Convention:\n(1)\n‘area’ means the sea-bed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction;\n(2)\n‘Authority’ means the International Sea-Bed Authority;\n(3)\n‘activities in the area’ means all activities of exploration for, and exploitation of, the resources of the area;\n(4)\n‘pollution of the marine environment’ means the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the marine environment, including estuaries, which results or is likely to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine life, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea, impairment of quality for use of sea water and reduction of amenities;\n(5)\n(a)\n‘dumping’ means:\n(i)\nany deliberate disposal of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;\n(ii)\nany deliberate disposal of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;\n(b)\n‘dumping’ does not include:\n(i)\nthe disposal of wastes or other matter incidental to, or derived from the normal operations of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea and their equipment, other than wastes or other matter transported by or to vessels, air-craft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, operating for the purpose of disposal of such matter or derived from the treatment of such wastes or other matter on such vessels, aircraft, platforms or structures;\n(ii)\nplacement of matter for a purpose other than the mere disposal thereof, provided that such placement is not contrary to the aims of this Convention.\n2.\n(1)\n‘States Parties’ means States which have consented to be bound by this Convention and for which this convention is in force;\n(2)\nthis Convention applies mutatis mutandis to the entities referred to in Article 305(1) (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), which become parties to this Convention in accordance with the conditions relevant to each, and to that extent ‘States Parties’ refers to those entities.\nPART II\nTERRITORIAL SEA AND CONTIGUOUS ZONE\nSECTION 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 2\nLegal status of the territorial sea, of the air space over the territorial sea and of its bed and subsoil\n1.   The sovereignty of a coastal State extends, beyond its land territory and internal waters and, in the case of an archipelagic State, its archipelagic waters, to an adjacent belt of sea, described as the territorial sea.\n2.   This sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil.\n3.   The sovereignty over the territorial sea is exercised subject to this Convention and to other rules of international law.\nSECTION 2\nLIMITS OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA\nArticle 3\nBreadth of the territorial sea\nEvery State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles, measured from baselines determined in accordance with this Convention.\nArticle 4\nOuter limit of the territorial sea\nThe outer limit of the territorial sea is the line every point of which is at a distance from the nearest point of the baseline equal to the breadth of the territorial sea.\nArticle 5\nNormal baseline\nExcept where otherwise provided in this Convention, the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognised by the coastal State.\nArticle 6\nReefs\nIn the case of islands situated on atolls or of islands having fringing reefs, the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the seaward low-water line of the reef, as shown by the appropriate symbol on charts officially recognised by the coastal State.\nArticle 7\nStraight baselines\n1.   In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coasts in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.\n2.   Where because of the presence of a delta and other natural conditions the coastline is highly unstable, the appropriate points may be selected along the furthest seaward extent of the low-water line and, notwithstanding subsequent regression of the low-water line, the straight baselines shall remain effective until changed by the coastal State in accordance with this Convention.\n3.   The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters.\n4.   Straight baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them or except in instances where the drawing of baselines to and from such elevations has received general international recognition.\n5.   Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under point 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage.\n6.   The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off the territorial sea of another State from the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.\nArticle 8\nInternal waters\n1.   Except as provided in Part IV, waters on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial sea form part of the internal waters of the State.\n2.   Where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with the method set forth in Article 7 has the effect of enclosing as internal waters areas which had not previously been considered as such, a right of innocent passage as provided in this Convention shall exist in those waters.\nArticle 9\nMouths of rivers\nIf a river flows directly into the sea, the baseline shall be a straight line across the mouth of the river between points on the low-water line of its banks.\nArticle 10\nBays\n1.   This Article relates only to bays the coasts of which belong to a single State.\n2.   For the purposes of this Convention, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.\n3.   For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a line joining the low-water mark of its natural entrance points. Where, because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth, the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths of the lines across the different mouths. Islands within an indentation shall be included as if they were part of the water area of the indentation.\n4.   If the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay does not exceed 24 nautical miles, a closing line may be drawn between these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed thereby shall be considered as internal waters.\n5.   Where the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay exceeds 24 nautical miles, a straight baseline of 24 nautical miles shall be drawn within the bay in such a manner as to enclose the maximum area of water that is possible with a line of that length.\n6.   The foregoing provisions do not apply to so-called ‘historic’ bays, or in any case where the system of straight baselines provided for in Article 7 is applied.\nArticle 11\nPorts\nFor the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system are regarded as forming part of the coast. Off-shore installations and artificial islands shall not be considered as permanent harbour works.\nArticle 12\nRoadsteads\nRoadsteads which are normally used for the loading, unloading and anchoring of ships, and which would otherwise be situated wholly or partly outside the outer limit of the territorial sea, are included in the territorial sea.\nArticle 13\nLow-tide elevations\n1.   A low-tide elevation is a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide. Where a low-tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, the low-water line on that elevation may be used as the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea.\n2.   Where a low-tide elevation is wholly situated at a distance exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, it has no territorial sea of its own.\nArticle 14\nCombination of methods for determining baselines\nThe coastal State may determine baselines in turn by any of the methods provided for in the foregoing Articles to suit different conditions.\nArticle 15\nDelimitation of the territorial sea between States with opposite or adjacent coasts\nWhere the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however, where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way which is at variance therewith.\nArticle 16\nCharts and lists of geographical coordinates\n1.   The baselines for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea determined in accordance with Articles 7, 9 and 10, or the limits derived therefrom, and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with Articles 12 and 15 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Alternatively, a list of geographical coordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted.\n2.   The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical coordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nSECTION 3\nINNOCENT PASSAGE IN THE TERRITORIAL SEA\nSubsection A\nRules applicable to all ships\nArticle 17\nRight of innocent passage\nSubject to this Convention, ships of all States, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea.\nArticle 18\nMeaning of passage\n1.   Passage means navigation through the territorial sea for the purpose of:\n(a)\ntraversing that sea without entering internal waters or calling at a roadstead or port facility outside internal waters; or\n(b)\nproceeding to or from internal waters or a call at such roadstead or port facility.\n2.   Passage shall be continuous and expeditious. However, passage includes stopping and anchoring, but only in so far as the same are incidental to ordinary navigation or are rendered necessary by force majeure or distress or for the purpose of rendering assistance to persons, ships or aircraft in danger or distress.\nArticle 19\nMeaning of innocent passage\n1.   Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. Such passage shall take place in conformity with this Convention and with other rules of international law.\n2.   Passage of a foreign ship shall be considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State if in the territorial sea it engages in any of the following activities:\n(a)\nany threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of the coastal State, or in any other manner in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations;\n(b)\nany exercise or practice with weapons of any kind;\n(c)\nany act aimed at collecting information to the prejudice of the defence or security of the coastal State;\n(d)\nany act of propaganda aimed at affecting the defence or security of the coastal State;\n(e)\nthe launching, landing or taking on board of any aircraft;\n(f)\nthe launching, landing or taking on board of any military device;\n(g)\nthe loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State;\n(h)\nany act of wilful and serious pollution contrary to this Convention;\n(i)\nany fishing activities;\n(j)\nthe carrying out of research or survey activities;\n(k)\nany act aimed at interfering with any systems of communication or any other facilities or installations of the coastal State;\n(l)\nany other activity not having a direct bearing on passage.\nArticle 20\nSubmarines and other underwater vehicles\nIn the territorial sea, submarines and other underwater vehicles are required to navigate on the surface and to show their flag.\nArticle 21\nLaws and regulations of the coastal State relating to innocent passage\n1.   The coastal State may adopt laws and regulations, in conformity with the provisions of this Convention and other rules of international law, relating to innocent passage through the territorial sea, in respect of all or any of the following:\n(a)\nthe safety of navigation and the regulation of maritime traffic;\n(b)\nthe protection of navigational aids and facilities and other facilities or installations;\n(c)\nthe protection of cables and pipelines;\n(d)\nthe conservation of the living resources of the sea;\n(e)\nthe prevention of infringement of the fisheries laws and regulations of the coastal State;\n(f)\nthe preservation of the environment of the coastal State and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution thereof;\n(g)\nmarine scientific research and hydrographic surveys;\n(h)\nthe prevention of infringement of the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State.\n2.   Such laws and regulations shall not apply to the design, construction, manning or equipment of foreign ships unless they are giving effect to generally accepted international rules or standards.\n3.   The coastal State shall give due publicity to all such laws and regulations.\n4.   Foreign ships exercising the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea shall comply with all such laws and regulations and all generally accepted international regulations relating to the prevention of collisions at sea.\nArticle 22\nSea lanes and traffic separation schemes in the territorial sea\n1.   The coastal State may, where necessary having regard to the safety of navigation, require foreign ships exercising the right of innocent passage through its territorial sea to use such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes as it may designate or prescribe for the regulation of the passage of ships.\n2.   In particular, tankers, nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances or materials may be required to confine their passage to such sea lanes.\n3.   In the designation of sea lanes and the prescription of traffic separation schemes under this Article, the coastal State shall take into account:\n(a)\nthe recommendations of the competent international organisation;\n(b)\nany channels customarily used for international navigation;\n(c)\nthe special characteristics of particular ships and channels; and\n(d)\nthe density of traffic.\n4.   The coastal State shall clearly indicate such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes on charts to which due publicity shall be given.\nArticle 23\nForeign nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances\nForeign nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances shall, when exercising the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea, carry documents and observe special precautionary measures established for such ships by international agreements.\nArticle 24\nDuties of the coastal State\n1.   The coastal State shall not hamper the innocent passage of foreign ships through the territorial sea except in accordance with this Convention. In particular, in the application of this Convention or of any laws or regulations adopted in conformity with this Convention, the coastal State shall not:\n(a)\nimpose requirements on foreign ships which have the practical effect of denying or impairing the right of innocent passage; or\n(b)\ndiscriminate in form or in fact against the ships of any State or against ships carrying cargoes to, from or on behalf of any State.\n2.   The coastal State shall give appropriate publicity to any danger to navigation, of which it has knowledge, within its territorial sea.\nArticle 25\nRights of protection of the coastal State\n1.   The coastal State may take the necessary steps in its territorial sea to prevent passage which is not innocent.\n2.   In the case of ships proceeding to internal waters or a call at a port facility outside internal waters, the coastal State also has the right to take the necessary steps to prevent any breach of the conditions to which admission of those ships to internal waters or such a call is subject.\n3.   The coastal State may, without discrimination in form or in fact among foreign ships, suspend temporarily in specified areas of its territorial sea the innocent passage of foreign ships if such suspension is essential for the protection of its security, including weapons exercises. Such suspension shall take effect only after having been duly published.\nArticle 26\nCharges which may be levied on foreign ships\n1.   No charge may be levied on foreign ships by reason only of their passage through the territorial sea.\n2.   Charges may be levied on a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea as payment only for specific services rendered to the ship. These charges shall be levied without discrimination.\nSubsection B\nRules applicable to merchant ships and government ships operated for commercial purposes\nArticle 27\nCriminal jurisdiction on board a foreign ship\n1.   The criminal jurisdiction of the coastal State should not be exercised on board a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea to arrest any person or to conduct any investigation in connection with any crime committed on board the ship during its passage, save only in the following cases:\n(a)\nif the consequences of the crime extend to the coastal State;\n(b)\nif the crime is of a kind to disturb the peace of the country or the good order of the territorial sea;\n(c)\nif the assistance of the local authorities has been requested by the master of the ship or by a diplomatic agent or consular officer of the flag State; or\n(d)\nif such measures are necessary for the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.\n2.   The above provisions do not affect the right of the coastal State to take any steps authorised by its laws for the purpose of an arrest or investigation on board a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea after leaving internal waters.\n3.   In the cases provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2, the coastal State shall, if the master so requests, notify a diplomatic agent or consular officer of the flag State before taking any steps, and shall facilitate contact between such agent or officer and the ship's crew. In cases of emergency this notification may be communicated while the measures are being taken.\n4.   In considering whether or in what manner an arrest should be made, the local authorities shall have due regard to the interests of navigation.\n5.   Except as provided in Part XII or with respect to violations of laws and regulations adopted in accordance with Part V, the coastal State may not take any steps on board a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea to arrest any person or to conduct any investigation in connection with any crime committed before the ship entered the territorial sea, if the ship, proceeding from a foreign port, is only passing through the territorial sea without entering internal waters.\nArticle 28\nCivil jurisdiction in relation to foreign ships\n1.   The coastal State should not stop or divert a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea for the purpose of exercising civil jurisdiction in relation to a person on board the ship.\n2.   The coastal State may not levy execution against or arrest the ship for the purpose of any civil proceedings, save only in respect of obligations or liabilities assumed or incurred by the ship itself in the course or for the purpose of its voyage through the waters of the coastal State.\n3.   Paragraph 2 is without prejudice to the right of the coastal State, in accordance with its laws, to levy execution against or to arrest, for the purpose of any civil proceedings, a foreign ship lying in the territorial sea, or passing through the territorial sea after leaving internal waters.\nSubsection C\nRules applicable to warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes\nArticle 29\nDefinition of warships\nFor the purposes of this Convention, ‘warship’ means a ship belonging to the armed forces of a State bearing the external marks distinguishing such ships of its nationality, under the command of an officer duly commissioned by the government of the State and whose name appears in the appropriate service list or its equivalent, and manned by a crew which is under regular armed forces discipline.\nArticle 30\nNon-compliance by warships with the laws and regulations of the coastal State\nIf any warship does not comply with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea and disregards any request for compliance therewith which is made to it, the coastal State may require it to leave the territorial sea immediately.\nArticle 31\nResponsibility of the flag State for damage caused by a warship or other government ship operated for non-commercial purposes\nThe flag State shall bear international responsibility for any loss or damage to the coastal State resulting from the non-compliance by a warship or other government ship operated for non-commercial purposes with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea or with the provisions of this Convention or other rules of international law.\nArticle 32\nImmunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes\nWith such exceptions as are contained in subsection A and in Articles 30 and 31, nothing in this Convention affects the immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes.\nSECTION 4\nCONTIGUOUS ZONE\nArticle 33\nContiguous zone\n1.   In a zone contiguous to its territorial sea, described as the contiguous zone, the coastal State may exercise the control necessary to:\n(a)\nprevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea;\n(b)\npunish infringement of the above laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea.\n2.   The contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.\nPART III\nSTRAITS USED FOR INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION\nSECTION 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 34\nLegal status of waters forming straits used for international navigation\n1.   The regime of passage through straits used for international navigation established in this part shall not in other respects affect the legal status of the waters forming such straits or the exercise by the States bordering the straits of their sovereignty or jurisdiction over such water and their air space, bed and subsoil.\n2.   The sovereignty or jurisdiction of the States bordering the straits is exercised subject to this part and to other rules of international law.\nArticle 35\nScope of this part\nNothing in this part affects:\n(a)\nany areas of internal waters within a strait, except where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with the method set forth in Article 7 has the effect of enclosing as internal waters areas which had not previously been considered as such;\n(b)\nthe legal status of the waters beyond the territorial seas of States bordering straits as exclusive economic zones or high seas; or\n(c)\nthe legal regime in straits in which passage is regulated in whole or in part by long-standing international conventions in force specifically relating to such straits.\nArticle 36\nHigh seas routes or routes through exclusive economic zones through straits used for international navigation\nThis part does not apply to a strait used for international navigation if there exists through the strait a route through the high seas or through an exclusive economic zone of similar convenience with respect to navigational and hydrographical characteristics; in such routes, the other relevant parts of this Convention, including the provisions regarding the freedoms of navigation and overflight, apply.\nSECTION 2\nTRANSIT PASSAGE\nArticle 37\nScope of this section\nThis section applies to straits which are used for international navigation between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.\nArticle 38\nRight of transit passage\n1.   In straits referred to in Article 37, all ships and aircraft enjoy the right of transit passage, which shall not be impeded; except that, if the strait is formed by an island of a State bordering the strait and its mainland, transit passage shall not apply if there exists seaward of the island a route through the high seas or through an exclusive economic zone of similar convenience with respect to navigational and hydrographical characteristics.\n2.   Transit passage means the exercise in accordance with this part of the freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone. However, the requirement of continuous and expeditious transit does not preclude passage through the strait for the purpose of entering, leaving or returning from a State bordering the strait, subject to the conditions of entry to that State.\n3.   Any activity which is not an exercise of the right of transit passage through a strait remains subject to the other applicable provisions of this Convention.\nArticle 39\nDuties of ships and aircraft during transit passage\n1.   Ships and aircraft, while exercising the right of transit passage, shall:\n(a)\nproceed without delay through or over the strait;\n(b)\nrefrain from any threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of States bordering the strait, or in any other manner in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations;\n(c)\nrefrain from any activities other than those incident to their normal modes of continuous and expeditious transit unless rendered necessary by force majeure or by distress;\n(d)\ncomply with other relevant provisions of this part.\n2.   Ships in transit passage shall:\n(a)\ncomply with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices for safety at sea, including the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea;\n(b)\ncomply with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from ships.\n3.   Aircraft in transit passage shall:\n(a)\nobserve the Rules of the Air established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation as they apply to civil aircraft; State aircraft will normally comply with such safety measures and will at all times operate with due regard for the safety of navigation;\n(b)\nat all times monitor the radio frequency assigned by the competent internationally designated air traffic control authority or the appropriate international distress radio frequency.\nArticle 40\nResearch and survey activities\nDuring transit passage, foreign ships, including marine scientific research and hydrographic survey ships, may not carry out any research or survey activities without the prior authorisation of the States bordering straits.\nArticle 41\nSea lanes and traffic separation schemes in straits used for international navigation\n1.   In conforrnjty with this part, States bordering straits may designate sea lanes and prescribe traffic separation schemes for navigation in straits where necessary to promote the safe passage of ships.\n2.   Such States may, when circumstances require, and after giving due publicity thereto, substitute other sea lanes or traffic separation schemes for any sea lanes or traffic separation schemes previously designated or prescribed by them.\n3.   Such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes shall conform to generally accepted international regulations.\n4.   Before designating or substituting sea lanes or prescribing or substituting traffic separation schemes, States bordering straits shall refer proposals to the competent international organisation with a view to their adoption. The organisation may adopt only such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes as may be agreed with the States bordering the straits, after which the States may designate, prescribe or substitute them.\n5.   In respect of a strait where sea lanes or traffic separation schemes through the waters of two or more States bordering the strait are being proposed, the States concerned shall cooperate in formulating proposals in consultation with the competent international organisation.\n6.   States bordering straits shall clearly indicate all sea lanes and traffic separation schemes designated or prescribed by them on charts to which due publicity shall be given.\n7.   Ships in transit passage shall respect applicable sea lanes and traffic separation schemes established in accordance with this Article.\nArticle 42\nLaws and regulations of States bordering straits relating to transit passage\n1.   Subject to the provisions of this section, States bordering straits may adopt laws and regulations relating to transit passage through straits, in respect of all or any of the following:\n(a)\nthe safety of navigation and the regulation of maritime traffic, as provided in Article 41;\n(b)\nthe prevention, reduction and control of pollution, by giving effect to applicable international regulations regarding the discharge of oil, oily wastes and other noxious substances in the strait;\n(c)\nwith respect to fishing vessels, the prevention of fishing, including the stowage of fishing gear;\n(d)\nthe loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person in contravention of the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of States bordering straits.\n2.   Such laws and regulations shall not discriminate in form or in fact among foreign ships or in their application have the practical effect of denying, hampering or impairing the right of transit passage as defined in this section.\n3.   States bordering straits shall give due publicity to all such laws and regulations.\n4.   Foreign ships exercising the right of transit passage shall comply with such laws and regulations.\n5.   The flag State of a ship or the State of registry of an aircraft entitled to sovereign immunity which acts in a manner contrary to such laws and regulations or other provisions of this part shall bear international responsibility for any loss or damage which results to States bordering straits.\nArticle 43\nNavigational and safety aids and other improvements and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution\nUser States and States bordering a strait should by agreement cooperate:\n(a)\nin the establishment and maintenance in a strait of necessary navigational and safety aids or other improvements in aid of international navigation; and\n(b)\nfor the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from ships.\nArticle 44\nDuties of States bordering straits\nStates bordering straits shall not hamper transit passage and shall give appropriate publicity to any danger to navigation or overflight within or over the strait of which they have knowledge. There shall be no suspension of transit passage.\nSECTION 3\nINNOCENT PASSAGE\nArticle 45\nInnocent passage\n1.   The regime of innocent passage, in accordance with Part II, Section 3, shall apply in straits used for international navigation:\n(a)\nexcluded from the application of the regime of transit passage under Article 38(1); or\n(b)\nbetween a part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and the territorial sea of a foreign State.\n2.   There shall be no suspension of innocent passage through such straits.\nPART IV\nARCHIPELAGIC STATES\nArticle 46\nUse of terms\nFor the purposes of this Convention:\n(a)\n‘archipelagic State’ means a State constituted wholly by one or more archipelagos and may include other islands;\n(b)\n‘archipelago’ means a group of islands, including parts of islands, interconnecting waters and other natural features which are so closely interrelated that such islands, waters and other natural features form an intrinsic geographical, economic and political entity, or which historically have been regarded as such.\nArticle 47\nArchipelagic baselines\n1.   An archipelagic State may draw straight archipelagic baselines joining the outermost points of the outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago provided that within such baselines are included the main islands and an area in which the ratio of the area of the water to the area of the land, including atolls, is between 1 to 1 and 9 to1:\n2.   The length of such baselines shall not exceed 100 nautical miles, except that up to 3 % of the total number of baselines enclosing any archipelago may exceed that length, up to a maximum length of 125 nautical miles.\n3.   The drawing of such baselines shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago.\n4.   Such baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them or where a low-tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the nearest island.\n5.   The system of such baselines shall not be applied by an archipelagic State in such a manner as to cut off from the high seas or the exclusive economic zone the territorial sea of another State.\n6.   If a part of the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic State lies between two parts of an immediately adjacent neighbouring State, existing rights and all other legitimate interests which the latter State has traditionally exercised in such waters and all rights stipulated by agreement between those States shall continue and be respected.\n7.   For the purpose of computing the ratio of water to land under paragraph 1, land areas may include waters lying within the fringing reefs of islands and atolls, including that part of a steep-sided oceanic plateau which is enclosed or nearly enclosed by a chain of limestone islands and drying reefs lying on the perimeter of the plateau.\n8.   The baselines drawn in accordance with this Article shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Alternatively, lists of geographical coordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted.\n9.   The archipelagic State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical coordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nArticle 48\nMeasurement of the breadth of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf\nThe breadth of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf shall be measured from archipelagic baselines drawn in accordance with Article 47.\nArticle 49\nLegal status of archipelagic waters, of the air space over archipelagic waters and of their bed and subsoil\n1.   The sovereignty of an archipelagic State extends to the waters enclosed by the archipelagic baselines drawn in accordance with Article 47, described as archipelagic waters, regardless of their depth or distance from the coast.\n2.   This sovereignty extends to the air space over the archipelagic waters, as well as to their bed and subsoil, and the resources contained therein.\n3.   This sovereignty is exercised subject to this part.\n4.   The regime of archipelagic sea lanes passage established in this part shall not in other respects affect the status of the archipelagic waters, including the sea lanes, or the exercise by the archipelagic State of its sovereignty over such waters and their air space, bed and subsoil, and the resources contained therein.\nArticle 50\nDelimitation of internal waters\nWithin its archipelagic waters, the archipelagic State may draw closing lines for the delimitation of internal waters, in accordance with Articles 9, 10 and 11.\nArticle 51\nExisting agreements, traditional fishing rights and existing submarine cables\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 49, an archipelagic State shall respect existing agreements with other States and shall recognise traditional fishing rights and other legitimate activities of the immediately adjacent neighbouring States in certain areas falling within archipelagic waters. The terms and conditions for the exercise of such rights and activities, including the nature, the extent and the areas to which they apply, shall, at the request of any of the States concerned, be regulated by bilateral agreements between them. Such rights shall not be transferred to or shared with third States or their nationals.\n2.   An archipelagic State shall respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. An archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables on receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them.\nArticle 52\nRight of innocent passage\n1.   Subject to Article 53 and without prejudice to Article 50, ships of all States enjoy the right of innocent passage through archipelagic waters, in accordance with Part II, Section 3.\n2.   The archipelagic State may, without discrimination in form or in fact among foreign ships, suspend temporarily in specified areas of its archipelagic waters the innocent passage of foreign ships if such suspension is essential for the protection of its security. Such suspension shall take effect only after having been duly published.\nArticle 53\nRight of archipelagic sea lanes passage\n1.   An archipelagic State may designate sea lanes and air routes thereabove, suitable for the continuous and expeditious passage of foreign ships and aircraft through or over its archipelagic waters and the adjacent territorial sea.\n2.   All ships and aircraft enjoy the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage in such sea lanes and air routes.\n3.   Archipelagic sea lanes passage means the exercise in accordance with this Convention of the rights of navigation and overflight in the normal mode solely for the purpose of continuous, expeditious and unobstructed transit between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.\n4.   Such sea lanes and air routes shall traverse the archipelagic waters and the adjacent territorial sea and shall include all normal passage routes used as routes for international navigation or overflight through or over archipelagic waters and, within such routes, so far as ships are concerned, all normal navigational channels, provided that duplication of routes of similar convenience between the same entry and exit points shall not be necessary.\n5.   Such sea lanes and air routes shall be defined by a series of continuous axis lines from the entry points of passage routes to the exit points. Ships and aircraft in archipelagic sea lanes passage shall not deviate more than 25 nautical miles to either side of such axis lines during passage, provided that such ships and aircraft shall not navigate closer to the coasts than 10 % of the distance between the nearest points on islands bordering the sea lane.\n6.   An archipelagic State which designates sea lanes under this Article may also prescribe traffic separation schemes for the safe passage of ships through narrow channels in such sea lanes.\n7.   An archipelagic State may, when circumstances require, after giving due publicity thereto, substitute other sea lanes or traffic separation schemes for any sea lanes or traffic separation schemes previously designated or prescribed by it.\n8.   Such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes shall conform to generally accepted international regulations.\n9.   In designating or substituting sea lanes or prescribing or substituting traffic separation schemes, an archipelagic State shall refer proposals to the competent international organisation with a view to their adoption. The organisation may adopt only such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes as may be agreed with the archipelagic State, after which the archipelagic State may designate, prescribe or substitute them.\n10.   The archipelagic State shall clearly indicate the axis of the sea lanes and the traffic separation schemes designated or prescribed by it on charts to which due publicity shall be given.\n11.   Ships in archipelagic sea lanes passage shall respect applicable sea lanes and traffic separation schemes established in accordance with this Article.\n12.   If an archipelagic State does not designate sea lanes or air routes, the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage may be exercised through the routes normally used for international navigation.\nArticle 54\nDuties of ships and aircraft during their passage, research and survey activities, duties of the archipelagic State and laws and regulations of the archipelagic State relating to archipelagic sea lanes passage\nArticles 39, 40, 42 and 44 apply mutatis mutandis to archipelagic sea lanes passage.\nPART V\nEXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE\nArticle 55\nSpecific legal regime of the exclusive economic zone\nThe exclusive economic zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in this part, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and freedoms of other States are governed by the relevant provisions of this Convention.\nArticle 56\nRights, jurisdiction and duties of the coastal State in the exclusive economic zone\n1.   In the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State has:\n(a)\nsovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the sea-bed and of the sea-bed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents and winds;\n(b)\njurisdiction as provided for in the relevant provisions of this Convention with regard to:\n(i)\nthe establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures;\n(ii)\nmarine scientific research;\n(iii)\nthe protection and preservation of the marine environment;\n(c)\nother rights and duties provided for in this Convention.\n2.   In exercising its rights and performing its duties under this Convention in the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State shall have due regard to the rights and duties of other States and shall act in a manner compatible with the provisions of this Convention.\n3.   The rights set out in this Article with respect to the sea-bed and subsoil shall be exercised in accordance with Part VI.\nArticle 57\nBreadth of the exclusive economic zone\nThe exclusive economic zone shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.\nArticle 58\nRights and duties of other States in the exclusive economic zone\n1.   In the exclusive economic zone, all States, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy, subject to the relevant provisions of this Convention, the freedoms referred to in Article 87 of navigation and overflight and of the laying of submarine cables and pipelines, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms, such as those associated with the operation of ships, aircraft and submarine cables and pipelines, and compatible with the other provisions of this Convention.\n2.   Articles 88 to 115 and other pertinent rules of international law apply to the exclusive economic zone in so far as they are not incompatible with this part.\n3.   In exercising their rights and performing their duties under this Convention in the exclusive economic zone, States shall have due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and shall comply with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of this Convention and other rules of international law in so far as they are not incompatible with this part.\nArticle 59\nBasis for the resolution of conflicts regarding the attribution of rights and jurisdiction in the exclusive economic zone\nIn cases where this Convention does not attribute rights or jurisdiction to the coastal State or to other States within the exclusive economic zone, and a conflict arises between the interests of the coastal State and any other State or States, the conflict should be resolved on the basis of equity and in the light of all the relevant circumstances, taking into account the respective importance of the interests involved to the parties as well as to the international community as a whole.\nArticle 60\nArtificial islands, installations and structures in the exclusive economic zone\n1.   In the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State shall have the exclusive right to construct and to authorise and regulate the construction, operation and use of:\n(a)\nartificial islands;\n(b)\ninstallations and structures for the purposes provided for in Article 56 and other economic purposes;\n(c)\ninstallations and structures which may interfere with the exercise of the rights of the coastal State in the zone.\n2.   The coastal State shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such artificial islands, installations and structures, including jurisdiction with regard to customs, fiscal, health, safety and immigration laws and regulations.\n3.   Due notice must be given of the construction of such artificial islands, installations or structures, and permanent means for giving warning of their presence must be maintained. Any installations or structures which are abandoned or disused shall be removed to ensure safety of navigation, taking into account any generally accepted international standards established in this regard by the competent international organisation. Such removal shall also have due regard to fishing, the protection of the marine environment and the rights and duties of other States. Appropriate publicity shall be given to the depth, position and dimensions of any installations or structures not entirely removed.\n4.   The coastal State may, where necessary, establish reasonable safety zones around such artificial islands, installations and structures in which it may take appropriate measures to ensure the safety both of navigation and of the artificial islands, installations and structures.\n5.   The breadth of the safety zones shall be determined by the coastal State, taking into account applicable international standards. Such zones shall be designed to ensure that they are reasonably related to the nature and function of the artificial islands, installations or structures, and shall not exceed a distance of 500 metres around them, measured from each point of their outer edge, except as authorised by generally accepted international standards or as recommended by the competent international organisation. Due notice shall be given of the extent of safety zones.\n6.   All ships must respect these safety zones and shall comply with generally accepted international standards regarding navigation in the vicinity of artificial islands, installations, structures and safety zones.\n7.   Artificial islands, installations and structures and the safety zones around them may not be established where interference may be caused to the use of recognised sea lanes essential to international navigation.\n8.   Artificial islands, installations and structures do not possess the status of islands. They have no territorial sea of their own, and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf.\nArticle 61\nConservation of the living resources\n1.   The coastal State shall determine the allowable catch of the living resources in its exclusive economic zone.\n2.   The coastal State, taking into account the best scientific evidence available to it, shall ensure through proper conservation and management measures that the maintenance of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone is not endangered by over-exploitation. As appropriate, the coastal State and competent international organisations, whether subregional, regional or global, shall cooperate to this end.\n3.   Such measures shall also be designed to maintain or restore populations of harvested species at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the economic needs of coastal fishing communities and the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global.\n4.   In taking such measures the coastal State shall take into consideration the effects on species associated with or dependent on harvested species with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such associated or dependent species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened.\n5.   Available scientific information, catch and fishing effort statistics, and other data relevant to the conservation to fish stocks shall be contributed and exchanged on a regular basis through competent international organisations, whether subregional, regional or global, where appropriate and with participation by all States concerned, including States whose nationals are allowed to fish in the exclusive economic zone.\nArticle 62\nUtilisation of the living resources\n1.   The coastal State shall promote the objective of optimum utilisation of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone without prejudice to Article 61.\n2.   The coastal State shall determine its capacity to harvest the living resources of the exclusive economic zone. Where the coastal State does not have the capacity to harvest the entire allowable catch, it shall, through agreements or other arrangements and pursuant to the terms, conditions, laws and regulations referred to in paragraph 4, give other States access to the surplus of the allowable catch, having particular regard to the provisions of Articles 69 and 70, especially in relation to the developing States mentioned therein.\n3.   In giving access to other States to its exclusive economic zone under this Article, the coastal State shall take into account all relevant factors, including, inter alia, the significance of the living resources of the area to the economy of the coastal State concerned and its other national interests, the provisions of Articles 69 and 70, the requirements of developing States in the subregion or region in harvesting part of the surplus and the need to minimise economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually fished in the zone or which have made substantial efforts in research and identification of stocks.\n4.   Nationals of other States fishing in the exclusive economic zone shall comply with the conservation measures and with the other terms and conditions established in the laws and regulations of the coastal State. These laws and regulations shall be consistent with, this Convention and may relate, inter alia, to the following:\n(a)\nlicensing of fishermen, fishing vessels and equipment, including payment of fees and other forms of remuneration, which, in the case of developing coastal States, may consist of adequate compensation in the field of financing, equipment and technology relating to the fishing industry;\n(b)\ndetermining the species which may be caught, and fixing quotas of catch, whether in relation to particular stocks or groups of stocks or catch per vessel over a period of time or to the catch by nationals of any State during a specified period;\n(c)\nregulating seasons and areas of fishing, the types, sizes and amount of gear, and the types, sizes and number of fishing vessels that may be used;\n(d)\nfixing the age and size of fish and other species that may be caught;\n(e)\nspecifying information required of fishing vessels, including catch and effort statistics and vessel position reports;\n(f)\nrequiring, under the authorisation and control of the coastal State, the conduct of specified fisheries research programmes and regulating the conduct of such research, including the sampling of catches, disposition of samples and reporting of associated scientific data;\n(g)\nthe placing of observers or trainees on board such vessels by the coastal State;\n(h)\nthe landing of all or any part of the catch by such vessels in the ports of the coastal State;\n(i)\nterms and conditions relating to joint ventures or other cooperative arrangements;\n(j)\nrequirements for the training of personnel and the transfer of fisheries technology, including enhancement of the coastal State's capability of undertaking fisheries research;\n(k)\nenforcement procedures.\n5.   Coastal States shall give due notice of conservation and management laws and regulations.\nArticle 63\nStocks occurring within the exclusive economic zones of two or more coastal States or both within the exclusive economic zone and in an area beyond and adjacent to it\n1.   Where the same stock or stocks of associated species occur within the exclusive economic zones of two or more coastal States, these States shall seek, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional organisations, to agree on the measures necessary to coordinate and ensure the conservation and development of such stocks without prejudice to the other provisions of this part.\n2.   Where the same stock or stocks of associated species occur both within the exclusive economic zone and in an area beyond and adjacent to the zone, the coastal State and the States fishing for such stocks in the adjacent area shall seek, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional organisations, to agree on the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent area.\nArticle 64\nHighly migratory species\n1.   The coastal State and other States whose nationals fish in the region for the highly migratory species listed in Annex I shall cooperate directly or through appropriate international organisations with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilisation of such species throughout the region, both within and beyond the exclusive economic zone. In regions for which no appropriate international organisation exists, the coastal State and other States whose nationals harvest these species in the region shall cooperate to establish such an organisation and participate in its work.\n2.   The provisions of paragraph 1 apply in addition to the other provisions of this part.\nArticle 65\nMarine mammals\nNothing in this part restricts the right of a coastal State or the competence of an international organisation, as appropriate, to prohibit, limit or regulate the exploitation of marine mammals more strictly than provided for in this part. States shall cooperate with a view to the conservation of marine mammals and in the case of cetaceans shall in particular work through the appropriate international organisations for their conservation, management and study.\nArticle 66\nAnadromous stocks\n1.   States in whose rivers anadromous stocks originate shall have the primary interest in and responsibility for such stocks.\n2.   The State of origin of anadromous stocks shall ensure their conservation by the establishment of appropriate regulatory measures for fishing in all waters landward of the outer limits of its exclusive economic zone and for fishing provided for in paragraph 3(b). The State of origin may, after consultations with the other States referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 fishing these stocks, establish total allowable catches for stocks originating in its rivers.\n3.\n(a)\nFisheries for anadromous stocks shall be conducted only in waters landward of the outer limits of exclusive economic zones, except in cases where this provision would result in economic dislocation for a State other than the State of origin. With respect to such fishing beyond the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone, States concerned shall maintain consultations with a view to achieving agreement on terms and conditions of such fishing giving due regard to the conservation requirements and the needs of the State of origin in respect of these stocks.\n(b)\nThe State of origin shall cooperate in minimising economic dislocation in such other States fishing these stocks, taking into account the normal catch and the mode of operations of such States, and all the areas in which such fishing has occurred.\n(c)\nStates referred to in subparagraph (b), participating by agreement with the State of origin in measures to renew anadromous stocks, particularly by expenditures for that purpose, shall be given special consideration by the State of origin in the harvesting of stocks originating in its rivers.\n(d)\nEnforcement of regulations regarding anadromous stocks beyond the exclusive economic zone shall be by agreement between the State of origin and the other States concerned.\n4.   In cases where anadromous stocks migrate into or through the waters landward of the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone of a State other than the State of origin, such State shall cooperate with the State of origin with regard to the conservation and management of such stocks.\n5.   The State of origin of anadromous stocks and other States fishing these stocks shall make arrangements for the implementation of the provisions of this Article, where appropriate, through regional organisations.\nArticle 67\nCatadromous species\n1.   A coastal State in whose waters catadromous species spend the greater part of their life cycle shall have responsibility for the management of these species and shall ensure the ingress and egress of migrating fish.\n2.   Harvesting of catadromous species shall be conducted only in waters landward of the outer limits of exclusive economic zones. When conducted in exclusive economic zones, harvesting shall be subject to this Article and the other provisions of this Convention concerning fishing in these zones.\n3.   In cases where catadromous fish migrate through the exclusive economic zone of another State, whether as juvenile or maturing fish, the management, including harvesting, of such fish shall be regulated by agreement between the State mentioned in paragraph 1 and the other State concerned. Such agreement shall ensure the rational management of the species and take into account the responsibilities of the State mentioned in paragraph 1 for the maintenance of these species.\nArticle 68\nSedentary species\nThis part does not apply to sedentary species as defined in Article 77(4).\nArticle 69\nRight of land-locked States\n1.   Land-locked States shall have the right to participate, on an equitable basis, in the exploitation of an appropriate part of the surplus of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the same subregion or region, taking into account the relevant economic and geographical circumstances of all the States concerned and in conformity with the provisions of this Article and of Articles 61 and 62.\n2.   The terms and modalities of such participation shall be established by the States concerned through bilateral, subregional or regional agreements taking into account, inter alia:\n(a)\nthe need to avoid effects detrimental to fishing communities or fishing industries of the coastal State;\n(b)\nthe extent to which the land-locked State, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, is participating or is entitled to participate under existing bilateral, subregional or regional agreements in the exploitation of living resources of the exclusive economic zones of other coastal States;\n(c)\nthe extent to which other land-locked States and geographically disadvantaged States are participating in the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zone of the coastal State and the consequent need to avoid a particular burden for any single coastal State or a part of it;\n(d)\nthe nutritional needs of the populations of the respective States.\n3.   When the harvesting capacity of a coastal State approaches a point which would enable it to harvest the entire allowable catch of the living resources in its exclusive economic zone, the coastal State and other States concerned shall cooperate in the establishment of equitable arrangements on a bilateral, subregional or regional basis to allow for participation of developing land-locked States of the same subregion or region in the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the subregion or region, as may be appropriate in the circumstances and on terms satisfactory to all parties. In the implementation of this provision the factors mentioned in paragraph 2 shall also be taken into account.\n4.   Developed land-locked States shall, under the provisions of this Article, be entitled to participate in the exploitation of living resources only in the exclusive economic zones of developed coastal States of the same subregion or region having regard to the extent to which the coastal State, in giving access to other States to the living resources of its exclusive economic zone, has taken into account the need to minimise detrimental effects on fishing communities and economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually fished in the zone.\n5.   The above provisions are without prejudice to arrangements agreed on in subregions or regions where the coastal States may grant to land-locked States of the same subregion or region equal or preferential rights for the exploitation of the living resources in the exclusive economic zones.\nArticle 70\nRight of geographically disadvantaged States\n1.   Geographically disadvantaged States shall have the right to participate, on an equitable basis, in the exploitation of an appropriate part of the surplus of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the same subregion or region, taking into account the relevant economic and geographical circumstances of all the States concerned and in conformity with the provisions of this Article and of Articles 61 and 62.\n2.   For the purposes of this part, ‘geographically disadvantaged States’ means coastal States, including States bordering enclosed or semi-enclosed seas, whose geographical situation makes them dependent on the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of other States in the subregion or region for adequate supplies of fish for the nutritional purposes of their populations or parts thereof, and coastal States which can claim no exclusive economic zones of their own.\n3.   The terms and modalities of such participation shall be established by the States concerned through bilateral, subregional or regional agreements taking into account, inter alia:\n(a)\nthe need to avoid effects detrimental to fishing communities or fishing industries of the coastal State;\n(b)\nthe extent to which the geographically disadvantaged State, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, is participating or is entitled to participate under existing bilateral, subregional or regional agreements in the exploitation of living resources of the exclusive economic zones of other coastal States;\n(c)\nthe extent to which other geographically disadvantaged States and landlocked States are participating in the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zone of the coastal State and the consequent need to avoid a particular burden for any single coastal State or a part of it;\n(d)\nthe nutritional needs of the populations of the respective States.\n4.   When the harvesting capacity of a coastal State approaches a point which would enable it to harvest the entire allowable catch of the living resources in its exclusive economic zone, the coastal State and other States concerned shall cooperate in the establishment of equitable arrangements on a bilateral, subregional or regional basis to allow for participation of developing geographically disadvantaged States of the same subregion or region in the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the subregion or region, as may be appropriate in the circumstances and on terms satisfactory to all parties. In the implementation of this provision the factors mentioned in paragraph 3 shall also be taken into account.\n5.   Developed geographically disadvantaged States shall, under the provisions of this Article, be entitled to participate in the exploitation of living resources only in the exclusive economic zones of developed coastal States of the same subregion or region having regard to the extent to which the coastal State, in giving access to other States to the living resources of its exclusive economic zone, has taken into account the need to minimise detrimental effects on fishing communities and economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually fished in the zone.\n6.   The above provisions are without prejudice to arrangements agreed on in subregions or regions where the coastal States may grant to geographically disadvantaged States of the same subregion or region equal or preferential rights for the exploitation of the living resources in the exclusive economic zones.\nArticle 71\nNon-applicability of Articles 69 and 70\nThe provisions of Articles 69 and 70 do not apply in the case of a coastal State whose economy is overwhelmingly dependent on the exploitation of the living resources of its exclusive economic zone.\nArticle 72\nRestrictions on transfer of rights\n1.   Rights provided under Articles 69 and 70 to exploit living resources shall not be directly or indirectly transferred to third States or their nationals by lease or licence, by establishing joint ventures or in any other manner which has the effect of such transfer unless otherwise agreed by the States concerned.\n2.   The foregoing provision does not preclude the States concerned from obtaining technical or financial assistance from third States or international organisations in order to facilitate the exercise of the rights pursuant to Articles 69 and 70, provided that it does not have the effect referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 73\nEnforcement of laws and regulations of the coastal State\n1.   The coastal State may, in the exercise of its sovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living resources in the exclusive economic zone, take such measures, including boarding, inspection, arrest and judicial proceedings, as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by it in conformity with this Convention.\n2.   Arrested vessels and their crews shall be promptly released on the posting of reasonable bond or other security.\n3.   Coastal State penalties for violations of fisheries laws and regulations in the exclusive economic zone may not include imprisonment, in the absence of agreements to the contrary by the States concerned, or any other form of corporal punishment.\n4.   In cases of arrest or detention of foreign vessels the coastal State shall promptly notify the flag State, through appropriate channels, of the action taken and of any penalties subsequently imposed.\nArticle 74\nDelimitation of the exclusive economic zone between States with opposite or adjacent coasts\n1.   The delimitation of the exclusive economic zone between States with opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected by agreement on the basis of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable solution.\n2.   If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, the States concerned shall resort to the procedures provided for in Part XV.\n3.   Pending agreement as provided for in paragraph 1, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature and, during this transitional period, not to jeopardise or hamper the reaching of the final agreement. Such arrangements shall be without prejudice to the final delimitation.\n4.   Where there is an agreement in force between the States concerned, questions relating to the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.\nArticle 75\nCharts and lists of geographical coordinates\n1.   Subject to this part, the outer limit lines of the exclusive economic zone and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with Article 74 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Where appropriate, lists of geographical coordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted for such outer limit lines or lines of delimitation.\n2.   The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical coordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nPART VI\nCONTINENTAL SHELF\nArticle 76\nDefinition of the continental shelf\n1.   The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance.\n2.   The continental shelf of a coastal State shall not extend beyond the limits provided for in paragraph 4 to 6.\n3.   The continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the land mass of the coastal State, and consists of the sea-bed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise. It does not include the deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.\n4.\n(a)\nFor the purposes of this Convention, the coastal State shall establish the outer edge of the continental margin wherever the margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, by either:\n(i)\na line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to the outermost fixed points at each of which the thickness of sedimentary rocks is at least 1 % of the shortest distance from such point to the foot of the continental slope; or\n(ii)\na line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to fixed points not more than 60 nautical miles from the foot of the continental slope.\n(b)\nIn the absence of evidence to the contrary, the foot of the continental slope shall be determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base.\n5.   The fixed points comprising the line of the outer limits of the continental shelf on the sea-bed, drawn in accordance with paragraph 4(a)(i) and (ii), either shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured or shall not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2 500 metre isobath, which is a line connecting the depth of 2 500 metres.\n6.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, on submarine ridges, the outer limit of the continental shelf shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. This paragraph does not apply to submarine elevations that are natural components of the continental margin, such as its plateaux, rises, caps, banks and spurs.\n7.   The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf, where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length, connecting fixed points, defined by coordinates of latitude and longitude.\n8.   Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation. The Commission shall make recommendations to coastal States on matters related to the establishment of the outer limits of their continental shelf. The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding.\n9.   The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations charts and relevant information, including geodetic datum, permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf. The Secretary-General shall give due publicity thereto.\n10.   The provisions of this Article are without prejudice to the question of delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts.\nArticle 77\nRights of the coastal State over the continental shelf\n1.   The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.\n2.   The rights referred to in paragraph 1 are exclusive in the sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities without the express consent of the coastal State.\n3.   The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express proclamation.\n4.   The natural resources referred to in this part consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the sea-bed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species, that is to say, organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the sea-bed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the sea-bed or the subsoil.\nArticle 78\nLegal status of the superjacent waters and air space and the rights and freedoms of other States\n1.   The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not affect the legal status of the superjacent waters or of the air space above those waters.\n2.   The exercise of the rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf must not infringe or result in any unjustifiable interference with navigation and other rights and freedoms of other States as provided for in this Convention.\nArticle 79\nSubmarine cables and pipelines on the continental shelf\n1.   All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the continental shelf, in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n2.   Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from pipelines, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables or pipelines.\n3.   The delineation of the course for the laying of such pipelines on the continental shelf is subject to the consent of the coastal State.\n4.   Nothing in this part affects the right of the coastal State to establish conditions for cables or pipelines entering its territory or territorial sea, or its jurisdiction over cables and pipelines constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction.\n5.   When laying submarine cables or pipelines, States shall have due regard to cables or pipelines already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables or pipelines shall not be prejudiced.\nArticle 80\nArtificial islands, installations and structures on the continental shelf\nArticle 60 applies mutatis mutandis to artificial islands, installations and structures on the continental shelf.\nArticle 81\nDrilling on the continental shelf\nThe coastal State shall have the exclusive right to authorise and regulate drilling on the continental shelf for all purposes.\nArticle 82\nPayments and contributions with respect to the exploitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles\n1.   The coastal State shall make payments or contributions in kind in respect of the exploitation of the non-living resources of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.\n2.   The payments and contributions shall be made annually with respect to all production at a site after the first five years of production at that site. For the sixth year, the rate of payment or contribution shall be 1 % of the value or volume of production at the site. The rate shall increase by 1 % for each subsequent year until the 12th year and shall remain at 7 % thereafter. Production does not include resources used in connection with exploitation.\n3.   A developing State which is a net importer of a mineral resource produced from its continental shelf is exempt from making such payments or contributions in respect of that mineral resource.\n4.   The payments or contributions shall be made through the Authority, which shall distribute them to State Parties to this Convention, on the basis of equitable sharing criteria, taking into account the interests and needs of developing States, particularly the least developed and the land-locked among them.\nArticle 83\nDelimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts\n1.   The delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected by agreement on the basis of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable solution.\n2.   If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, the States concerned shall resort to the procedures provided for in Part XV.\n3.   Pending agreement as provided for in paragraph 1, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature and, during this transitional period, not to jeopardise or hamper the reaching of the final agreement. Such arrangements shall be without prejudice to the final delimitation.\n4.   Where there is an agreement in force between the States concerned, questions relating to the delimitation of the continental shelf shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.\nArticle 84\nCharts and lists of geographical coordinates\n1.   Subject to this part, the outer limit lines of the continental shelf and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with Article 83 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Where appropriate, lists of geographical coordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted for such outer limit lines or lines of delimitation.\n2.   The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical coordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and, in the case of those showing the outer limit lines of the continental shelf, with the Secretary-General of the Authority.\nArticle 85\nTunnelling\nThis part does not prejudice the right of the coastal State to exploit the subsoil by means of tunnelling, irrespective of the depth of water above the subsoil.\nPART VII\nHIGH SEAS\nSECTION 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 86\nApplication of the provisions of this part\nThe provisions of this part apply to all parts of the sea that are not included in the exclusive economic zone, in the territorial sea or in the internal waters of a State, or in the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic State. This Article does not entail any abridgement of the freedoms enjoyed by all States in the exclusive economic zone in accordance with Article 58.\nArticle 87\nFreedom of the high seas\n1.   The high seas are open to all States, whether coastal or land-locked. Freedom of the high seas is exercised under the conditions laid down by this Convention and by other rules of international law. It comprises, inter alia, both for coastal and land-locked States:\n(a)\nfreedom of navigation;\n(b)\nfreedom of overflight;\n(c)\nfreedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines, subject to Part VI;\n(d)\nfreedom to construct artificial islands and other installations permitted under international law, subject to Part VI;\n(e)\nfreedom of fishing, subject to the conditions laid down in Section 2;\n(f)\nfreedom of scientific research, subject to Parts VI and XIII.\n2.   These freedoms shall be exercised by all States with due regard for the interests of other States in their exercise of the freedom of the high seas, and also with due regard for the rights under this Convention with respect to activities in the area.\nArticle 88\nReservation of the high seas for peaceful purposes\nThe high seas shall be reserved for peaceful purposes.\nArticle 89\nInvalidity of claims of sovereignty over the high seas\nNo State may validly purport to subject any part of the high seas to its sovereignty.\nArticle 90\nRight of navigation\nEvery State, whether coastal or land-locked, has the right to sail ships flying its flag on the high seas.\nArticle 91\nNationality of ships\n1.   Every State shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag. Ships have the nationality of the State whose flag they are entitled to fly. There must exist a genuine link between the State and the ship.\n2.   Every State shall issue to ships to which it has granted the right to fly its flag documents to that effect.\nArticle 92\nStatus of ships\n1.   Ships shall sail under the flag of one State only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in this Convention, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas. A ship may not change its flag during a voyage or while in a port of call, save in the case of a real transfer of ownership or change of registry.\n2.   A ship which sails under the flags of two or more States, using them according to convenience, may not claim any of the nationalities in question with respect to any other State, and may be assimilated to a ship without nationality.\nArticle 93\nShips flying the flag of the United Nations, its specialised agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency\nThe preceding Articles do not prejudice the question of ships employed on the official service of the United Nations, its specalised agencies or the International Atomic Energy Agency, flying the flag of the organisation.\nArticle 94\nDuties of the flag State\n1.   Every State shall effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag.\n2.   In particular every State shall:\n(a)\nmaintain a register of ships containing the names and particulars of ships flying its flag, except those which are excluded from generally accepted international regulations on account of their small size; and\n(b)\nassume jurisdiction under its internal law over each ship flying its flag and its master, officers and crew in respect of administrative, technical and social matters concerning the ship.\n3.   Every State shall take such measures for ships flying its flag as are necessary to ensure safety at sea with regard, inter alia, to:\n(a)\nthe construction, equipment and seaworthiness of ships;\n(b)\nthe manning of ships, labour conditions and the training of crews, taking into account the applicable international instruments;\n(c)\nthe use of signals, the maintenance of communications and the prevention of collisions.\n4.   Such measures shall include those necessary to ensure:\n(a)\nthat each ship, before registration and thereafter at appropriate intervals, is surveyed by a qualified surveyor of ships, and has on board such charts, nautical publications and navigational equipment and instruments as are appropriate for the safe navigation of the ship;\n(b)\nthat each ship is in the charge of a master and officers who possess appropriate qualifications, in particular in seamanship, navigation, communications and marine engineering, and that the crew is appropriate in qualification and numbers for the type, size, machinery and equipment of the ship;\n(c)\nthat the master, officers and, to the extent appropriate, the crew are fully conversant with and required to observe the applicable international regulations concerning the safety of life at sea, the prevention of collisions, the prevention, reduction and control of marine pollution, and the maintenance of communications by radio.\n5.   In taking the measures called for in paragraphs 3 and 4 each State is required to conform to generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices and to take any steps which may be necessary to secure their observance.\n6.   A State which has clear grounds to believe that proper jurisdiction and control with respect to a ship have not been exercised may report the facts to the flag State. On receiving such a report, the flag State shall investigate the matter and, if appropriate, take any action necessary to remedy the situation.\n7.   Each State shall cause an inquiry to be held by or before a suitably qualified person or persons into every marine casualty or incident of navigation on the high seas involving a ship flying its flag and causing loss of life or serious injury to nationals of another State or serious damage to ships or installations of another State or to the marine environment. The flag State and the other State shall cooperate in the conduct of any inquiry held by that other State into any such marine casualty or incident of navigation.\nArticle 95\nImmunity of warships on the high seas\nWarships on the high seas have complete immunity from the jurisdiction of any State other than the flag State.\nArticle 96\nImmunity of ships used only on government non-commercial service\nShips owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service shall, on the high seas, have complete immunity from the jurisdiction of any State other than the flag State.\nArticle 97\nPenal jurisdiction in matters of collision or any other incident of navigation\n1.   In the event of a collision or any other incident of navigation concerning a ship on the high seas, involving the penal or disciplinary responsibility of the master or of any other person in the service of the ship, no penal or disciplinary proceedings may be instituted against such person except before the judicial or administrative authorities either of the flag State or of the State of which such person is a national.\n2.   In disciplinary matters, the State which has issued a master's certificate or a certificate of competence or licence shall alone be competent, after due legal process, to pronounce the withdrawal of such certificates, even if the holder is not a national of the State which issued them.\n3.   No arrest or detention of the ship, even as a measure of investigation, shall be ordered by any authorities other than those of the flag State.\nArticle 98\nDuty to render assistance\n1.   Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the crew or the passengers:\n(a)\nto render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost;\n(b)\nto proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him;\n(c)\nafter a collision, to render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, where possible, to inform the other ship of the name of his own ship, its port of registry and the nearest port at which it will call.\n2.   Every coastal State shall promote the establishment, operation and maintenance of an adequate and effective search and rescue service regarding safety on and over the sea and, where circumstances so require, by way of mutual regional arrangements cooperate with neighbouring States for this purpose.\nArticle 99\nProhibition of the transport of slaves\nEvery State shall take effective measures to prevent and punish the transport of slaves in ships authorised to fly its flag and to prevent the unlawful use of its flag for that purpose. Any slave taking refuge on board any ship, whatever its flag, shall ipso facto be free.\nArticle 100\nDuty to cooperate in the repression of piracy\nAll States shall cooperate to the fullest possible extent in the repression of piracy on the high seas or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State.\nArticle 101\nDefinition of piracy\nPiracy consists of any of the following acts:\n(a)\nany illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed:\n(i)\non the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;\n(ii)\nagainst a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;\n(b)\nany act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;\n(c)\nany act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).\nArticle 102\nPiracy by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied\nThe acts of piracy, as defined in Article 101, committed by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship or aircraft are assimilated to acts committed by a private ship or aircraft.\nArticle 103\nDefinition of a pirate ship or aircraft\nA ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in Article 101. The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act.\nArticle 104\nRetention or loss of the nationality of a pirate ship or aircraft\nA ship or aircraft may retain its nationality although it has become a pirate ship or aircraft. The retention or loss of nationality is determined by the law of the State from which such nationality was derived.\nArticle 105\nSeizure of a pirate ship or aircraft\nOn the high seas, or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State, every State may seize a pirate ship or aircraft, or a ship or aircraft taken by piracy and under the control of pirates, and arrest the persons and seize the property on board. The courts of the State which carried out the seizure may decide on the penalties to be imposed, and may also determine the action to be taken with regard to the ships, aircraft or property, subject to the rights of third parties acting in good faith.\nArticle 106\nLiability for seizure without adequate grounds\nWhere the seizure of a ship or aircraft on suspicion of piracy has been effected without adequate grounds, the State making the seizure shall be liable to the State the nationality of which is possessed by the ship or aircraft for any loss or damage caused by the seizure.\nArticle 107\nShips and aircraft which are entitled to seize on account of piracy\nA seizure on account of piracy may be carried out only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorised to that effect.\nArticle 108\nIllicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances\n1.   All States shall cooperate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions.\n2.   Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic.\nArticle 109\nUnauthorised broadcasting from the high seas\n1.   All States shall cooperate in the suppression of unauthorised broadcasting from the high seas.\n2.   For the purposes of this Convention, ‘unauthorised broadcasting’ means the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls.\n3.   Any person engaged in unauthorised broadcasting may be prosecuted before the court of:\n(a)\nthe flag State of the ship;\n(b)\nthe State of registry of the installation;\n(c)\nthe State of which the person is a national;\n(d)\nany State where the transmissions can be received; or\n(e)\nany State where authorised radio communication is suffering interference.\n4.   On the high seas, a State having jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 3 may, in conformity with Article 110, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus.\nArticle 110\nRight of visit\n1.   Except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign ship, other than a ship entitled to complete immunity in accordance with Articles 95 and 96, is not justified in boarding it unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting that:\n(a)\nthe ship is engaged in piracy;\n(b)\nthe ship is engaged in the slave trade;\n(c)\nthe ship is engaged in unauthorised broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under Article 109;\n(d)\nthe ship is without nationality; or\n(e)\nthough flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship.\n2.   In the cases provided for in paragraph 1, the warship may proceed to verify the ship's right to fly its flag. To this end, it may send a boat under the command of an officer to the suspected ship. If suspicion remains after the documents have been checked, it may proceed to a further examination on board the ship, which must be carried out with all possible consideration.\n3.   If the suspicions prove to be unfounded, and provided that the ship boarded has not committed any act justifying them, it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been sustained.\n4.   These provisions apply mutatis mutandis to military aircraft.\n5.   These provisions also apply to any other duly authorised ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service.\nArticle 111\nRight of hot pursuit\n1.   The hot pursuit of a foreign ship may be undertaken when the competent authorities of the coastal State have good reason to believe that the ship has violated the laws and regulations of that State. Such pursuit must be commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal waters, the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea or the contiguous zone of the pursuing State, and may only be continued outside the territorial sea or the contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted. It is not necessary that, at the time when the foreign ship within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone receives the order to stop, the ship giving the order should likewise be within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone. If the foreign ship is within a contiguous zone, as defined in Article 33, the pursuit may only be undertaken if there has been a violation of the rights for the protection of which the zone was established.\n2.   The right of hot pursuit shall apply mutatis mutandis to violations in the exclusive economic zone or on the continental shelf, including safety zones around continental shelf installations, of the laws and regulations of the coastal State applicable in accordance with this Convention to the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf, including such safety zones.\n3.   The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State.\n4.   Hot pursuit is not deemed to have begun unless the pursuing ship has satisfied itself by such practicable means as may be available that the ship pursued or one of its boats or other craft working as a team and using the ship pursued as a mother ship is within the limits of the territorial sea, or, as the case may be, within the contiguous zone or the exclusive economic zone or above the continental shelf. The pursuit may only be commenced after a visual or auditory signal to stop has been given at a distance which enables it to be seen or heard by the foreign ship.\n5.   The right of hot pursuit may be exercised only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorised to that effect.\n6.   Where hot pursuit is effected by an aircraft:\n(a)\nthe provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis;\n(b)\nthe aircraft giving the order to stop must itself actively pursue the ship until a ship or another aircraft of the coastal State, summoned by the aircraft, arrives to take over the pursuit, unless the aircraft is itself able to arrest the ship. It does not suffice to justify an arrest outside the territorial sea that the ship was merely sighted by the aircraft as an offender or suspected offender, if it was not both ordered to stop and pursued by the aircraft itself or other aircraft or ships which continue the pursuit without interruption.\n7.   The release of a ship arrested within the jurisdiction of a State and escorted to a port of that State for the purposes of an inquiry before the competent authorities may not be claimed solely on the ground that the ship, in the course of its voyage, was escorted across a portion of the exclusive economic zone or the high seas, if the circumstances rendered this necessary.\n8.   Where a ship has been stopped or arrested outside the territorial sea in circumstances which do not justify the exercise of the right of hot pursuit, it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been thereby sustained.\nArticle 112\nRight to lay submarine cables and pipelines\n1.   All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the bed of the high seas beyond the continental shelf.\n2.   Article 79(5) applies to such cables and pipelines.\nArticle 113\nBreaking or injury of a submarine cable or pipeline\nEvery State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that the breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction of a submarine cable beneath the high seas done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications, and similarly the breaking or injury of a submarine pipeline or high-voltage power cable, shall be a punishable offence. This provision shall apply also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury. However, it shall not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury.\nArticle 114\nBreaking or injury by owners of a submarine cable or pipeline of another submarine cable or pipeline\nEvery State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable or pipeline beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable or pipeline, cause a break in or injury to another cable or pipeline, they shall bear the cost of the repairs.\nArticle 115\nIndemnity for loss incurred in avoiding injury to a submarine cable or pipeline\nEvery State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable or pipeline, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable or pipeline, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.\nSECTION 2\nCONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE HIGH SEAS\nArticle 116\nRight to fish on the high seas\nAll States have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas subject to:\n(a)\ntheir Treaty obligations;\n(b)\nthe rights and duties as well as the interests of coastal States provided for, inter alia, in Article 63(2) and Articles 64 to 67; and\n(c)\nthe provisions of this section.\nArticle 117\nDuty of States to adopt with respect to their nationals measures for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas\nAll States have the duty to take, or to cooperate with other States in taking, such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas.\nArticle 118\nCooperation of States in the conservation and management of living resources\nStates shall cooperate with each other in the conservation and management of living resources in the areas of the high seas. States whose nationals exploit identical living resources, or different living resources in the same area, shall enter into negotiations with a view to taking the measures necessary for the conservation of the living resources concerned. They shall, as appropriate, cooperate to establish subregional or regional fisheries organisations to this end.\nArticle 119\nConservation of the living resources of the high seas\n1.   In determining the allowable catch and establishing other conservation measures for the living resources in the high seas, States shall:\n(a)\ntake measures which are designed, on the best scientific evidence available to the States concerned, to maintain or restore populations of harvested species at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global;\n(b)\ntake into consideration the effects on species associated with or dependent on harvested species with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such associated or dependent species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened.\n2.   Available scientific information, catch and fishing effort statistics, and other data relevant to the conservation of fish stocks shall be contributed and exchanged on a regular basis through competent international organisations, whether subregional, regional or global, where appropriate and with participation by all States concerned.\n3.   States concerned shall ensure that conservation measures and their implementation do not discriminate in form or in fact against the fishermen of any State.\nArticle 120\nMarine mammals\nArticle 65 also applies to the conservation and management of marine mammals in the high seas.\nPART VIII\nREGIME OF ISLANDS\nArticle 121\nRegime of islands\n1.   An island is a naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide.\n2.   Except as provided for in paragraph 3, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of an island are determined in accordance with the provisions of this Convention applicable to other land territory.\n3.   Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\nPART IX\nENCLOSED OR SEMI-ENCLOSED SEAS\nArticle 122\nDefinition\nFor the purposes of this Convention, ‘enclosed or semi-enclosed sea’ means a gulf, basin or sea surrounded by two or more States and connected to another sea or the ocean by a narrow outlet or consisting entirely or primarily of the territorial seas and exclusive economic zones of two or more coastal States.\nArticle 123\nCooperation of States bordering enclosed or semi-enclosed seas\nStates bordering an enclosed or semi-enclosed sea should cooperate with each other in the exercise of their rights and in the performance of their duties under this Convention. To this end they shall endeavour, directly or through an appropriate regional organisation:\n(a)\nto coordinate the management, conservation, exploration and exploitation of the living resources of the sea;\n(b)\nto coordinate the implementation of their rights and duties with respect to the protection and preservation of the marine environment;\n(c)\nto coordinate their scientific research policies and undertake where appropriate joint programmes of scientific research in the area;\n(d)\nto invite, as appropriate, other interested States or international organisations to cooperate with them in furtherance of the provisions of this Article.\nPART X\nRIGHT OF ACCESS OF LAND-LOCKED STATES TO AND FROM THE SEA AND FREEDOM OF TRANSIT\nArticle 124\nUse of terms\n1.   For the purposes of this Convention:\n(a)\n‘land-locked State’ means a State which has no sea-coast;\n(b)\n‘transit State’ means a State, with or without a sea-coast, situated between a land-locked State and the sea, through whose territory traffic in transit passes;\n(c)\n‘traffic in transit’ means transit of persons, baggage, goods and means of transport across the territory of one or more transit States, when the passage across such territory, with or without trans-shipment, warehousing, breaking bulk or change in the mode of transport, is only a portion of a complete journey which begins or terminates within the territory of the land-locked State;\n(d)\n‘means of transport’ means:\n(i)\nrailway rolling stock, sea, lake and river craft and road vehicles;\n(ii)\nwhere local conditions so require, porters and pack animals.\n2.   Land-locked States and transit States may, by agreement between them, include as means of transport pipelines and gas lines and means of transport other than those included in paragraph 1.\nArticle 125\nRight of access to and from the sea and freedom of transit\n1.   Land-locked States shall have the right of access to and from the sea for the purpose of exercising the rights provided for in this Convention including those relating to the freedom of the high seas and the common heritage of mankind. To this end, land-locked States shall enjoy freedom of transit through the territory of transit States by all means of transport.\n2.   The terms and modalities for exercising freedom of transit shall be agreed between the land-locked States and transit States concerned through bilateral, subregional or regional agreements.\n3.   Transit States, in the exercise of their full sovereignty over their territory, shall have the right to take all measures necessary to ensure that the rights and facilities provided for in this part for land-locked States shall in no way infringe their legitimate interests.\nArticle 126\nExclusion of application of the most-favoured-nation clause\nThe provisions of this Convention, as well as special agreements relating to the exercise of the right of access to and from the sea, establishing rights and facilities on account of the special geographical position of land-locked States, are excluded from the application of the most-favoured-nation clause.\nArticle 127\nCustoms duties, taxes and other charges\n1.   Traffic in transit shall not be subject to any customs duties, taxes or other charges except charges levied for specific services rendered in connection with such traffic.\n2.

All States Parties shall cooperate to this end.\n(b)\nThe Authority shall have the right to participate in any commodity conference dealing with those commodities and in which all interested parties including both producers and consumers participate. The Authority shall have the right to become a party to any arrangement or agreement resulting from such conferences. Participation of the Authority in any organs established under those arrangements or agreements shall be in respect of production in the area and in accordance with the relevant rules of those organs.\n(c)\nThe Authority shall carry out its obligations under the arrangements or agreements referred to in this paragraph in a manner which assures a uniform and non-discriminatory implementation in respect of all production in the area of the minerals concerned. In doing so, the Authority shall act in a manner consistent with the terms of existing contracts and approved plans of work of the enterprise.\n2.\n(a)\nDuring the interim period specified in paragraph 3, commercial production shall not be undertaken pursuant to an approved plan of work until the operator has applied for and has been issued a production authorisation by the Authority. Such production authorisations may not be applied for or issued more than five years prior to the planned commencement of commercial production under the plan of work unless, having regard to the nature and timing of project development, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority prescribe another period.\n(b)\nIn the application for the production authorisation, the operator shall specify the annual quantity of nickel expected to be recovered under the approved plan of work. The application shall include a schedule of expenditures to be made by the operator after he has received the authorisation which are reasonably calculated to allow him to begin commercial production on the date planned.\n(c)\nFor the purposes of subparagraphs (a) and (b), the Authority shall establish appropriate performance requirements in accordance with Annex III, Article 17.\n(d)\nThe Authority shall issue a production authorisation for the level of production applied for unless the sum of that level and the levels already authorised exceeds the nickel production ceiling, as calculated pursuant to paragraph 4 in the year of issuance of the authorisation, during any year of planned production falling within the interim period.\n(e)\nWhen issued, the production authorisation and approved application shall become a part of the approved plan of work.\n(f)\nIf the operator's application for a production authorisation is denied pursuant to subparagraph (d), the operator may apply again to the Authority at any time.\n3.   The interim period shall begin five years prior to 1 January of the year in which the earliest commercial production is planned to commence under an approved plan of work. If the earliest commercial production is delayed beyond the year originally planned, the beginning of the interim period and the production ceiling originally calculated shall be adjusted accordingly. The interim period shall last 25 years or until the end of the review Conference referred to in Article 155 or until the day when such new arrangements or agreements as are referred to in paragraph 1 enter into force, whichever is earliest. The Authority shall resume the power provided in this Article for the remainder of the interim period if the said arrangements or agreements should lapse or become ineffective for any reason whatsoever.\n4.\n(a)\nThe production ceiling for any year of the interim period shall be the sum of:\n(i)\nthe difference between the trend line values for nickel consumption, as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b), for the year immediately prior to the year of the earliest commercial production and the year immediately prior to the commencement of the interim period; and\n(ii)\n60 % of the difference between the trend line values for nickel consumption, as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b), for the year for which the production authorisation is being applied for and the year immediately prior to the year of the earliest commercial production.\n(b)\nFor the purposes of subparagraph (a):\n(i)\ntrend line values used for computing the nickel production ceiling shall be those annual nickel consumption values on a trend line computed during the year in which a production authorisation is issued. The trend line shall be derived from a linear regression of the logarithms of actual nickel consumption for the most recent 15-year period for which such data are available, time being the independent variable. This trend line shall be referred to as the original trend line;\n(ii)\nif the annual rate of increase of the original trend line is less than 3 %, then the trend line used to determine the quantities referred to in subparagraph (a) shall instead be one passing through the original trend line at the value of the first year of the relevant 15-year period, and increasing at 3 % annually; provided however that the production ceiling established for any year of the interim period does not in any case exceed the difference between the original trend line value for that year and the original trend line value for the year immediately prior to the commencement of the interim period.\n5.   The Authority shall reserve to the enterprise for its initial production a quantity of 38 000 tonnes of nickel from the available production ceiling calculated pursuant to paragraph 4.\n6.\n(a)\nAn operator may in any year produce less than or up to 8 % more than the level of annual production of minerals from polymetallic nodules specified in his production authorisation, provided that the overall amount of production shall not exceed that specified in the authorisation. Any excess over 8 % and up to 20 % in any year, or any excess in the first and subsequent years following two consecutive years in which excesses occur, shall be negotiated with the Authority, which may require the operator to obtain a supplementary production authorisation to cover additional production.\n(b)\nApplications for such supplementary production authorisations shall be considered by the Authority only after all pending applications by operators who have not yet received production authorisations have been acted on and due account has been taken of other likely applicants. The Authority shall be guided by the principle of not exceeding the total production allowed under the production ceiling in any year of the interim period. It shall not authorise the production under any plan of work of a quantity in excess of 46 500 tonnes of nickel per year.\n7.   The levels of production of other metals such as copper, cobalt and manganese extracted from the polymetallic nodules that are recovered pursuant to a production authorisation should not be higher than those which would have been produced had the operator produced the maximum level of nickel from those nodules pursuant to this Article. The Authority shall establish rules, regulations and procedures pursuant to Annex III, Article 17, to implement this paragraph.\n8.   Rights and obligations relating to unfair economic practices under relevant multilateral trade agreements shall apply to the exploration for and exploitation of minerals from the area. In the settlement of disputes arising under this provision, States Parties which are parties to such multilateral trade agreements shall have recourse to the dispute settlement procedures of such agreements.\n9.   The Authority shall have the power to limit the level of production of minerals from the area, other than minerals from polymetallic nodules, under such conditions and applying such methods as may be appropriate by adopting regulations in accordance with Article 161(8).\n10.   On the recommendation of the Council on the basis of advice from the Economic Planning Commission, the Assembly shall establish a system of compensation or take other measures of economic adjustment assistance including cooperation with specialised agencies and other international organisations to assist developing countries which suffer serious adverse effects on their export earnings or economies resulting from a reduction in the price of an affected mineral or in the volume of exports of that mineral, to the extent that such reduction is caused by activities in the area. The Authority on request shall initiate studies on the problems of those States which are likely to be most seriously affected with a view to minimising their difficulties and assisting them in their economic adjustment.\nArticle 152\nExercise of powers and functions by the Authority\n1.   The Authority shall avoid discrimination in the exercise of its powers and functions, including the granting of opportunities for activities in the area.\n2.   Nevertheless, special consideration for developing States, including particular consideration for the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged among them, specifically provided for in this part shall be permitted.\nArticle 153\nSystem of exploration and exploitation\n1.   Activities in the area shall be organised, carried out and controlled by the Authority on behalf of mankind as a whole in accordance with this Article as well as other relevant provisions of this part and the relevant Annexes, and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.\n2.

Activities in the area shall be carried out in accordance with a formal written plan of work drawn up in accordance with Annex III and approved by the Council after review by the Legal and Technical Commission. In the case of activities in the area carried out as authorised by the Authority by the entities specified in paragraph 2(b), the plan of work shall, in accordance with Annex III, Article 3, be in the form of a contract. Such contracts may provide for joint arrangements in accordance with Annex III, Article 11.\n4.   The Authority shall exercise such control over activities in the area as is necessary for the purpose of securing compliance with the relevant provisions of this part and the Annexes relating thereto, and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, and the plans of work approved in accordance with paragraph 3. States Parties shall assist the Authority by taking all measures necessary to ensure such compliance in accordance with Article 139.\n5.   The Authority shall have the right to take at any time any measures provided for under this part to ensure compliance with its provisions and the exercise of the functions of control and regulation assigned to it thereunder or under any contract. The Authority shall have the right to inspect all installations in the area used in connection with activities in the area.\n6.   A contract under paragraph 3 shall provide for security of tenure. Accordingly, the contract shall not be revised, suspended or terminated except in accordance with Annex III, Articles 18 and 19.\nArticle 154\nPeriodic review\nEvery five years from the entry into force of this Convention, the Assembly shall undertake a general and systematic review of the manner in which the international regime of the area established in this Convention has operated in practice. In the light of this review the Assembly may take, or recommend that other organs take, measures in accordance with the provisions and procedures of this part and the Annexes relating thereto which will lead to the improvement of the operation of the regime.\nArticle 155\nThe Review Conference\n1.   Fifteen years from 1 January of the year in which the earliest commercial production commences under an approved plan of work, the Assembly shall convene a conference for the review of those provisions of this part and the relevant Annexes which govern the system of exploration and exploitation of the resources of the area. The Review Conference shall consider in detail, in the light of the experience acquired during that period:\n(a)\nwhether the provisions of this part which govern the system of exploration and exploitation of the resources of the area have achieved their aims in all respects, including whether they have benefited mankind as a whole;\n(b)\nwhether, during the 15-year period, reserved areas have been exploited in an effective and balanced manner in comparison with non-reserved areas;\n(c)\nwhether the development and use of the area and its resources have been undertaken in such a manner as to foster healthy development of the world economy and balanced growth of international trade;\n(d)\nwhether monopolisation of activities in the area has been prevented;\n(e)\nwhether the policies set forth in Articles 150 and 151 have been fulfilled; and\n(f)\nwhether the system has resulted in the equitable sharing of benefits derived from activities in the area, taking into particular consideration the interests and needs of the developing States.\n2.   The Review Conference shall ensure the maintenance of the principle of the common heritage of mankind, the international regime designed to ensure equitable exploitation of the resources of the area for the benefit of all countries, especially the developing States, and an Authority to organise, conduct and control activities in the area. It shall also ensure the maintenance of the principles laid down in this part with regard to the exclusion of claims or exercise of sovereignty over any part of the area, the rights of States and their general conduct in relation to the area, and their participation in activities in the area in conformity with this Convention, the prevention of monopolisation of activities in the area, the use of the area exclusively for peaceful purposes, economic aspects of activities in the area, marine scientific research, transfer of technology, protection of the marine environment, protection of human life, rights of coastal States, the legal status of the waters superjacent to the area and that of the air space above those waters and accommodation between activities in the area and other activities in the marine environment.\n3.   The decision-making procedure applicable at the Review Conference shall be the same as that applicable at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The Conference shall make every effort to reach agreement on any amendments by way of consensus and there should be no voting on such matters until all efforts at achieving consensus have been exhausted.\n4.   If, five years after its commencement, the Review Conference has not reached agreement on the system of exploration and exploitation of the resources of the area, it may decide during the ensuing 12 months, by a three-fourths majority of the States Parties, to adopt and submit to the States Parties for ratification or accession such amendments changing or modifying the system as it determines necessary and appropriate. Such amendments shall enter into force for all States Parties 12 months after the deposit of instruments of ratification or accession by three fourths of the States Parties.\n5.   Amendments adopted by the Review Conference pursuant to this Article shall not affect rights acquired under existing contracts.\nSECTION 4\nTHE AUTHORITY\nSubsection A\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 156\nEstablishment of the Authority\n1.

No State shall be obliged by virtue of this Article to institute proceedings when another State has already instituted proceedings in accordance with this Article.\nArticle 217\nEnforcement by flag States\n 1.    States shall ensure compliance by vessels flying their flag or of their registry with applicable international rules and standards, established through the competent international organisation or general diplomatic conference, and with their laws and regulations adopted in accordance with this Convention for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment from vessels and shall accordingly adopt laws and regulations and take other measures necessary for their implementation. Flag States shall provide for the effective enforcement of such rules, standards, laws and regulations, irrespective of where a violation occurs.\n2.   States shall, in particular, take appropriate measures in order to ensure that vessels flying their flag or of their registry are prohibited from sailing, until they can proceed to sea in compliance with the requirements of the international rules and standards referred to in paragraph 1, including requirements in respect of design, construction, equipment and manning of vessels.\n3.   States shall ensure that vessels flying their flag or of their registry carry on board certificates required by and issued pursuant to international rules and standards referred to in paragraph 1. States shall ensure that vessels flying their flag are periodically inspected in order to verify that such certificates are in conformity with the actual condition of the vessels. These certificates shall be accepted by other States as evidence of the condition of the vessels and shall be regarded as having the same force as certificates issued by them, unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the vessel does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificates.\n4.   If a vessel commits a violation of rules and standards established through the competent international organisation or general diplomatic conference, the flag State, without prejudice to Articles 218, 220 and 228, shall provide for immediate investigation and where appropriate institute proceedings in respect of the alleged violation irrespective of where the violation occurred or where the pollution caused by such violation has occurred or has been spotted.\n5.   Flag States conducting an investigation of the violation may request the assistance of any other State whose cooperation could be useful in clarifying the circumstances of the case. States shall endeavour to meet appropriate requests of flag States.\n6.   States shall, at the written request of any State, investigate any violation alleged to have been committed by vessels flying their flag. If satisfied that sufficient evidence is available to enable proceedings to be brought in respect of the alleged violation, flag States shall without delay institute such proceedings in accordance with their laws.\n7.   Flag States shall promptly inform the requesting State and the competent international organisation of the action taken and its outcome. Such information shall be available to all States.\n8.   Penalties provided for by the laws and regulations of States for vessels flying their flag shall be adequate in severity to discourage violations wherever they occur.\nArticle 218\nEnforcement by port States\n1.   When a vessel is voluntarily within a port or at an off-shore terminal of a State, that State may undertake investigations and, where the evidence so warrants, institute proceedings in respect of any discharge from that vessel outside the internal waters, territorial sea or exclusive economic zone of that State in violation of applicable international rules and standards established through the competent international organisation or general diplomatic conference.\n2.   No proceedings pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be instituted in respect of a discharge violation in the internal waters, territorial sea or exclusive economic zone of another State unless requested by that State, the flag State, or a State damaged or threatened by the discharge violation, or unless the violation has caused or is likely to cause pollution in the internal waters, territorial sea or exclusive economic zone of the State instituting the proceedings.\n3.   When a vessel is voluntarily within a port or at an off-shore terminal of a State, that State shall, as far as practicable, comply with requests from any State for investigation of a discharge violation referred to in paragraph 1, believed to have occurred in, caused, or threatened damage to the internal waters, territorial sea or exclusive economic zone of the requesting State. It shall likewise, as far as practicable, comply with requests from the flag State for investigation of such a violation, irrespective of where the violation occurred.\n4.   The records of the investigation carried out by a port State pursuant to this article shall be transmitted upon request to the flag State or to the coastal State. Any proceedings instituted by the port State on the basis of such an investigation may, subject so Section 7, be suspended at the request of the coastal State when the violation has occurred within its internal waters, territorial sea or exclusive economic zone. The evidence and records of the case, together with any bond or other financial security posted with the authorities of the port State, shall in that event be transmitted to the coastal State. Such transmittal shall preclude the continuation of proceedings in the port State.\nArticle 219\nMeasures relating to seaworthiness of vessels to avoid pollution\nSubject to Section 7, States which, on request or on their own initiative, have ascertained that a vessel within one of their ports or at one of their off-shore terminals is in violation of applicable international rules and standards relating to seaworthiness of vessels and thereby threatens damage to the marine environment shall, as far as practicable, take administrative measures to prevent the vessel from sailing. Such States may permit the vessel to proceed only to the nearest appropriate repair yard and, on removal of the causes of the violation, shall permit the vessel to continue immediately.\nArticle 220\nEnforcement by coastal States\n1.   When a vessel is voluntarily within a port or at an off-shore terminal of a State, that State may, subject to Section 7, institute proceedings in respect of any violation of its laws and regulations adopted in accordance with this Convention or applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels when the violation has occurred within the territorial sea or the exclusive economic zone of that State.\n2.   Where there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel navigating in the territorial sea of a State has, during its passage therein, violated laws and regulations of that State adopted in accordance with this Convention or applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels, that State, without prejudice to the application of the relevant provisions of part II, Section 3, may undertake physical inspection of the vessel relating to the violation and may, where the evidence so warrants, institute proceedings, including detention of the vessel, in accordance with its laws, subject to the provisions of Section 7.\n3.   Where there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel navigating in the exclusive economic zone or the territorial sea of a State has, in the exclusive economic zone, committed a violation of applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels or laws and regulations of that State conforming and giving effect to such rules and standards, that State may require the vessel to give information regarding its identity and port of registry, its last and its next port of call and other relevant information required to establish whether a violation has occurred.\n4.   States shall adopt laws and regulations and take other measures so that vessels flying their flag comply with requests for information pursuant to paragraph 3.\n5.   Where there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel navigating in the exclusive economic zone or the territorial sea of a State has, in the exclusive economic zone, committed a violation referred to in paragraph 3 resulting in a substantial discharge causing or threatening significant pollution of the marine environment, that State may undertake physical inspection of the vessel for matters relating to the violation if the vessel has refused to give information or if the information supplied by the vessel is manifestly at variance with the evident factual situation and if the circumstances of the case justify such inspection.\n6.   Where there is clear objective evidence that a vessel navigating in the exclusive economic zone or the territorial sea of a State has, in the exclusive economic zone, committed a violation referred to in paragraph 3 resulting in a discharge causing major damage or threat of major damage to the coastline or related interests of the coastal State, or to any resources of its territorial sea or exclusive economic zone, that State may, subject to Section 7, provided that the evidence so warrants, institute proceedings, including detention of the vessel, in accordance with its laws.\n7.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 6, whenever appropriate procedures have been established, either through the competent international organisation or as otherwise agreed, whereby compliance with requirements for bonding or other appropriate financial security has been assured, the coastal State if bound by such procedures shall allow the vessel to proceed.\n8.   The provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 also apply in respect of national laws and regulations adopted pursuant to Article 211(6).\nArticle 221\nMeasures to avoid pollution arising from maritime casualties\n1.   Nothing in this part shall prejudice the right of States, pursuant to international law, both customary and conventional, to take and enforce measures beyond the territorial sea proportionate to the actual or threatened damage to protect their coastline or related interests, including fishing, from pollution or threat of pollution following a maritime casualty or acts relating to such a casualty, which may reasonably be expected to result in major harmful consequences.\n2.

The Commission shall consist of 21 members who shall be experts in the field of geology, geophysics or hydrography, elected by States Parties to this Convention from among their nationals, having due regard to the need to ensure equitable geographical representation, who shall serve in their personal capacities.\n2.   The initial election shall be held as soon as possible but in any case within 18 months after the date of entry into force of this Convention. At least three months before the date of each election, the Secretary-General of the United Nations shall address a letter to the States Parties, inviting the submission of nominations, after appropriate regional consultations, within three months. The Secretary-General shall prepare a list in alphabetical order of all persons thus nominated and shall submit it to all the States Parties.\n3.   Elections of the members of the Commission shall be held at a meeting of States Parties convened by the Secretary-General at United Nations Headquarters. At that meeting, for which two thirds of the States Parties shall constitute a quorum, the persons elected to the Commission shall be those nominees who obtain a two-thirds majority of the votes of the representatives of States Parties present and voting. Not less than three members shall be elected from each geographical region.\n4.   The members of the Commission shall be elected for a term of five years. They shall be eligible for re-election.\n5.   The State Party which submitted the nomination of a member of the Commission shall defray the expenses of that member while in performance of Commission duties. The coastal State concerned shall defray the expenses incurred in respect of the advice referred to in Article 3(1 )(b), of this Annex. The secretariat of the Commission shall be provided by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nArticle 3\n1.   The functions of the Commission shall be:\n(a)\nto consider the data and other material submitted by coastal States concerning the outer limits of the continental shelf in areas where those limits extend beyond 200 nautical miles, and to make recommendations in accordance with Article 76 and the Statement of Understanding adopted on 29 August 1980 by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea;\n(b)\nto provide scientific and technical advice, if requested by the coastal State concerned during the preparation of the data referred to in subparagraph (a).\n2.   The Commission may cooperate, to the extent considered necessary and useful, with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of Unesco, the International Hydrographic Organisation and other competent international organisations with a view to exchanging scientific and technical information which might be of assistance in discharging the Commission's responsibilities.\nArticle 4\nWhere a coastal State intends to establish, in accordance with Article 76, the outer limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, it shall submit particulars of such limits to the Commission along with supporting scientific and technical data as soon as possible but in any case within 10 years of the entry into force of this Convention for that State. The coastal State shall at the same time give the names of any Commission members who have provided it with scientific and technical advice.\nArticle 5\nUnless the Commission decides otherwise, the Commission shall function by way of sub-commissions composed of seven members, appointed in a balanced manner taking into account the specific elements of each submission by a coastal State. Nationals of the coastal State making the submission who are members of the Commission and any Commission member who has assisted a coastal State by providing scientific and technical advice with respect to the delineation shall not be a member of the sub-commission dealing with that submission but has the right to participate as a member in the proceedings of the Commission concerning the said submission. The coastal State which has made a submission to the Commission may send its representatives to participate in the relevant proceedings without the right to vote.\nArticle 6\n1.   The sub-commission shall submit its recommendations to the Commission.\n2.   Approval by the Commission of the recommendations of the sub-commission shall be by a majority of two thirds of Commission members present and voting.\n3.   The recommendations of the Commission shall be submitted in writing to the coastal State which made the submission and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nArticle 7\nCoastal States shall establish the outer limits of the continental shelf in conformity with the provisions of Article 76(8), and in accordance with the appropriate nation procedures.\nArticle 8\nIn the case of disagreement by the coastal State with the recommendation of the Commission, the coastal State shall, within a reasonable time, make a revised or new submission to the Commission.\nArticle 9\nThe actions of the Commission shall not prejudice matters relating to delimitation of boundaries between States with opposite or adjacent coasts.\nANNEX III\nBASIC CONDITIONS OF PROSPECTING, EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION\nArticle 1\nTitle to minerals\nTitle to minerals shall pass on recovery in accordance with this Convention.\nArticle 2\nProspecting\n1.\n(a)\nThe Authority shall encourage prospecting in the area.\n(b)\nProspecting shall be conducted only after the Authority has received a satisfactory written undertaking that the proposed prospector will comply with this Convention and the relevant rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority concerning cooperation in the training programmes referred to in Articles 143 and 144 and the protection of the marine environment, and will accept verification by the Authority of compliance therewith. The proposed prospector shall, at the same time, notify the Authority of the approximate area or areas in which prospecting is to be conducted.\n(c)\nProspecting may be conducted simultaneously by more than one prospector in the same area or areas.\n2.   Prospecting shall not confer on the prospector any rights with respect to resources. A prospector may, however, recover a reasonable quantity of minerals to be used for testing.\nArticle 3\nExploration and exploitation\n1.   The enterprise, States Parties, and the other entities referred to in Article 153(2)(b) may apply to the Authority for approval of plans of work for activities in the area.\n2.   The enterprise may apply with respect to any part of the area, but applications by others with respect to reserved areas are subject to the additional requirements of Article 9 of this Annex.\n3.   Exploration and exploitation shall be carried out only in areas specified in plans of work referred to in Article 153(3) and approved by the Authority in accordance with this Convention and the relevant rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.\n4.   Every approved plan of work shall:\n(a)\nbe in conformity with this Convention and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority;\n(b)\nprovide for control by the Authority of activities in the area in accordance with Article 153(4);\n(c)\nconfer on the operator, in accordance with the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, the exclusive right to explore for and exploit the specified categories of resources in the area covered by the plan of work. If, however, the applicant presents for approval a plan of work covering only the stage of exploration or the stage of exploitation, the approved plan of work shall confer such exclusive right with respect to that stage only.\n5.   On its approval by the Authority, every plan of work, except those presented by the enterprise, shall be in the form of a contract concluded between the Authority and the applicant or applicants.\nArticle 4\nQualifications of applicants\n1.   Applicants, other than the enterprise, shall be qualified if they have the nationality or control and sponsorship required by Article 153(2)(b), and if they follow the procedures and meet the qualification standards set forth in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.\n2.   Except as provided in paragraph 6, such qualification standards shall relate to the financial and technical capabilities of the applicant and his performance under any previous contracts with the Authority.\n3.   Each applicant shall be sponsored by the State Party of which it is a national unless the applicant has more than one nationality, as in the case of a partnership or consortium of entities from several States, in which event all States Parties involved shall sponsor the application, or unless the applicant is effectively controlled by another State Party or its nationals, in which event both States Parties shall sponsor the application. The criteria and procedures for implementation of the sponsorship requirements shall be set forth in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.\n4.   The sponsoring State or States shall, pursuant to Article 139, have the responsibility to ensure, within their legal system, that a contractor so sponsored shall carry out activities in the Area in conformity with the terms of its contract and its obligations under the Convention. A sponsoring State shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that State Party has adopted laws and regulations and taken administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction.\n5.   The procedures for assessing the qualifications of States Parties which are applicants shall take into account their character as States.\n6.   The qualification standards shall require that every applicant, without exception, shall as part of his application undertake:\n(a)\nto accept as enforceable and comply with the applicable obligations created by the provisions of Part XI, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, the decisions of the organs of the Authority and terms of his contracts with the Authority;\n(b)\nto accept control by the Authority of activities in the area, as authorised by this Convention;\n(c)\nto provide the Authority with a written assurance that his obligations under the contract will be fulfilled in good faith;\n(d)\nto comply with the provisions on the transfer of technology set forth in Article 5 of this Annex.\nArticle 5\nTransfer of technology\n1.   When submitting a plan of work, every applicant shall make available to the Authority a general description of the equipment and methods to be used in carrying out activities in the area, and other relevant non-proprietary information about the characteristics of such technology and information as to where such technology is available.\n2.   Every operator shall inform the Authority of revisions in the description and information made available pursuant to paragraph 1 whenever a substantial technological change or innovation is introduced.\n3.   Every contract for carrying out activities in the area shall contain the following undertakings by the contractor:\n(a)\nto make available to the enterprise on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, whenever the Authority so requests, the technology which he uses in carrying out activities in the area under the contract, which the contractor is legally entitled to transfer. This shall be done by means of licences or other appropriate arrangements which the contractor shall negotiate with the enterprise and which shall be set forth in a specific agreement supplementary to the contract. This undertaking may be invoked only if the enterprise finds that it is unable to obtain the same or equally efficient and useful technology on the open market on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions;\n(b)\nto obtain a written assurance from the owner of any technology used in carrying out activities in the area under the contract, which is not generally available on the open market and which is not covered by subparagraph (a), that the owner will, whenever the Authority so requests, make that technology available to the enterprise under licence or other appropriate arrangements and on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, to the same extent as made available to the contractor. If this assurance is not obtained, the technology in question shall not be used by the contractor in carrying out activities in the area;\n(c)\nto acquire from the owner by means of an enforceable contract, on the request of the enterprise and if it is possible to do so without substantial cost to the contractor, the legal right to transfer to the enterprise any technology used by the contractor, in carrying out activities in the area under the contract, which the contractor is otherwise not legally entitled to transfer and which is not generally available on the open market. In cases where there is a substantial corporate relationship between the contractor and the owner of the technology, the closeness of this relationship and the degree of control or influence shall be relevant to the determination whether all feasible measures have been taken to acquire such a right. In cases where the contractor exercises effective control over the owner, failure to acquire from the owner the legal right shall be considered relevant to the contractor's qualification for any subsequent application for approval of a plan of work;\n(d)\nto facilitate, on the request of the enterprise, the acquisition by the enterprise of any technology covered by subparagraph (b), under licence or other appropriate arrangements and on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, if the enterprise decides to negotiate directly with the owner of the technology;\n(e)\nto take the same measures as are prescribed in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) for the benefit of a developing State or group of developing States which has applied for a contract under Article 9 of this Annex, provided that these measures shall be limited to the exploitation of the part of the area proposed by the contractor which has been reserved pursuant to Article 8 of this Annex and provided that activities under the contract sought by the developing State or group of developing States would not involve transfer of technology to a third State or the nationals of a third State. The obligation under this provision shall only apply with respect to any given contractor where technology has not been requested by the enterprise or transferred by that contractor to the enterprise.\n4.   Disputes concerning undertakings required by paragraph 3, like other provisions of the contracts, shall be subject to compulsory settlement in accordance with Part XI and, in cases of violation of these undertakings, suspension or termination of the contract or monetary penalties may be ordered in accordance with Article 18 of this Annex. Disputes as to whether offers made by the contractor are within the range of fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions may be submitted by either party to binding commercial arbitration in accordance with the Uncitral Arbitration Rules or such other arbitration rules as may be prescribed in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority. If the finding is that the offer made by the contractor is not within the range of fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, the contractor shall be given 45 days to revise his offer to bring it within that range before the Authority takes any action in accordance with Article 18 of this Annex.\n5.   If the enterprise is unable to obtain on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions appropriate technology to enable it to commence in a timely manner the recovery and processing of minerals from the area, either the Council or the Assembly may convene a group of States Parties composed of those which are engaged in activities in the area, those which have sponsored entities which are engaged in activities in the area and other States Parties having access to such technology. This group shall consult together and shall take effective measures to ensure that such technology is made available to the enterprise on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions. Each such State Party shall take all feasible measures to this end within its own legal system.\n6.   In the case of joint ventures with the enterprise, transfer of technology will be in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement.\n7.   The undertakings required by paragraph 3 shall be included in each contract for the carrying out of activities in the area until 10 years after the commencement of commercial production by the enterprise, and may be invoked during that period.\n8.   For the purposes of this Article, ‘technology’ means the specialised equipment and technical know-how, including manuals, designs, operating instructions, training and technical advice and assistance, necessary to assemble, maintain and operate a viable system and the legal right to use these items for that purpose on a non-exclusive basis.\nArticle 6\nApproval of plans of work\n1.   Six months after the entry into force of this Convention, and thereafter each fourth month, the Authority shall take up for consideration proposed plans of work.\n2.   When considering an application for approval of a plan of work in the form of a contract, the Authority shall first ascertain whether:\n(a)\nthe applicant has complied with the procedures established for applications in accordance with Article 4 of this Annex and has given the Authority the undertakings and assurances required by that Article. In cases of non-compliance with these procedures or in the absence of any of these undertakings and assurances, the applicant shall be given 45 days to remedy these defects;\n(b)\nthe applicant possesses the requisite qualifications provided for in Article 4 of this Annex.\n3.   All proposed plans of work shall be taken up in the order in which they are received. The proposed plans of work shall comply with and be governed by the relevant provisions of this Convention and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, including those on operational requirements, financial contributions and the undertakings concerning the transfer of technology. If the proposed plans of work conform to these requirements, the Authority shall approve them provided that they are in accordance with the uniform and non-discriminatory requirements set forth in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, unless:\n(a)\npart or all of the area covered by the proposed plan of work is included in an approved plan of work or a previously submitted proposed plan of work which has not yet been finally acted on by the Authority;\n(b)\npart or all of the area covered by the proposed plan of work is disapproved by the Authority pursuant to Article 162(2)(x); or\n(c)\nthe proposed plan of work has been submitted or sponsored by a State Party which already holds:\n(i)\nplans of work for exploration and exploitation of polymetallic nodules in non-reserved areas that, together with either part of the area covered by the application for a plan of work, exceed in size 30 % of a circular area of 400 000 square kilometres surrounding the centre of either part of the area covered by the proposed plan of work;\n(ii)\nplans of work for the exploration and exploitation of polymetallic nodules in non-reserved areas which, taken together, constitute 2 % of the total sea-bed area which is not reserved or disapproved for exploitation pursuant to Article 162(2)(x).\n4.   For the purpose of the standard set forth in paragraph 3(c), a plan of work submitted by a partnership or consortium shall be counted on a pro rata basis among the sponsoring States Parties involved in accordance with Article 4(3) of this Annex. The Authority may approve plans of work covered by paragraph 3(c) if it determines that such approval would not permit a State Party or entities sponsored by it to monopolise the conduct of activities in the area or to preclude other States Parties from activities in the area.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), after the end of the interim period specified in Article 151(3), the Authority may adopt by means of rules, regulations and procedures other procedures and criteria consistent with this Convention for deciding which applicants shall have plans of work approved in cases of selection among applicants for a proposed area. These procedures and criteria shall ensure approval of plans of work on an equitable and non-discriminatory basis.\nArticle 7\nSelection among applicants for production authorisations\n1.   Six months after the entry into force of this Convention, and thereafter each fourth month, the Authority shall take up for consideration applications for production authorisations submitted during the immediately preceding period. The Authority shall issue the authorisations applied for if all such applications can be approved without exceeding the production limitation or contravening the obligations of the Authority under a commodity agreement or arrangement to which it has become a party, as provided in Article 151.\n2.   When a selection must be made among applicants for production authorisations because of the production limitation set forth in Article 151(2) to (7), or because of the obligations of the Authority under a commodity agreement or arrangement to which it has become a party, as provided for in Article 151(1), the Authority shall make the selection on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory standards set forth in its rules, regulations and procedures.\n3.   In the application of paragraph 2, the Authority shall give priority to those applicants which:\n(a)\ngive better assurance of performance, taking into account their financial and technical qualifications and their performance, if any, under previously approved plans of work;\n(b)\nprovide earlier prospective financial benefits to the Authority, taking into account when commercial production is scheduled to begin;\n(c)\nhave already invested the most resources and effort in prospecting or exploration.\n4.   Applicants which are not selected in any period shall have priority in subsequent periods until they receive a production authorisation.\n5.   Selection shall be made taking into account the need to enhance opportunities for all States Parties, irrespective of their social and economic systems or geographical locations so as to avoid discrimination against any State or system, to participate in activities in the area and to prevent monopolisation of those activities.\n6.   Whenever fewer reserved areas than non-reserved areas are under exploitation, applications for production authorisations with respect to reserved areas shall have priority.\n7.   The decisions referred to in this Article shall be taken as soon as possible after the close of each period.\nArticle 8\nReservation of areas\nEach application, other than those submitted by the enterprise or by any other entities for reserved areas, shall cover a total area, which need not be a single continuous area, sufficiently large and of sufficient estimated commercial value to allow two mining operations. The applicant shall indicate the coordinates dividing the area into two parts of equal estimated commercial value and submit all the data obtained by him with respect to both parts. Without prejudice to the powers of the Authority pursuant to Article 17 of this Annex, the data to be submitted concerning polymetallic nodules shall relate to mapping, sampling, the abundance of nodules, and their metal content. Within 45 days of receiving such data, the Authority shall designate which part is to be reserved solely for the conduct of activities by the Authority through the enterprise or in association with developing States. This designation may be deferred for a further period of 45 days if the Authority requests an independent expert to assess whether all data required by this Article has been submitted. The area designated shall become a reserved area as soon as the plan of work for the non-reserved area is approved and the contract is signed.\nArticle 9\nActivities in reserved areas\n1.   The enterprise shall be given an opportunity to decide whether it intends to carry out activities in each reserved area. This decision may be taken at any time, unless a notification pursuant to paragraph 4 is received by the Authority, in which event the enterprise shall take its decision within a reasonable time. The enterprise may decide to exploit such areas in joint ventures with the interested State or entity.\n2.   The enterprise may conclude contracts for the execution of part of its activities in accordance with Annex IV, Article 12. It may also enter into joint ventures for the conduct of such activities with any entities which are eligible to carry out activities in the area pursuant to Article 153(2)(b). When considering such joint ventures, the enterprise shall offer to States Parties which are developing States and their nationals the opportunity of effective participation.\n3.   The Authority may prescribe, in its rules, regulations and procedures, substantive and procedural requirements and conditions with respect to such contracts and joint ventures.\n4.   Any State Party which is a developing State or any natural or juridical person sponsored by it and effectively controlled by it or by another developing State which is a qualified applicant, or any group of the foregoing, may notify the Authority that it wishes to submit a plan of work pursuant to Article 6 of this Annex with respect to a reserved area. The plan of work shall be considered if the enterprise decides, pursuant to paragraph 1, that it does not intend to carry out activities in that area.\nArticle 10\nPreference and priority among applicants\nAn operator who has an approved plan of work for exploration only, as provided in Article 3(4)(c) of this Annex shall have a preference and a priority among applicants for a plan of work covering exploitation of the same area and resources. However, such preference or priority may be withdrawn if the operator's performance has not been satisfactory.\nArticle 11\nJoint arrangements\n1.   Contracts may provide for joint arrangements between the contractor and the Authority through the enterprise, in the form of joint ventures or production-sharing, as well as any other form of joint arrangement, which shall have the same protection against revision, suspension or termination as contracts with the Authority.\n2.   Contractors entering into such joint arrangements with the enterprise may receive financial incentives as provided for in Article 13 of this Annex.\n3.   Partners in joint ventures with the enterprise shall be liable for the payments required by Article 13 of this Annex to the extent of their share in the joint ventures, subject to financial incentives as provided for in that Article.\nArticle 12\nActivities carried out by the enterprise\n1.   Activities in the area carried out by the enterprise pursuant to Article 153(2)(a) shall be governed by Part XI, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority and its relevant decisions.\n2.   Any plan of work submitted by the enterprise shall be accompanied by evidence supporting its financial and technical capabilities.\nArticle 13\nFinancial terms of contracts\n1.   In adopting rules, regulations and procedures concerning the financial terms of a contract between the Authority and the entities referred to in Article 153(2)(b), and in negotiating those financial terms in accordance with Part XI and those rules, regulations and procedures, the Authority shall be guided by the following objectives:\n(a)\nto ensure optimum revenues for the Authority from the proceeds of commercial production;\n(b)\nto attract investments and technology to the exploration and exploitation of the area;\n(c)\nto ensure equality of financial treatment and comparable financial obligations for contractors;\n(d)\nto provide incentives on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis for contractors to undertake joint arrangements with the enterprise and developing States or their nationals, to stimulate the transfer of technology thereto, and to train the personnel of the Authority and of developing States;\n(e)\nto enable the enterprise to engage in sea-bed mining effectively at the same time as the entities referred to in Article 153(2)(b); and\n(f)\nto ensure that, as a result of the financial incentives provided to contractors under paragraph 14, under the terms of contracts reviewed in accordance with Article 19 of this Annex or under the provisions of Article 11 of this Annex with respect to joint ventures, contractors are not subsidised so as to be given an artificial competitive advantage with respect to land-based miners.\n2.   A fee shall be levied for the administrative cost of processing an application for approval of a plan of work in the form of a contract and shall be fixed at an amount of USD 500 000 per application. The amount of the fee shall be reviewed from time to time by the Council in order to ensure that it covers the administrative cost incurred. If such administrative cost incurred by the Authority in processing an application is less than the fixed amount, the Authority shall refund the difference to the applicant.\n3.   A contractor shall pay an annual fixed fee of USD 1 million from the date of entry into force of the contract. If the approved date of commencement of commercial production is postponed because of a delay in issuing the production authorisation, in accordance with Article 151, the annual fixed fee shall be waived for the period of postponement. From the date of commencement of commercial production, the contractor shall pay either the production charge or the annual fixed fee, whichever is greater.\n4.   Within a year of the date of commencement of commercial production, in conformity with paragraph 3, a contractor shall choose to make his financial contribution to the Authority by either:\n(a)\npaying a production charge only; or\n(b)\npaying a combination of a production charge and a share of net proceeds.\n5.\n(a)\nIf a contractor chooses to make his financial contribution to the Authority by paying a production charge only, it shall be fixed at a percentage of the market value of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract. This percentage shall be fixed as follows:\n(i)\nyears 1 to 10 of commercial production: 5 %;\n(ii)\nyears 11 to the end of commercial production: 12 %.\n(b)\nThe said market value shall be the product of the quantity of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules extracted from the area covered by the contract and the average price for those metals during the relevant accounting year, as defined in paragraphs 7 and 8.\n6.   If a contractor chooses to make his financial contribution to the Authority by paying a combination of a production charge and a share of net proceeds, such payments shall be determined as follows:\n(a)\nThe production charge shall be fixed at a percentage of the market value, determined in accordance with subparagraph (b), of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract. This percentage shall be fixed as follows:\n(i)\nfirst period of commercial production: 2 %;\n(ii)\nsecond period of commercial production: 4 %.\nIf, in the second period of commercial production, as defined in subparagraph (d), the return on investment in any accounting year as defined in subparagraph (m) falls below 15 % as a result of the payment of the production charge at 4 %, the production charge shall be 2 % instead of 4 per cent in that accounting year.\n(b)\nThe said market value shall be the product of the quantity of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract and the average price for those metals during the relevant accounting year as defined in paragraphs 7 and 8.\n(c)\n(i)\nThe Authority's share of net proceeds shall be taken out of that portion of the contractor's net proceeds which is attributable to the mining of the resources of the area covered by the contract, referred to hereinafter as attributable net proceeds.\n(ii)\nThe Authority's share of attributable net proceeds shall be determined in accordance with the following incremental schedule:\nShare of the Authority\nPortion of attributable net proceeds\nFirst period of commercial production\nSecond period of commercial production\nThat portion representing a return on investment which is greater than 0 %, but less than 10 %\n35 %\n40 %\nThat portion representing a return on investment which is 10 % or greater, but less than 20 %\n42,5 %\n50 %\nThat portion representing a return on investment which is 20 % or greater\n50 %\n70 %\n(d)\n(i)\nThe first period of commercial production referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (c) shall commence in the first accounting year of commercial production and terminate in the accounting year in which the contractor's development costs with interest on the unrecovered portion thereof are fully recovered by his cash surplus, as follows:\nIn the first accounting year during which development costs are incurred, unrecovered development costs shall equal the development costs less cash surplus in the year. In each subsequent accounting year, unrecovered development costs shall equal the unrecovered development costs at the end of the preceding accounting year, plus interest thereon at the rate of 10 % per annum, plus development costs incurred in the current accounting year and less contractor's cash surplus in the current accounting year. The accounting year in which unrecovered development costs become zero for the first time shall be the accounting year in which the contractor's development costs with interest on the unrecovered portion thereof are fully recovered by his cash surplus. The contractor's cash surplus in any accounting year shall be his gross proceeds less his operating costs and less his payments to the Authority under subparagraph (c).\n(ii)\nThe second period of commercial production shall commence in the accounting year following the termination of the first period of commercial production and shall continue until the end of the contract.\n(e)\n‘Attributable net proceeds’ means the product of the contractor's net proceeds and the ratio of the development costs in the mining sector to the contractor's development costs. If the contractor engages in mining, transporting polymetallic nodules and production primarily of three processed metals, namely, cobalt, copper and nickel, the amount of attributable net proceeds shall not be less than 25 % of the contractor's net proceeds. Subject to subparagraph (n), in all other cases, including those where the contractor engages in mining, transporting polymetallic nodules, and production primarily of four processed metals, namely, cobalt, copper, manganese and nickel, the Authority may, in its rules, regulations and procedures, prescribe appropriate floors which shall bear the same relationship to each case as the 25 % floor does to the three-metal case.\n(f)\n‘Contractor's net proceeds’ means the contractor's gross proceeds less his operating costs and less the recovery of his development costs as set out in subparagraph (j).\n(g)\n(i)\nIf the contractor engages in mining, transporting polymetallic nodules and production of processed metals, ‘contractor's gross proceeds’ means the gross revenues from the sale of the processed metals and any other monies deemed reasonably attributable to operations under the contract in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.\n(ii)\nIn all cases other than those specified in subparagraphs (g)(i) and (n)(iii), ‘contractor's gross proceeds’ means the gross revenues from the sale of the semi-processed metals from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract, and any other monies deemed reasonably attributable to operations under the contract in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.\n(h)\n‘Contractor's development costs’ means:\n(i)\nall expenditures incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production which are directly related to the development of the productive capacity of the area covered by the contract and the activities related thereto for operations under the contract in all cases other than that specified in subparagraph (n), in conformity with generally recognised accounting principles, including, inter alia, costs of machinery, equipment, ships, processing plant, construction, buildings, land, roads, prospecting and exploration of the area covered by the contract, research and development, interest, required leases, licences and fees; and\n(ii)\nexpenditures similar to those set forth in (i) incurred subsequent to the commencement of commercial production and necessary to carry out the plan of work, except those chargeable to operating costs.\n(i)\nThe proceeds from the disposal of capital assets and the market value of those capital assets which are no longer required for operations under the contract and which are not sold shall be deducted from the contractor's development costs during the relevant accounting year. When these deductions exceed the contractor's development costs the excess shall be added to the contractor's gross proceeds.\n(j)\nThe contractor's development costs incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production referred to in subparagraphs (h)(i) and (n)(iv) shall be recovered in 10 equal annual instalments from the date of commencement of commercial production. The contractor's development costs incurred subsequent to the commencement of commercial production referred to in subparagraphs (h)(ii) and (n)(iv) shall be recovered in 10 or fewer equal annual instalments so as to ensure their complete recovery by the end of the contract.\n(k)\n‘Contractor's operating costs’ means all expenditures incurred after the commencement of commercial production in the operation of the productive capacity of the area covered by the contract and the activities related thereto for operations under the contract, in conformity with generally recognised accounting principles, including, inter alia, the annual fixed fee or the production charge, whichever is greater, expenditures for wages, salaries, employee benefits, materials, services, transporting, processing and marketing costs, interest, utilities, preservation of the marine environment, overhead and administrative costs specifically related to operations under the contract, and any net operating losses carried forward or backward as specified herein. Net operating losses may be carried forward for two consecutive years except in the last two years of the contract in which case they may be carried backward to the two preceding years.\n(l)\nIf the contractor engages in mining, transporting of polymetallic nodules, and production of processed and semi-processed metals, ‘development costs of the mining sector’ means the portion of the contractor's development costs which is directly related to the mining of the resources of the area covered by the contract, in conformity with generally recognised accounting principles, and the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, including, inter alia, application fee, annual fixed fee and, where applicable, costs of prospecting and exploration of the area covered by the contract, and a portion of research and development costs.\n(m)\n‘Return on investment’ in any accounting year means the ratio of attributable net proceeds in that year to the development costs of the mining sector. For the purpose of computing this ratio the development costs of the mining sector shall include expenditures on new or replacement equipment in the mining sector less the original cost of the equipment replaced.\n(n)\nIf the contractor engages in mining only:\n(i)\n‘attributable net proceeds’ means the whole of the contractor's net proceeds;\n(ii)\n‘contractor's net proceeds’ shall be as defined in subparagraph (f);\n(iii)\n‘contractor's gross proceeds’ means the gross revenues from the sale of the polymetallic nodules, and any other monies deemed reasonably attributable to operations under the contract in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority;\n(iv)\n‘contractor's development costs’ means all expenditures incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production as set forth in subparagraph (h)(i), and all expenditures incurred subsequent to the commencement of commercial production as set forth in subparagraph (h)(ii), which are directly related to the mining of the resources of the area covered by the contract, in conformity with generally recognised accounting principles;\n(v)\n‘contractor's operating costs’ means the contractor's operating costs as in subparagraph (k) which are directly related to the. mining of the resources of the area covered by the contract in conformity with generally recognised accounting principles;\n(vi)\n‘return on investment’ in any accounting year means the ratio of the contractor's net proceeds in that year to the contractor's development costs.

For this purpose, the Authority shall specify, in its financial rules, regulations and procedures, the relevant international terminal market. For the metals which are not traded on such markets, ‘processed metals’ means the metals in the most basic form in which they are customarily traded in representative arm's length transactions.\n(b)\nIf the Authority cannot otherwise determine the quantity of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract referred to in paragraphs 5(b) and 6(b), the quantity shall be determined on the basis of the metal content of the nodules, processing recovery efficiency and other relevant factors, in accordance with the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority and in conformity with generally recognised accounting principles.\n8.   If an international terminal market provides a representative pricing mechanism for processed metals, polymetallic nodules and semi-processed metals from the nodules, the average price on that market shall be used. In all other cases, the Authority shall, after consulting the contractor, determine a fair price for the said products in accordance with paragraph 9.\n9.\n(a)\nAll costs, expenditures, proceeds and revenues and all determinations of price and value referred to in this Article shall be the result of free market or arm's length transactions. In the absence thereof, they shall be determined by the Authority, after consulting the contractor, as though they were the result of free market or arm's length transactions, taking into account relevant transactions in other markets.\n(b)\nIn order to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the provisions of this paragraph, the Authority shall be guided by the principles adopted for, and the interpretation given to, arm's length transactions by the Commission on Transnational Corporations of the United Nations, the Group of Experts on Tax Treaties between Developing and Developed Countries and other international organisations, and shall, in its rules, regulations and procedures, specify uniform and internationally acceptable accounting rules and procedures, and the means of selection by the contractor of certified independent accountants acceptable to the Authority for the purpose of carrying out auditing in compliance with those rules, regulations and procedures.\n10.   The contractor shall make available to the accountants, in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, such financial data as are required to determine compliance with this Article.\n11.   All costs, expenditures, proceeds and revenues, and all prices and values referred to in this Article, shall be determined in accordance with generally recognised accounting principles and the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.\n12.   Payments to the Authority under paragraphs 5 and 6 shall be made in freely usable currencies or currencies which are freely available and effectively usable on the major foreign exchange markets or, at the contractor's option, in the equivalents of processed metals at market value. The market value shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 5(b). The freely usable currencies and currencies which are freely available and effectively usable on the major foreign exchange markets shall be defined in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority in accordance with prevailing international monetary practice.\n13.   All financial obligations of the contractor to the Authority, as well as all his fees, costs, expenditures, proceeds and revenues referred to in this Article, shall be adjusted by expressing them in constant terms relative to a base year.\n14.   The Authority may, taking into account any recommendations of the Economic Planning Commission and the Legal and Technical Commission, adopt rules, regulations and procedures that provide for incentives, on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis, to contractors to further the objectives set out in paragraph 1.\n15.

Transferred data in respect of the area covered by the plan of work, deemed proprietary, may only be used for the purposes set forth in this article. Data necessary for the formulation by the Authority of rules, regulations and procedures concerning protection of the marine environment and safety, other than equipment design data, shall not be deemed proprietary.\n3.   Data transferred to the Authority by prospectors, applicants for contracts or contractors, deemed proprietary, shall not be disclosed by the Authority to the enterprise or to anyone external to the Authority, but data on the reserved areas may be disclosed to the enterprise. Such data transferred by such persons to the enterprise shall not be disclosed by the enterprise to the Authority or to anyone external to the Authority.\nArticle 15\nTraining programmes\nThe contractor shall draw up practical programmes for the training of personnel of the Authority and developing States, including the participation of such personnel in all activities in the area which are covered by the contract, in accordance with Article 144(2).\nArticle 16\nExclusive right to explore and exploit\nThe Authority shall, pursuant to Part XI and its rules, regulations and procedures, accord the operator the exclusive right to explore and exploit the area covered by the plan of work in respect of a specified category of resources and shall ensure that no other entity operates in the same area for a different category of resources in a manner which might interfere with the operations of the operator. The operator shall have security of tenure in accordance with Article 153(6).\nArticle 17\nRules, regulations and procedures of the Authority\n1.   The Authority shall adopt and uniformly apply rules, regulations and procedures in accordance with Article 160(2)(f) (ii), and Article 162(2)(o)(ii) for the exercise of its functions as set forth in Part XI on, inter alia, the following matters:\n(a)\nadministrative procedures relating to prospecting, exploration and exploitation in the area;\n(b)\noperations:\n(i)\nsize of area;\n(ii)\nduration of operations;\n(iii)\nperformance requirements including assurances pursuant to Article 4(6)(c) of this Annex;\n(iv)\ncategories of resources;\n(v)\nrenunciation of areas;\n(vi)\nprogress reports;\n(vii)\nsubmission of data;\n(viii)\ninspection and supervision of operations;\n(ix)\nprevention of interference with other activities in the marine environment;\n(x)\ntransfer of rights and obligations by a contractor;\n(xi)\nprocedures for transfer of technology to developing States in accordance with Article 144 and for their direct participation;\n(xii)\nmining standards and practices, including those relating to operational safety, conservation of the resources and the protection of the marine environment;\n(xiii)\ndefinition of commercial production;\n(xiv)\nqualification standards for applicants;\n(c)\nfinancial matters:\n(i)\nestablishment of uniform and non-discriminatory costing and accounting rules and the method of selection of auditors;\n(ii)\napportionment of proceeds of operations;\n(iii)\nthe incentives referred to in Article 13 of this Annex;\n(d)\nimplementation of decisions taken pursuant to Article 151(10) and Article 164(2)(d).\n2.   Rules, regulations and procedures on the following items shall fully reflect the objective criteria set out below:\n(a)\nSize of areas\nThe Authority shall determine the appropriate size of areas for exploration which may be up to twice as large as those for exploitation in order to permit intensive exploration operations. The size of area shall be calculated to satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of this Annex on reservation of areas as well as stated production requirements consistent with Article 151 in accordance with the terms of the contract taking into account the state of the art of technology then available for sea-bed mining and the relevant physical characteristics of the areas areas shall be neither smaller nor larger than are necessary to satisfy this objective.\n(b)\nDuration of operations\n(i)\nprospecting shall be without time limit;\n(ii)\nexploration should be of sufficient duration to permit a thorough survey of the specific area, the design and construction of mining equipment for the area and the design and construction of small and medium-sized processing plants for the purpose of testing mining and processing systems;\n(iii)\nthe duration of exploitation should be related to the economic life of the mining project, taking into consideration such factors as the depletion of the ore, the useful life of mining equipment and processing facilities and commercial viability. Exploitation should be of sufficient duration to permit commercial extraction of minerals of the area and should include a reasonable time period for construction of commercial-scale mining and processing systems, during which period commercial production should not be required. The total duration of exploitation, however, should also be short enough to give the Authority an opportunity to amend the terms and conditions of the plan of work at the time it considers renewal in accordance with rules, regulations and procedures which it has adopted subsequent to approving the plan of work.\n(c)\nPerformance requirements\nThe Authority shall require that during the exploration stage periodic expenditures be made by the operator which are reasonably related to the size of the area covered by the plan of work and the expenditures which would be expected of a bona fide operator who intended to bring the area into commercial production within the time limits established by the Authority. The required expenditures should not be established at a level which would discourage prospective operators with less costly technology than is prevalently in use. The Authority shall establish a maximum time interval, after the exploration stage is completed and the exploitation stage begins, to achieve commercial production. To determine this interval, the Authority should take into consideration that construction of large-scale mining and processing systems cannot be initiated until after the termination of the exploration stage and the commencement of the exploitation stage. Accordingly, the interval to bring an area into commercial production should take into account the time necessary for this construction after the completion of the exploration stage and reasonable allowance should be made for unavoidable delays in the construction schedule. Once commercial production is achieved, the Authority shall within reasonable limits and taking into consideration all relevant factors require the operator to maintain commercial production throughout the period of the plan of work.\n(d)\nCategories of resources\nIn determining the category of resources in respect of which a plan of work may be approved, the Authority shall give emphasis inter alia to the following characteristics:\n(i)\nthat certain resources require the use of similar mining methods; and\n(ii)\nthat some resources can be developed simultaneously without undue interference between operators developing different resources in the same area.\nNothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the Authority from approving a plan of work with respect to more than one category of resources in the same area to the same applicant.\n(e)\nRenunciation of areas\nThe operator shall have the right at any time to renounce without penalty the whole or part of his rights in the area covered by a plan of work.\n(f)\nProtection of the marine environment\nRules, regulations and procedures shall be drawn up in order to secure effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects directly resulting from activities in the area or from shipboard processing immediately above a mine site of minerals derived from that mine site, taking into account the extent to which such harmful effects may directly result from drilling, dredging, coring and excavation and from disposal, dumping and discharge into the marine environment of sediment, wastes or other effluents.\n(g)\nCommercial production\nCommercial production shall be deemed to have begun if an operator engages in sustained large-scale recovery operations which yield a quantity of materials sufficient to indicate clearly that the principal purpose is large-scale production rather than production intended for information gathering, analysis or the testing of equipment or plant.\nArticle 18\nPenalties\n1.   A contractor's rights under the contract may be suspended or terminated only in the following cases:\n(a)\nif, in spite of warnings by the Authority, the contractor has conducted his activities in such a way as to result in serious, persistent and wilful violations of the fundamental terms of the contract, Part XI and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority; or\n(b)\nif the contractor has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to him.\n2.   In the case of any violation of the contract not covered by paragraph l(a), or in lieu of suspension or termination under paragraph l(a), the Authority may impose on the contractor monetary penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.\n3.   Except for emergency orders under Article 162(2)(w), the Authority may not execute a decision involving monetary penalties, suspension or termination until the contractor has been accorded a reasonable opportunity to exhaust the judicial remedies available to him pursuant to Part XI, Section 5.\nArticle 19\nRevision of contract\n1.   When circumstances have arisen or are likely to arise which, in the opinion of either party, would render the contract inequitable or make it impracticable or impossible to achieve the objectives set out in the contract or in Part XI, the parties shall enter into negotiations to revise it accordingly.\n2.   Any contract entered into in accordance with Article 153(3) may be revised only with the consent of the parties.\nArticle 20\nTransfer of rights and obligations\nThe rights and obligations arising under a contract may be transferred only with the consent of the Authority, and in accordance with its rules, regulations and procedures. The Authority shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the transfer if the proposed transferee is in all respects a qualified applicant and assumes all of the obligations of the transferor and if the transfer does not confer to the transferee a plan of work, the approval of which would be forbidden by Article 6(3)(c) of this Annex.\nArticle 21\nApplicable law\n1.   The contract shall be governed by the terms of the contract, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, Part XI and other rules of international law not incompatible with this Convention.\n2.   Any final decision rendered by a court or tribunal having jurisdiction under this Convention relating to the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the contractor shall be enforceable in the territory of each State Party.\n3.   No State Party may impose conditions on a contractor that are inconsistent with Part XI. However, the application by a State Party to contractors sponsored by it, or to ships flying its flag, of environmental or other laws and regulations more stringent than those in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority adopted pursuant to Article 17(2)(f) of this Annex shall not be deemed inconsistent with Part XI.\nArticle 22\nResponsibility\nThe contractor shall have responsibility or liability for any damage arising out of wrongful acts in the conduct of its operations, account being taken of contributory acts or omissions by the Authority. Similarly, the Authority shall have responsibility or liability for any damage arising out of wrongful acts in the exercise of its powers and functions, including violations under Article 168(2), account being taken of contributory acts or omissions by the contractor. Liability in every case shall be for the actual amount of damage.\nANNEX IV\nSTATUTE OF THE ENTERPRISE\nArticle 1\nPurposes\n1.

Such extensions shall be approved if the contractor has made efforts in good faith to comply with the requirements of the plan of work but for reasons beyond the contractor's control has been unable to complete the necessary preparatory work for proceeding to the exploitation stage or if the prevailing economic circumstances do not justify proceeding to the exploitation stage.\n10.\nDesignation of a reserved area for the Authority in accordance with Annex III, Article 8, of the Convention shall take place in connection with approval of an application for a plan of work for exploration or approval of an application for a plan of work for exploration and exploitation.\n11.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 9, an approved plan of work for exploration which is sponsored by at least one State provisionally applying this Agreement shall terminate if such a State ceases to apply this Agreement provisionally and has not become a member on a provisional basis in accordance with paragraph 12 or has not become a State Party.\n12.\nOn the entry into force of this Agreement, States and entities referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement which have been applying it provisionally in accordance with Article 7 and for which it is not in force may continue to be members of the Authority on a provisional basis pending its entry into force for such States and entities, in accordance with the following subparagraphs:\n(a)\nif this Agreement enters into force before 16 November 1996, such States and entities shall be entitled to continue to participate as members of the Authority on a provisional basis on notification to the depository of the Agreement by such a State or entity of its intention to participate as a member on a provisional basis. Such membership shall terminate either on 16 November 1996 or on the entry into force of this Agreement and the Convention for such member, whichever is earlier. The Council may, on the request of the State or entity concerned, extend such membership beyond 16 November 1996 for a further period or periods not exceeding a total of two years provided that the Council is satisfied that the State or entity concerned has been making efforts in good faith to become a party to the Agreement and the Convention;\n(b)\nif this Agreement enters into force after 15 November 1996, such States and entities may request the Council to grant continued membership in the Authority on a provisional basis for a period or periods not extending beyond 16 November 1998. The Council shall grant such membership with effect from the date of the request if it is satisfied that the State or entity has been making efforts in good faith to become a party to the Agreement and the Convention;\n(c)\nStates and entities which are members of the Authority on a provisional basis in accordance with subparagraph (a) or (b) shall apply the terms of Part XI and this Agreement in accordance with their national or internal laws, regulations and annual budgetary appropriations and shall have the same rights and obligations as other members, including:\n(i)\nthe obligation to contribute to the administrative budget of the Authority in accordance with the scale of assessed contributions;\n(ii)\nthe right to sponsor an application for approval of a plan of work for exploration. In the case of entities whose components are natural or juridical persons possessing the nationality of more than one State, a plan of work for exploration shall not be approved unless all the States whose natural or juridical persons comprise those entities are States Parties or members on a provisional basis;\n(d)\nnotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 9, an approved plan of work in the form of a contract for exploration which was sponsored pursuant to subparagraph (c)(ii) by a State which was a member on a provisional basis shall terminate if such membership ceases and the State or entity has not become a State Party;\n(e)\nif such a member has failed to make its assessed contributions or otherwise failed to comply with its obligations in accordance with this paragraph, its membership on a provisional basis shall be terminated.\n13.\nThe reference in Annex III, Article 10, of the Convention to performance which has not been satisfactory shall be interpreted to mean that the contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of an approved plan of work in spite of a written warning or warnings from the Authority to the contractor to comply therewith.\n14.\nThe Authority shall have its own budget. Until the end of the year following the year during which this Agreement enters into force, the administrative expenses of the Authority shall be met through the budget of the United Nations. Thereafter, the administrative expenses of the Authority shall be met by assessed contributions of its members, including any members on a provisional basis, in accordance with Article 171 (a) and Article 173 of the Convention and this Agreement, until the Authority has sufficient funds from other sources to meet those expenses. The Authority shall not exercise the power referred to in Article 174(1) of the Convention to borrow funds to finance its administrative budget.\n15.\nThe Authority shall elaborate and adopt, in accordance with Article 162(2)(o)(ii) of the Convention, rules, regulations and procedures based on the principles contained in Sections 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this Annex, as well as any additional rules, regulations and procedures necessary to facilitate the approval of plans of work for exploration or exploitation, in accordance with the following subparagraphs:\n(a)\nthe Council may undertake such elaboration any time it deems that all or any of such rules, regulations or procedures are required for the conduct of activities in the Area, or when it determines that commercial exploitation is imminent, or at the request of a State whose national intends to apply for approval of a plan of work for exploitation;\n(b)\nif a request is made by a State referred to in subparagraph (a) the Council shall, in accordance with Article 162(2)(o) of the Convention, complete the adoption of such rules, regulations and procedures within two years of the request;\n(c)\nif the Council has not completed the elaboration of the rules, regulations and procedures relating to exploitation within the prescribed time and an application for approval of a plan of work for exploitation is pending, it shall nonetheless consider and provisionally approve such plan of work based on the provisions of the Convention and any rules, regulations and procedures that the Council may have adopted provisionally, or on the basis of the norms contained in the Convention and the terms and principles contained in this Annex as well as the principle of non-discrimination among contractors.\n16.\nThe draft rules, regulations and procedures and any recommendations relating to the provisions of Part XI, as contained in the reports and recommendations of the Preparatory Commission, shall be taken into account by the Authority in the adoption of rules, regulations and procedures in accordance with Part XI and this Agreement.\n17.\nThe relevant provisions of Part XI, Section 4, of the Convention shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with this Agreement.\nSECTION 2\nThe enterprise\n1.\nThe secretariat of the Authority shall perform the functions of the enterprise until it begins to operate independently of the secretariat. The Secretary-General of the Authority shall appoint from within the staff of the Authority an interim Director-General to oversee the performance of these functions by the secretariat.\nThese functions shall be:\n(a)\nmonitoring and review of trends and developments relating to deep sea-bed mining activities, including regular analysis of world metal market conditions and metal prices, trends and prospects;\n(b)\nassessment of the results of the conduct of marine scientific research with respect to activities in the area, with particular emphasis on research related to the environmental impact of activities in the area;\n(c)\nassessment of available data relating to prospecting and exploration, including the criteria for such activities;\n(d)\nassessment of technological developments relevant to activities in the area, in particular technology relating to the protection and preservation of the marine environment;\n(e)\nevaluation of information and data relating to areas reserved for the Authority;\n(f)\nassessment of approaches to joint-venture operations;\n(g)\ncollection of information on the availability of trained manpower;\n(h)\nstudy of managerial policy options for the administration of the enterprise at different stages of its operations.\n2.\nThe enterprise shall conduct its initial deep sea-bed mining operations through joint ventures. On the approval of a plan of work for exploitation for an entity other than the enterprise, or on receipt by the Council of an application for a joint-venture operation with the enterprise, the Council shall take up the issue of the functioning of the enterprise independently of the secretariat of the Authority. If joint-venture operations with the enterprise accord with sound commercial principles, the Council shall issue a directive pursuant to Article 170(2) of the Convention providing for such independent functioning.\n3.\nThe obligation of States Parties to fund one mine site of the enterprise as provided for in Annex IV, Article 11(3) of the Convention shall not apply and States Parties shall be under no obligation to finance any of the operations in any mine site of the enterprise or under its joint-venture arrangements.\n4.\nThe obligations applicable to contractors shall apply to the enterprise. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 153(3) and Annex III, Article 3(5) of the Convention, a plan of work for the enterprise on its approval shall be in the form of a contract concluded between the Authority and the enterprise.\n5.\nA contractor which has contributed a particular area to the Authority as a reserved area has the right of first refusal to enter into a joint-venture arrangement with the enterprise for exploration and exploitation of that area. If the enterprise does not submit an application for a plan of work for activities in respect of such a reserved area within 15 years of the commencement of its functions independent of the secretariat of the Authority or within 15 years of the date on which that area is reserved for the Authority, whichever is the later, the contractor which contributed the area shall be entitled to apply for a plan of work for that area provided it offers in good faith to include the enterprise as a joint-venture partner.\n6.\nArticle 170(4), Annex IV and other provisions of the Convention relating to the enterprise shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with this section.\nSECTION 3\nDecision-making\n1.\nThe general policies of the Authority shall be established by the Assembly in collaboration with the Council.\n2.\nAs a general rule, decision-making in the organs of the Authority should be by consensus.\n3.\nIf all efforts to reach a decision by consensus have been exhausted, decisions by voting in the Assembly on questions of procedure shall be taken by a majority of members present and voting, and decisions on questions of substance shall be taken by a two-thirds majority of members present and voting, as provided for in Article 159(8) of the Convention.\n4.\nDecisions of the Assembly on any matter for which the Council also has competence or on any administrative, budgetary or financial matter shall be based on the recommendations of the Council. If the Assembly does not accept the recommendation of the Council on any matter, it shall return the matter to the Council for further consideration. The Council shall reconsider the matter in the light of the views expressed by the Assembly.\n5.\nIf all efforts to reach a decision by consensus have been exhausted, decisions by voting in the Council on questions of procedure shall be taken by a majority of members present and voting, and decisions on questions of substance, except where the Convention provides for decisions by consensus in the Council, shall be taken by a two-thirds majority of members present and voting, provided that such decisions are not opposed by a majority in any one of the chambers referred to in paragraph 9. In taking decisions the Council shall seek to promote the interests of all the members of the Authority.\n6.\nThe Council may defer the taking of a decision in order to facilitate further negotiation whenever it appears that all efforts at achieving consensus on a question have not been exhausted.\n7.\nDecisions by the Assembly or the Council having financial or budgetary implications shall be based on the recommendations of the Finance Committee.\n8.\nThe provisions of Article 161(8)(b) and (c) of the Convention shall not apply.\n9.\n(a)\nEach group of States elected under paragraph 15(a) to (c) shall be treated as a chamber for the purposes of voting in the Council. The developing States elected under paragraph 15(d) and (e) shall be treated as a single chamber for the purposes of voting in the Council.\n(b)\nBefore electing the members of the Council, the Assembly shall establish lists of countries fulfilling the criteria for membership in the groups of States in paragraph 15(a) to (d). If a State fulfils the criteria for membership in more than one group, it may only be proposed by one group for election to the Council and it shall represent only that group in voting in the Council.\n10.\nEach group of States in paragraph 15(a) to (d) shall be represented in the Council by those members nominated by that group. Each group shall nominate only as many candidates as the number of seats required to be filled by that group. When the number of potential candidates in each of the groups referred to in paragraph 15(a) to (e) exceeds the number of seats available in each of those respective groups, as a general rule, the principle of rotating shall apply. States members of each of those groups shall determine how this principle shall apply in those groups.\n11.\n(a)\nThe Council shall approve a recommendation by the Legal and Technical Commission for approval of a plan of work unless by a two-thirds majority of its members present and voting, including a majority of members present and voting in each of the chambers of the Council, the Council decides to disapprove a plan of work. If the Council does not take a decision on a recommendation for approval of a plan of work within a prescribed period, the recommendation shall be deemed to have been approved by the Council at the end of that period. The prescribed period shall normally be 60 days unless the Council decides to provide for a longer period. If the Commission recommends the disapproval of a plan of work or does not make a recommendation, the Council may nevertheless approve the plan of work in accordance with its rules of procedures for decision-making on questions of substance.\n(b)\nThe provisions of Article 162(2)(j) of the Convention shall not apply.\n12.\nWhere a dispute arises relating to the disapproval of a plan of work, such dispute shall be submitted to the dispute settlement procedures set out in the Convention.\n13.\nDecisions by voting in the Legal and Technical Commission shall be by a majority of members present and voting.\n14.\nPart XI, Section 4, subsections B and C, of the Convention shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with this section.\n15.\nThe Council shall consist of 36 members of the Authority elected by the Assembly in the following order:\n(a)\nfour members from among those States Parties which, during the last five years for which statistics are available, have either consumed more than 2 % in value terms of total world consumption or have had net imports of more than 2 % in value terms of total world imports of the commodities produced from the categories of minerals to be derived from the area, provided that the four members shall include one State from the East European region having the largest economy in that region in terms of gross domestic product and the State, on the date of entry into force of the Convention, having the largest economy in terms of gross domestic product, if such States wish to be represented in this group;\n(b)\nfour members from among the eight States Parties which have made the largest investments in preparation for and in the conduct of activities in the area, either directly or through their nationals;\n(c)\nfour members from among States Parties which, on the basis of production in areas under their jurisdication, are major net exporters of the categories of minerals to be derived from the area, including at least two developing States whose exports of such minerals have a substantial bearing on their economies;\n(d)\nsix members from among developing States Parties, representing special interests.

Amendments relating to this Agreement and Part XI shall be subject to the procedures contained in Articles 314, 315 and 316 of the Convention, provided that the principles, regime and other terms referred to in Article 155(2) of the Convention shall be maintained and the rights referred to in paragraph 5 of that Article shall not be affected.\nSECTION 5\nTransfer of technology\n1.\nIn addition to the provisions of Article 144 of the Convention, transfer of technology for the purposes of Part XI shall be governed by the following principles:\n(a)\nthe enterprise, and developing States wishing to obtain deep sea-bed mining technology, shall seek to obtain such technology on fair reasonable commercial terms and conditions on the open market, or through joint-venture arrangements;\n(b)\nif the enterprise or developing States are unable to obtain deep sea-bed mining technology, the Authority may request all or any of the contractors and their respective sponsoring State or States to cooperate with it in facilitating the acquisition of deep sea-bed mining technology by the enterprise or its joint venture, or by a developing State or States seeking to acquire such technology on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, consistent with the effective protection of intellectual property rights. States Parties undertake to cooperate fully and effectively with the Authority for this purpose and to ensure that contractors sponsored by them also cooperate fully with the Authority;\n(c)\nas a general rule, States Parties shall promote international technical and scientific cooperation with regard to activities in the area either between the parties concerned or by developing training, technical assistance and scientific cooperation programmes in marine science and technology and the protection and preservation of the marine environment.\n2.\nThe provisions of Annex III, Article 5, of the Convention shall not apply.\nSECTION 6\nProduction policy\n1.\nThe production of the Authority shall be based on the following principles:\n(a)\ndevelopment of the resources of the area shall take place in accordance with sound commercial principles;\n(b)\nthe provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, its relevant codes and successor or superseding agreements shall apply with respect to activities in the area;\n(c)\nin particular, there shall be no subsidisation of activities in the area except as may be permitted under the agreements referred to in subparagraph (b).

There shall be no preferential access to markets for such minerals or for imports of commodities produced from such minerals, in particular:\n(i)\nby the use of tariff or non-tariff barriers, and\n(ii)\ngiven by States Parties to such minerals or commodities produced by their State enterprises or by natural or juridical persons which possess their nationality or are controlled by them or their nationals;\n(e)\nthe plan of work for exploitation approved by the Authority in respect of each mining area shall indicate an anticipated production schedule which shall include the estimated maximum amounts of minerals that would be produced per year under the plan of work;\n(f)\nthe following shall apply to the settlement of disputes concerning the provisions of the agreements referred to in subparagraph (b):\n(i)\nwhere the States Parties concerned are parties to such agreements, they shall have recourse to the dispute settlement procedures of those agreements;\n(ii)\nwhere one or more of the State Parties concerned are not parties to such agreements, they shall have recourse to the dispute settlement procedures set out in the Convention;\n(g)\nin circumstances where a determination is made under the agreements referred to in subparagraph (b) that a State Party has engaged in subsidisation which is prohibited or has resulted in adverse effects on the interest of another State Party and appropriate steps have not been taken by the relevant State Party or States Parties, a State Party may request the Council to take appropriate measures.\n2.\nThe principles contained in paragraph 1 shall not affect the rights and obligations under any provisions of the agreements referred to in paragraph l(b), as well as the relevant free trade and customs union agreements, in relations between States Parties which are parties to such agreements.\n3.\nThe acceptance by a contractor of subsidies other than those which may be permitted under the agreements referred to in paragraph l(b) shall constitute a violation of the fundamental terms of the contract forming a plan of work for the carrying out of activities in the area.\n4.\nAny State Party which has reason to believe that there has been a breach of the requirements of paragraph 1(b) to (d) or paragraph 3 may initiate dispute settlement procedures in conformity with paragraph 1(f) or (g).\n5.\nA State Party may at any time bring to the attention of the Council activities which in its view are inconsistent with the requirements of paragraph l(b) to (d).\n6.\nThe Authority shall develop rules, regulations and procedures which ensure the implementation of the provisions of this Section, including relevant rules, regulations and procedures governing the approval of plans of work.\n7.\nThe provisions of Article 151(1) to (7) and (9), Article 162(2)(q), Article 165(2)(n), and Annex III, Article 6(5) and Article 7, of the Convention shall not apply.\nSECTION 7\nEconomic assistance\n1.\nThe policy of the Authority of assisting developing countries which suffer serious adverse effects on their export earnings or economies resulting from a reduction in the price of an affected mineral or in the volume of exports of that mineral, to the extent that such reduction is caused by activities in the area, shall be based on the following principles:\n(a)\nthe Authority shall establish an economic assistance fund from a portion of the funds of the Authority which exceeds those necessary to cover the administrative expenses of the Authority. The amount set aside for this purpose shall be determined by the Council from time to time, upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee. Only funds from payments received from contractors, including the enterprise, and voluntary contributions shall be used for the establishment of the economic assistance fund;\n(b)\ndeveloping land-based producer States whose economies have been determined to be seriously affected by the production of minerals from the deep seabed shall be assisted from the economic assistance fund of the Authority;\n(c)\nthe Authority shall provide assistance from the fund to affected developing land-based producer States, where appropriate, in cooperation with existing global or regional development institutes which have the infrastructure and expertise to carry out such assistance programmes;\n(d)\nthe extent and period of such assistance shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Any subsequent change in choice between alternative systems, however, shall be made by agreement between the Authority and the contractor;\n(d)\nan annual fixed fee shall be payable from the date of commencement of commercial production. This fee may be credited against other payments due under the system adopted in accordance with subparagraph (c).

Each group of States referred to in Section 3(15)(a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Annex shall be represented on the Committee by at least one member. Until the Authority has sufficient funds other than assessed contributions to meet its administrative expenses, the membership of the Committee shall include representatives of the five largest financial contributors to the administrative budget of the Authority. Thereafter, the election of one member from each group shall be on the basis of nomination by the members of the respective group, without prejudice to the possibility of further members being elected from each group.\n4.\nMembers of the Finance Committee shall hold office for a term of five years. They shall be eligible for re-election for a further term.\n5.\nIn the event of the death, incapacity of resignation of a member of the Finance Committee prior to the expiration of the term of office, the Assembly shall elect for the remainder of the term a member from the same geographical region or group of States.\n6.\nMembers of the Finance Committee shall have no financial interest in any activity relating to matters upon which the Committee has the responsibility to make recommendations.

The declaration concerning competence provided for in Article 5(1) of Annex IX to the Convention is attached.\nThe Community also wishes to declare, in accordance with Article 310 of the Convention, its objection to any declaration or position excluding or amending the legal scope of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and in particular those relating to fishing activities. The Community does not consider the Convention to recognise the rights or jurisdiction of coastal States regarding the exploitation, conservation and management of fishery resources other than sedentary species outside their exclusive economic zone.\nThe Community reserves the right to make subsequent declarations in respect of the Convention and the Agreement and in response to future declarations and positions.\nThe Community takes this opportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the assurance of its highest consideration.\nDECLARATION CONCERNING THE COMPETENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WITH REGARD TO MATTERS GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA OF 10 DECEMBER 1982 AND THE AGREEMENT OF 28 JULY 1994 RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PART XI OF THE CONVENTION\n(Declaration made pursuant to Article 5(1) of Annex IX to the Convention and to Article 4(4) of the Agreement)\nArticle 5(1) of Annex IX of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides that the instrument of formal confirmation of an international organisation shall contain a declaration specifying the matters governed by the Convention in respect of which competence has been transferred to the organisation by its Member States which are Parties to the Convention (1).\nArticle 4(4) of the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (2) provides that formal confirmation by an international organisation shall be in accordance with Annex IX of the Convention.\nThe European Communities were established by the Treaties of Paris (ECSC) and of Rome (EEC and Euratom), signed on 18 April 1951 and 25 March 1957 respectively. After being ratified by the Signatory States, the Treaties entered into force on 25 July 1952 and 1 January 1958. They have been amended by the Treaty on European Union, which was signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992 and entered into force, after being ratified by the Signatory States, on 1 November 1993, and most recently by the Accession Treaty signed in Corfu on 24 June 1994, which entered into force on 1 January 1995 (3).\nThe current Members of the Communities are the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the Convention shall apply, with regard to the competences transferred to the European Community, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty, in particular Article 227 thereof.\nThis declaration is not applicable to the territories of the Member States in which the said Treaty does not apply and is without prejudice to such acts or positions as may be adopted under the Convention and the Agreement by the Member States concerned on behalf of and in the interests of those territories.\nIn accordance with the provisions referred to above, this declaration indicates the competence that the Member States have transferred to the Community under the Treaties in matters governed by the Convention and the Agreement.\nThe scope and the exercise of such Community competence are, by their nature, subject to continuous development, and the Community will complete or amend this declaration, if necessary, in accordance with Article 5(4) of Annex IX to the Convention.\nThe Community has exclusive competence for certain matters and shares competence with its Member States for certain other matters.\n1.   Matters for which the Community has exclusive competence\n—\nThe Community points out that its Member States have transferred competence to it with regard to the conservation and management of sea fishing resources. Hence in this field it is for the Community to adopt the relevant rules and regulations (which are enforced by the Member States) and, within its competence, to enter into external undertakings with third States or competent international organisation. This competence applies to waters under national fisheries jurisdiction and to the high seas. Nevertheless, in respect of measures relating to the exercise of jurisdiction over vessels, flagging and registration of vessels and the enforcement of penal and administrative sanctions, competence rests with the Member States while respecting Community law. Community law also provides for administrative sanctions,\n—\nby virtue of its commercial and customs policy, the Community has competence in respect of those provisions of Parts X and XI of the Convention and of the Agreement of 28 July 1994 which are related to international trade.\n2.   Matters for which the Community shares competence with its Member States\n—\nWith regard to fisheries, for a certain number of matters that are not directly related to the conservation and management of sea fishing resources, for example research and technological development and development cooperation, there is shared competence,\n—\nwith regard to the provisions on maritime transport, safety of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution contained, inter alia, in Parts II, III, V, VII and XII of the Convention, the Community has exclusive competence only to the extent that such provisions of the Convention or legal instruments adopted in implementation thereof affect common rules established by the Community. When Community rules exist but are not affected, in particular in cases of Community provisions establishing only minimum standards, the Member States have competence, without prejudice to the competence of the Community to act in this field. Otherwise competence rests with the Member States.\nA list of relevant Community acts appears in the Appendix. The extent of Community competence ensuing from these acts must be assessed by reference to the precise provisions of each measure, and in particular, the extent to which these provisions establish common rules,\n—\nwith regard to the provisions of Parts XIII and XIV of the Convention, the Community's competence relates mainly to the promotion of cooperation on research and technological development with non-member countries and international organisations. The activities carried out by the Community here complement the activities of the Member States.
