{"celex_id": "32009R1186", "reference": "10.12.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 324/23\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1186/2009\nof 16 November 2009\nsetting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty\n(codified version)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 26, 37 and 308 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 of 28 March 1983 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nIn the absence of a specific measure of derogation adopted in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, Common Customs Tariff duties are applicable to all goods imported into the Community. The same is true in the case of agricultural levies and all other import charges laid down under the common agricultural policy or the specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products.\n(3)\nHowever, in certain well-defined circumstances, where by virtue of the special conditions under which goods are imported the usual need to protect the economy is absent, such taxation is not justified.\n(4)\nIt is desirable that in such circumstances arrangements be made, as they have been traditionally in most systems of customs rules, to allow goods to enjoy relief from the application of import duties to which they would normally be liable.\n(5)\nSuch relief arrangements may also be the result of multilateral international conventions to which all or some of the Member States are contracting parties. While the Community should apply such conventions, this presupposes the introduction of Community rules on reliefs from customs duties designed, in accordance with the requirements of the Customs Union, to eliminate differences in the aim, scope and conditions for application of the reliefs contained in those conventions, and to enable all those concerned to enjoy the same advantages throughout the Community.\n(6)\nCertain reliefs applied in the Member States stem from specific conventions concluded with third countries or international organisations. Such conventions, given their purpose, concern only the signatory Member State. It does not appear necessary to define, at Community level, conditions for granting such reliefs, but appears sufficient simply to authorise the Member State in question to grant those reliefs, where necessary, by means of an appropriate procedure instituted for this purpose.\n(7)\nThe implementation of the common agricultural policy means that in certain circumstances export duties may be charged on some goods. It is therefore also necessary to specify at Community level the cases in which relief from such duties may be granted.\n(8)\nIn the interests of legal clarity, the provisions of Community Acts containing certain relief measures not affected by this Regulation should be listed.\n(9)\nThis Regulation does not preclude the application by Member States of import or export prohibitions or restrictions which are justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security, protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants, protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historical or archaeological value or protection of industrial or commercial property.\n(10)\nWith regard to the reliefs granted within the amounts fixed in euro, rules for the conversion of such amounts into national currencies should be drawn up,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation sets out those cases in which, owing to special circumstances, relief from import duties, export duties and measures adopted on the basis of Article 133 of the Treaty shall be granted when goods are released for free circulation or are exported from the customs territory of the Community.\nArticle 2\n1.   For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(a)\n‘import duties’ means customs duties and charges having equivalent effect and also agricultural levies and other import charges provided for under the common agricultural policy or under specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products;\n(b)\n‘export duties’ means agricultural levies and other export charges provided for under the common agricultural policy or under specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products;\n(c)\n‘personal property’ means any property intended for the personal use of the persons concerned or for meeting their household needs.\nThe following, in particular, shall constitute ‘personal property’:\n(i)\nhousehold effects;\n(ii)\ncycles and motor cycles, private motor vehicles and their trailers, camping caravans, pleasure craft and private aeroplanes.\nHousehold provisions appropriate to normal family requirements, household pets and saddle animals, as well as the portable instruments of the applied or liberal arts, required by the person concerned for the pursuit of his trade or profession, shall also constitute ‘personal property’. Personal property must not be such as might indicate, by its nature or quantity, that it is being imported for commercial reasons;\n(d)\n‘household effects’ means personal effects, household linen, furnishings and equipment intended for the personal use of the persons concerned or for meeting their household needs;\n(e)\n‘alcoholic products’ means products (beer, wine, aperitifs with a wine or alcohol base, brandies, liqueurs or spirituous beverages, etc.) falling within heading Nos 2203 to 2208 of the Combined Nomenclature.\n2.   Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation for the purpose of applying Title II, ‘third countries’ also includes those parts of Member States’ territories excluded from the customs territory of the Community by virtue of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (4).\nTITLE II\nRELIEF FROM IMPORT DUTY\nCHAPTER I\nPersonal property belonging to natural persons transferring their normal place of residence from a third country to the Community\nArticle 3\nSubject to Articles 4 to 11, personal property imported by natural persons transferring their normal place of residence from a third country to the customs territory of the Community shall be admitted free of import duties.\nArticle 4\nThe relief shall be limited to personal property which:\n(a)\nexcept in special cases justified by the circumstances, has been in the possession of and, in the case of non-consumable goods, used by the person concerned at his former normal place of residence for a minimum of six months before the date on which he ceases to have his normal place of residence in the third country of departure;\n(b)\nis intended to be used for the same purpose at his new normal place of residence.\nIn addition, Member States may make relief conditional upon such property having borne, either in the country of origin or in the country of departure, the customs and/or fiscal charges to which it is normally liable.\nArticle 5\n1.   Relief may be granted only to persons whose normal place of residence has been outside the customs territory of the Community for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\n2.   However, the competent authorities may grant exceptions to the rule in paragraph 1, provided that the intention of the person concerned was clearly to reside outside the customs territory of the Community for a continuous period of at least 12 months.\nArticle 6\nNo relief shall be granted for:\n(a)\nalcoholic products;\n(b)\ntobacco or tobacco products;\n(c)\ncommercial means of transport;\n(d)\narticles for use in the exercise of a trade or profession, other than portable instruments of the applied or liberal arts.\nArticle 7\n1.

Any loan, giving as security, hiring out or transfer before the expiry of the period referred to in paragraph 1 shall entail payment of the relevant import duties on the property concerned, at the rate applying on the date of such loan, giving as security, hiring out or transfer, on the basis of the type of property and the customs value ascertained or accepted on that date by the competent authorities.\nArticle 9\n1.   By way of derogation from the first paragraph of Article 7, relief may be granted in respect of personal property entered for free circulation before the person concerned establishes his normal place of residence in the customs territory of the Community, provided that he undertakes actually to establish his normal place of residence there within a period of six months. Such undertaking shall be accompanied by a security, the form and amount of which shall be determined by the competent authorities.\n2.

Where, owing to occupational commitments, the person concerned leaves the third country where he had his normal place of residence without simultaneously establishing his normal place of residence in the customs territory of the Community, although having the intention of ultimately doing so, the competent authorities may authorise duty-free admission of the personal property which he transfers into the said territory for this purpose.\n2.   Duty-free admission of the personal property referred to in paragraph 1 shall be granted in accordance with the conditions laid down in Articles 3 to 8, on the understanding that:\n(a)\nthe periods laid down in Article 4(a) and the first paragraph of Article 7 shall be calculated from the date on which the personal property is brought into the customs territory of the Community;\n(b)\nthe period referred to in Article 8(1) shall be calculated from the date when the person concerned actually establishes his normal place of residence in the customs territory of the Community.\n3.   Duty-free admission shall also be subject to an undertaking from the person concerned that he will actually establish his normal place of residence in the customs territory of the Community within a period laid down by the competent authorities in keeping with the circumstances. The latter may require this undertaking to be accompanied by a security, the form and amount of which they shall determine.\nArticle 11\nThe competent authorities may derogate from Article 4(a) and (b), Article 6(c) and (d) and Article 8, when a person has to transfer his normal place of residence from a third country to the customs territory of the Community as a result of exceptional political circumstances.\nCHAPTER II\nGoods imported on the occasion of a marriage\nArticle 12\n1.   Subject to Articles 13 to 16, trousseaux and household effects, whether or not new, belonging to a person transferring his or her normal place of residence from a third country to the customs territory of the Community on the occasion of his or her marriage, shall be admitted free of import duties.\n2.   Subject to the same conditions, presents customarily given on the occasion of a marriage, which are received by a person fulfilling the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 from persons having their normal place of residence in a third country shall also be admitted free of import duties. The value of each present admitted duty-free may not, however, exceed EUR 1 000.\nArticle 13\nThe relief referred to in Article 12 may be granted only to persons:\n(a)\nwhose normal place of residence has been outside the customs territory of the Community for a continuous period of at least 12 months.

relief system\nEU customs relief system\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 1186/2009 setting up an EU system of reliefs from customs duty\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt allows for the granting of relief from the duties that would normally be payable on goods both imported into and exported out of the EU.\nIt sets out the cases in which relief from import and export duties and measures adopted on the basis of Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (ex-Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community) are granted when goods are imported into or exported out of the EU.\nKEY POINTS\nRelief from import duties\nThere are various categories of goods which are eligible for relief from import duties. Subject to certain conditions, goods are free from import duties when they concern:\nPersonal property:\npersonal property of people transferring their normal place of residence from a non-EU country to an EU country, provided that the place of residence had been outside of the EU for at least 12 consecutive months;\ngoods imported on the occasion of a marriage, provided that the person concerned has been resident outside of the EU for at least 12 consecutive months and can provide proof of marriage;\npersonal property inherited by an EU resident;\nclothing, study materials and furniture of students coming to study in the EU.\nGoods of negligible value, non-commercial goods, capital goods and goods contained in travellers' personal luggage:\ngoods of negligible value;\ngoods of a non-commercial nature, sent directly from one private individual in a non-EU country to another in the EU;\ncapital goods and other equipment belonging to an undertaking that has definitively terminated its activities in a non-EU country and has moved to the EU;\nVAT-exempt goods contained in the personal luggage of travellers arriving from outside the EU.\nAgricultural, biological, chemical, pharmaceutical and medical products:\nagricultural, stock-farming, bee-keeping, horticultural and forestry products from properties in adjoining non-EU countries operated by EU farmers;\nseeds, fertilisers and products for treatment of soil and crops imported by agricultural producers from non-EU countries, but intended for use in the adjoining EU countries;\nlaboratory animals and biological or chemical substances intended for research;\ntherapeutic substances of human origin and blood-grouping and tissue-typing reagents;\ninstruments and apparatus used in medical research, diagnosis or treatment;\nreference substances for the quality control of medicinal products;\npharmaceutical products used at international sports events.\nOther categories:\neducational, scientific and cultural materials and scientific instruments and apparatus;\ngoods for charitable or philanthropic organisations (see also below);\nhonorary decorations or awards, gifts received in the context of international relations and goods to be used by monarchs or heads of state;\ngoods imported for trade promotion purposes;\ntrademarks, patterns or designs sent to organisations protecting copyrights or industrial and commercial patent rights;\ntourist information literature;\nancillary materials used for the stowage and protection of goods during their transport;\nlitter, fodder and feedingstuffs accompanying animals during their transport;\nfuel and lubricants contained in motor vehicles and motor cycles entering the EU;\nmaterials for the construction or maintenance of war memorials;\ncoffins containing bodies, funerary urns containing ashes, and ornamental funerary articles.\nWhere relief from import duties is subject to the goods being put to a particular use, the person concerned is responsible for providing the competent authority with proof that these conditions have been met. In this situation, only the competent authorities of the EU country concerned may grant this relief.\nRelief from export duties\nThere are various categories of goods which are eligible for relief from export duties. Subject to certain conditions, goods are free from export duties when they concern:\ngoods of negligible value;\ndomesticated animals exported when an agricultural undertaking transfers its activities from an EU to a non-EU country;\nagricultural or stock-farming products obtained by non-EU farmers in adjoining countries;\nseeds exported by agricultural producers for use on properties in non-EU countries;\nfodder and feedingstuffs accompanying animals during their exportation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2010.\nRELIEF FROM IMPORT DUTIES AND VAT\n              \nIn March 2020, EU countries requested relief from import duties and exemption from VAT on the import of goods needed to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak. Since the pandemic and the extreme challenges it poses constitute a disaster within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009, the European Commission adopted Decision (EU) 2020/491 permitting the import of these goods free of import duties. It applies to imports made from 30 January 2020 to 31 December 2021.\nOther relief from import duties\nItaly:\n2009: Decision 2010/214/EU in favour of the victims of the earthquake of April 2009\n2012: Decision 2012/746/EU in favour of the victims of the earthquakes of May 2012\n2017: Decision (EU) 2017/1003 in favour of the victims of the earthquake of August and October 2016\nPoland:\n2010: Decision 2010/586/EU in favour of the victims of the floods of May 2010\nHungary:\n2010: Decision 2010/760/EU in favour of the victims of floods of spring 2010.\nFor more information, see:\nDuty relief (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 of 16 November 2009 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty (OJ L 324, 10.12.2009, pp. 23-57)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Decision (EU) 2020/491 of 3 April 2020 on relief from import duties and VAT exemption on importation granted for goods needed to combat the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak during 2020 (OJ L 103I, 3.4.2020, pp. 1-3)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision (EU) 2020/491 have been incorporated into the original text.
