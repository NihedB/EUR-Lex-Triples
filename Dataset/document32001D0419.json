A system should therefore be created at European Union level to allow for the legal transmission of such samples. Such system should apply to all forms of transmission of samples of seized controlled substances between Member States. Transmission should be based on agreement between the sending and the receiving Member State.(4) Transmission should take place in a manner that is secure and guarantees that the transported samples cannot be abused,HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:Article 1Establishment of a system for the transmission of samples1.

The national contact points shall, if appropriate in association with other relevant national bodies, be the sole bodies competent for authorising the transmission of samples under this Decision, notwithstanding relevant provisions on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.Article 4Agreement to transmit samples and acknowledgement of receipt1. The national contact point of the Member State intending to send a sample and the national contact point of the Member State intended to receive a sample shall agree on the transport before the transmission takes place. For this purpose they shall make use of the Sample Transmission Form set out in the Annex.2. Where transmission of a sample involves transportation through the territory of another Member State (hereinafter referred as \"transit Member State\"), the national contact point of such a transit Member State shall subsequently be informed of the planned transport by the national contact point of the sending Member State. To that end, each transit Member State shall receive a copy of the duly completed Sample Transmission Form before the transmission begins.3. The receiving Member State shall acknowledge to the sending Member State the receipt of the sample.Article 5Means of transport1. Transport of samples shall take place in a secure way.2.

In case of doubts as to the legal status of the Sample Transmission Form, the national contact point of the Member State detaining the transport shall, without delay, contact the national contact points of the Member States responsible for the completion of the Sample Transmission Form in order to clarify the issue.5. If the means of transport chosen is transport by an official of the sending or receiving Member State, that official shall not be permitted to wear a uniform. Further, he or she shall not carry out any operational tasks in connection with the transport unless this would be compatible with the applicable national legislation and agreed upon by the sending, transit or receiving Member States. When travelling by aircraft, only airline companies registered in one of the Member States shall be used.Article 6Quantity of the sample and its use1. A sample shall not exceed the quantity deemed necessary for law enforcement and judicial purposes or for the analysis of samples.2. The use of the sample within the receiving Member State shall be agreed between the sending and receiving Member States, it being understood that samples can be used for detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or for the forensic analysis of samples.Article 7Evaluation1.
