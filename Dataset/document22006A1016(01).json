The consultations provided for in paragraph 1 shall be held within one month of the request and in urgent cases as soon as possible.Article 251. The main aims of the consultations provided for in Article 24(1)(a) shall be:(a) to determine jointly whether the questions raise problems of common interest; and(b) depending upon the nature of such problems:- to consider jointly whether the Contracting Parties' action within the international organisations concerned should be coordinated, or- to consider jointly any other approach which might be appropriate.2.

A dispute between an Associated Party and another Contracting Party as to whether the provisions of the Protocol with respect to the Associated Party concerned or the bilateral agreements and/or arrangements are, in view of the full application of the ECAA, more flexible shall be settled in the framework of the dispute settlement mechanism provided for in Article 20. Disputes on how to determine the relationship between conflicting Protocols shall be settled in the same way.ENTRY INTO FORCE, REVIEW, TERMINATION AND OTHER PROVISIONSArticle 29Entry into force1.

If this Agreement is denounced by any other Contracting Party it shall cease to be in force only with respect to such Contracting Party one year after the date of notification. However, air services operated at the date of expiry of this Agreement may continue until the end of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) scheduling season into which that date of expiry falls.2. Upon accession to the European Union of an Associated Party, that Party shall automatically cease to be an Associated Party under this Agreement and shall instead become an EC Member State.3. This Agreement shall cease to be in force or be suspended with respect to an Associated Party if the corresponding Association Agreement ceases to be in force or is suspended.Article 32Enlargement of the ECAAThe European Community may ask any State or entity which is prepared to make its laws on air transport and associated matters compatible with those of the Community, and with which the Community has established or is establishing a framework of close economic cooperation, such as an Association Agreement, to participate in the ECAA.
