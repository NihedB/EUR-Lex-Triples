The Contracting Parties taking into account the proposals from the International Commission shall set emission limits applicable to individual industrial sectors or industries in terms of pollution loads and concentrations and based in the best possible way on low- and non-waste technologies at source. Where hazardous substances are discharged, the emission limits shall be based on the best available techniques for the abatement at source and/or for waste water purification. For municipal waste water, emission limits shall be based on the application of at least biological or an equivalent level of treatment.\n2.   Supplementary provisions for preventing or reducing the release of hazardous substances and nutrients shall be developed by the Contracting Parties for non-point sources, in particular where the main sources are originating from agriculture, taking into account the best environmental practice.\n3.   For the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 Annex II to this Convention contains a list of industrial sectors and industries as well as an additional list of hazardous substances and groups of substances, the discharge of which from point and non-point sources shall be prevented or considerably reduced. The updating of Annex II lies with the International Commission.\n4.   The Contracting Parties in addition shall, where appropriate, define water quality objectives and apply water quality criteria for the purpose of preventing, controlling and reducing transboundary impact. General guidance for this is given in Annex III, which shall be applied and specified by the Contracting Parties both, at the domestic level and jointly, where appropriate.\n5.   Aiming at an efficient limitation of the emissions in areas under their jurisdiction the Contracting Parties shall ensure necessary preconditions and implementation.\nThey shall ensure that:\n(a)\nthe domestic regulations for emission limitation and their level of standards imposed are harmonized step by step with the emission limitation pursuant to this Convention;\n(b)\nwaste water discharges without exception are based on a permit imposed by the competent authorities in advance and for a limited period of validity;\n(c)\nregulations and permits for prevention and control measures in case of new or modernized industrial facilities, in particular where hazardous substances are involved, are oriented on the best available techniques and are implemented with high priority;\n(d)\nmore stringent provisions than the standards — in individual cases even prohibition — are imposed, where the character of the receiving water and of its ecosystem so requires in connection with paragraph 4;\n(e)\ncompetent authorities survey that activities likely to cause transboundary impacts are carried out in compliance with the permits and provisions imposed;\n(f)\nenvironmental impact assessment in line with supranational and international regulations or other procedures for evaluation and assessment of environmental effects are applied;\n(g)\nwhen planning, licensing and implementing activities and measures as referred to in Article 3 (2) and in Article 16 (2) the competent authorities take into account risks of accidents involving substances hazardous to water by imposing preventive measures and by ordering rules of conduct for post-accident response measures.\nArticle 8\nEmission inventories, action programmes and progress reviews\n1.   The Contracting Parties shall undertake periodically inventories of the relevant point and non-point sources of pollution within the catchment are of river Danube including the prevention and abatement measures already taken for the respective discharges as well as on the actual efficiency of these measures, taking duly into account Article 5 (2) (a).\n2.   Based on that the Contracting Parties shall in stages establish a list of further prevention and abatement measures to be taken step by step as far as this is necessary for reaching the objectives of this Convention.\n3.   The inventory of emissions and the list of measures to be taken form the basis for developing joint action programmes to be developed by the Contracting Parties taking into account priorities set in terms of urgency and efficiency. These action programmes in particular shall be aimed at the reduction of pollution loads and concentrations both from industrial and municipal point sources as well as from non-point sources. They shall inter alia contain the prevention and abatement measures including the timing and cost estimates.\n4.   In addition the Contracting Parties shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the joint action programmes by establishing periodical progress reviews. These reviews shall contain both, the protection measures implemented and the progress made as to the riverine conditions in the light of the actual assessment.\nArticle 9\nMonitoring programmes\nOn the basis of their domestic activities, the Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the field of monitoring and assessment.\n1.\nFor this aim, they shall:\n—\nharmonize or make comparable their monitoring and assessment methods as applied on their domestic levels, in particular in the field of river quality, emission control, flood forecast and water belance, with a view to achieving comparable results to be introduced into the joint monitoring and assessment activities,\n—\ndevelop concerted or joint monitoring systems applying stationary or mobile measurement devices, communication and data processing facilities,\n—\nelaborate and implement joint programmes for monitoring the riverine conditions in the Danube catchment area concerning both water quality and quantity, sediments and riverine ecosystems, as a basis for the assessment of transboundary impacts such as transboundary pollution and changes of the riverine regimes as well as of water balances, flood and ice-hazards,\n—\ndevelop joint or harmonized methods for monitoring and assessment of waste water discharges including processing, evaluation and documentation of data taking into account the branch-specific approach of emission limitation (Annex II, Part 1),\n—\nelaborate inventories on relevant point sources including the pollutants discharged (emission inventories) and estimate the water pollution from non-point sources taking into account Annex II, Part 2; review these documents according to the actual state.\n2.\nIn particular they shall agree upon monitoring points, river quality characteristics and pollution parameters regularly to be evaluated for the river Danube with a sufficient frequency taking into account the ecological and hydrological character of the watercourse concerned as well as typical emissions of pollutants discharged within the respective catchment area.\n3.\nThe Contracting Parties shall establish, on the basis of a harmonized methodology, domestic water balances, as well as the general water balance of the river Danube basin.
