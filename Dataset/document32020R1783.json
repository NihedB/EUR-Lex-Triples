{"celex_id": "32020R1783", "reference": "2.12.2020\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 405/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2020/1783 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 25 November 2020\non cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters (taking of evidence)\n(recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 (3) has been amended before. Since further substantial amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nThe Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is ensured. To establish such an area, the Union is to adopt, among other measures, measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters needed for the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(3)\nFor the purposes of the proper functioning of the internal market and the development of an area of civil justice in the Union, it is necessary to further improve and expedite cooperation between the courts of the different Member States in relation to the taking of evidence. This Regulation seeks to improve the effectiveness and speed of judicial proceedings by simplifying and streamlining the mechanisms for cooperation in the taking of evidence in cross-border proceedings, while at the same time helping to reduce delays and costs for individuals and businesses. Providing greater legal certainty and simpler, streamlined and digitalised procedures will encourage individuals and businesses to engage in cross-border transactions, thereby boosting trade within the Union and thus the functioning of the internal market.\n(4)\nThis Regulation lays down rules on cooperation between the courts of the different Member States in relation to the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.\n(5)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘court’ should also be understood to mean authorities that exercise judicial functions, that act pursuant to a delegation of power by a judicial authority or that act under the control of a judicial authority, and that are competent under national law to take evidence for the purposes of judicial proceedings in civil or commercial matters. This includes in particular authorities that qualify as courts under other Union legal acts, such as Council Regulation (EU) 2019/1111 (4) and Regulations (EU) No 1215/2012 (5) and (EU) No 650/2012 (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n(6)\nTo ensure the utmost clarity and legal certainty, the request for the taking of evidence should be transmitted on a form completed in the language of the Member State of the requested court or in another language accepted by that Member State. For the same reasons, forms should also be used as much as possible for further communication between the relevant courts.\n(7)\nIn order to ensure speedy transmission of requests and communications between Member States for the purposes of taking of evidence, any appropriate modern communications technology should be used. Therefore, as a rule, all communication and exchange of documents should be carried out through a secure and reliable decentralised IT system comprising national IT systems that are interconnected and technically interoperable, for example, and without prejudice to further technological progress, based on e-CODEX. Accordingly, a decentralised IT system should be established for data exchanges under this Regulation. The decentralised nature of that IT system would enable data exchanges exclusively between one Member State and another, without any of the Union institutions being involved in those exchanges.\n(8)\nWithout prejudice to possible future technological progress, the secure decentralised IT system and its components should not be understood to necessarily constitute a qualified electronic registered delivery service as defined by Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(9)\nThe Commission should be responsible for the creation, maintenance and future development of reference implementation software which Member States should be able to use instead of a national IT system, in accordance with the principles of data protection by design and by default. The Commission should design, develop and maintain the reference implementation software in compliance with the data protection requirements and principles laid down in Regulations (EU) 2018/1725 (8) and (EU) 2016/679 (9) of the European Parliament and of the Council, in particular the principles of data protection by design and by default. The reference implementation software should also include appropriate technical measures and enable the organisational measures necessary for ensuring a level of security and interoperability which is appropriate for the exchange of information in the context of the taking of evidence.\n(10)\nIn relation to the components of the decentralised IT system which are under the responsibility of the Union, the managing entity should have sufficient resources in order to ensure the proper functioning of that system.\n(11)\nThe competent authority or authorities under national law should be responsible as controllers within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in relation to the processing of personal data that they carry out under this Regulation for the transmission of requests and other communications between Member States.\n(12)\nTransmission through the decentralised IT system could become impossible due to a disruption of the system or the nature of the evidence, for example when transmitting DNA or blood samples. Other means of communication could be more appropriate also in exceptional circumstances, which could include situations in which converting voluminous documentation into electronic form would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on the competent authorities or whereby the original document is needed in paper format to assess its authenticity. Where the decentralised IT system is not used, transmission should be carried out by the most appropriate alternative means. Such alternative means should entail, inter alia, transmission being performed as swiftly as possible and in a secure manner by other secure electronic means or by postal service.\n(13)\nIn order to enhance electronic cross-border transmission of documents through the decentralised IT system, such documents should not be denied legal effect and should not be considered inadmissible as evidence in the proceedings solely on the grounds that they are in electronic form. However, that principle should be without prejudice to the assessment of the legal effects or the admissibility of such documents as evidence in accordance with national law. It should also be without prejudice to national law regarding the conversion of documents.\n(14)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to the ability of authorities to exchange information under systems established under other Union instruments, such as Regulation (EU) 2019/1111 or Council Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 (10), even where that information has evidentiary value, thus leaving the choice of the most appropriate method to the requesting authority.\n(15)\nRequests for the taking of evidence should be executed expeditiously. If it is not possible for a request to be executed within 90 days of its receipt by the requested court, the requested court should inform the requesting court accordingly, stating the reasons which prevent it from executing the request swiftly.\n(16)\nTo ensure that this Regulation is effective, the circumstances in which it is possible to refuse to execute a request for the taking of evidence should be confined to strictly limited exceptional situations.\n(17)\nThe requested court should execute a request for the taking of evidence in accordance with its national law.\n(18)\nThe parties to the proceedings and their representatives, if any, should be able to be present at the taking of evidence, if that is provided for by the law of the Member State of the requesting court, in order to be able to follow the proceedings in a comparable way as if evidence were taken in the Member State of the requesting court. They should also have the right to request to participate in the taking of evidence in order to have a more active role in the taking of evidence. However, the conditions under which they may participate should be determined by the requested court in accordance with its national law.\n(19)\nThe representatives of the requesting court should be able to be present at the taking of evidence, if that is compatible with the law of the Member State of the requesting court, in order to be in a better position to evaluate the evidence. They should also have the right to request to participate in the taking of evidence, under the conditions laid down by the requested court in accordance with its national law, in order to have a more active role in the taking of evidence.\n(20)\nIn order to facilitate the taking of evidence, it should be possible for a court of a Member State, in accordance with its national law, to take evidence directly in another Member State, if the request for direct taking of evidence is accepted by the latter, and under the conditions determined by the central body or competent authority of the requested Member State.\n(21)\nModern communications technology, for example videoconferencing, which is an important means of simplifying and accelerating the taking of evidence, is currently not used to its full potential. Where evidence is to be taken by examining a person such as a witness, a party to the proceedings or an expert present in another Member State, the requesting court should take that evidence directly using videoconferencing or other distance communications technology, where that technology is available to the court and the court considers the use of such technology to be appropriate with regard to the specific circumstances of the case and the fair conduct of the proceedings. Videoconferencing could also be used to hear a child as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1111. However, where the central body or competent authority of the requested Member State deems certain conditions to be necessary, direct taking of evidence should be done under those conditions in accordance with the law of that Member State. The central body or competent authority of the requested Member State should be able to refuse the direct taking of evidence wholly or partially, if such direct taking of evidence would be contrary to fundamental principles of the law of that Member State.\n(22)\nWhere evidence is to be taken by examining a person using videoconferencing or other distance communications technology, the requesting court, upon its request, should be provided with assistance in finding an interpreter, including in finding a certified interpreter where specifically requested.\n(23)\nThe court seised of the proceedings should provide the parties and their legal representatives with instructions as to the procedure for presenting documents or other material when the examinations are conducted using videoconferencing or other appropriate distance communications technology.\n(24)\nIn order to facilitate the taking of evidence by diplomatic agents or consular officers, such persons should be able to, in the territory of another Member State and within the area in which they are accredited, take evidence without the need for a prior request, by hearing, without the use of coercive measures, nationals of the Member State which they represent, in the context of proceedings pending in the courts of the Member State which they represent. However, it should be left to the discretion of the Member State whether its diplomatic agents or consular officers have the power to take evidence as part of their functions.\n(25)\nThe taking of evidence by diplomatic agents or consular officers should take place at the premises of the diplomatic mission or consulate except in exceptional circumstances. Such circumstances could include the fact that the person to be heard is unable to come to the premises because of a serious illness.\n(26)\nThe execution of a request for evidence to be taken in accordance with this Regulation should not give rise to a claim for reimbursement of taxes or costs. Nevertheless, if the requested court requires reimbursement, the fees paid to experts and interpreters, as well as the costs occasioned by execution in accordance with a special procedure provided for by national law or by the use of distance communications technology, should not be borne by that court. In such a case, the requesting court should take the necessary measures to ensure reimbursement without delay. Where the opinion of an expert is required, the requested court should be able, before executing the request, to ask the requesting court for an adequate deposit or advance towards the costs.\n(27)\nIn order to update the forms in Annex I to this Regulation or to make technical changes to those forms, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to that Annex. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (11). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(28)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(29)\nThis Regulation should prevail over the provisions contained in bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements concluded by the Member States that have the same scope of application as this Regulation. This Regulation does not preclude Member States from maintaining or concluding agreements or arrangements to further facilitate cooperation in the taking of evidence, provided that those agreements or arrangements are compatible with this Regulation.\n(30)\nIt is essential that effective means of obtaining, preserving and presenting evidence are available and that rights of defence are respected and confidential information is protected. In this context, it is important to encourage the use of modern technology.\n(31)\nThe procedures for taking, preserving and presenting evidence should ensure that procedural rights, as well as privacy and the integrity and confidentiality of personal data, are protected in accordance with Union and national law.\n(32)\nIt is important to ensure that this Regulation is applied in compliance with Union data protection law and that the application of this Regulation respects the protection of privacy as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is also important to ensure that any processing of personal data under this Regulation is undertaken in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), as well as Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Personal data should be processed under this Regulation only for the specific purposes set out herein.\n(33)\nIn accordance with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making, the Commission should evaluate this Regulation on the basis of information collected through specific monitoring arrangements in order to assess the actual effects of this Regulation and the need for any further action. Where Member States collect data on the numbers of requests transmitted and requests executed, as well as the number of cases in which transmission was performed by means other than through the decentralised IT system, they should provide the Commission with such data for monitoring purposes. The reference implementation software developed by the Commission as a back-end system should programmatically collect the data necessary for monitoring purposes and such data should be transmitted to the Commission. Where Member States choose to use a national IT system instead of the reference implementation software developed by the Commission that system may be equipped to programmatically collect those data and in that case those data should be transmitted to the Commission.\n(34)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the creation of a simplified legal framework ensuring the direct, effective and speedy transmission of requests and communications concerning the taking of evidence, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(35)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an opinion on 13 September 2019 (14).\n(36)\nIn order to make its provisions more easily accessible and readable, Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(37)\nIn accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland has notified its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(38)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

The requested court shall execute the request in accordance with its national law.\n3.   The requesting court may call for the request to be executed in accordance with a special procedure provided for in its national law, using form A in Annex I. The requested court shall execute the request in accordance with the special procedure unless doing so would be incompatible with its national law or it is unable to do so because of major practical difficulties. If the requested court does not comply with the call for the request to be executed in accordance with a special procedure for one of those reasons, it shall inform the requesting court using form H in Annex I.\n4.   The requesting court may ask the requested court to use specific communications technology in the taking of evidence, in particular by using videoconferencing or teleconferencing.\nThe requested court shall use the communications technology specified pursuant to the first subparagraph unless doing so would be incompatible with its national law or the requested court is unable to do so because of major practical difficulties.\nIf the requested court does not use the specified communications technology for one of those reasons, it shall inform the requesting court using form H in Annex I.\nIf the communications technology referred to in the first subparagraph is not available in the requesting or in the requested court, those courts may make such communications technology available by mutual agreement.\nArticle 13\nTaking of evidence with the presence and participation of the parties\n1.   If the law of the Member State of the requesting court so provides, the parties and their representatives, if any, shall have the right to be present at the taking of evidence by the requested court.\n2.   In its request, the requesting court shall inform the requested court, using form A in Annex I, that the parties and their representatives, if any, will be present and, where appropriate, that their participation in the taking of evidence is requested. This information may also be given at any other appropriate time.\n3.   If the participation of the parties and their representatives, if any, is requested in the taking of evidence, the requested court shall determine the conditions under which they may participate, in accordance with Article 12.\n4.   The requested court shall notify the parties and their representatives, if any, of the time and the place where the taking of evidence will take place and, where appropriate, of the conditions under which they may participate in the taking of evidence, using form I in Annex I.\n5.   Paragraphs 1 to 4 are without prejudice to the ability of the requested court to request the parties and their representatives, if any, to be present at or to participate in the taking of evidence if provided for by the law of its Member State.\nArticle 14\nTaking of evidence with the presence and participation of representatives of the requesting court\n1.   Where compatible with the law of the Member State of the requesting court, representatives of the requesting court shall have the right to be present in the taking of evidence by the requested court.\n2.   For the purposes of this Article, the term ‘representative’ includes judicial personnel designated by the requesting court in accordance with its national law. The requesting court may also designate any other person, such as an expert, in accordance with its national law.\n3.   In its request, the requesting court shall inform the requested court, using form A in Annex I, that its representatives will be present and, where appropriate, that their participation in the taking of evidence is requested. This information may also be given at any other appropriate time.\n4.   If the participation of the representatives of the requesting court is requested in the taking of evidence, the requested court shall determine, in accordance with Article 12, the conditions under which they may participate.\n5.   The requested court shall notify the requesting court of the time and the place where the taking of evidence will take place and, where appropriate, of the conditions under which its representatives may participate in the taking of evidence, using form I in Annex I.\nArticle 15\nCoercive measures\nWhere necessary, in executing a request the requested court shall apply the appropriate coercive measures in the instances and to the extent as are provided for by the law of the Member State of the requested court for the execution of a request made for the same purpose by its national authorities or one of the parties concerned.\nArticle 16\nRefusals to execute requests\n1.   A request for the examination of a person shall not be executed where the person concerned invokes the right to refuse to give evidence or is prohibited from giving evidence:\n(a)\nunder the law of the Member State of the requested court; or\n(b)\nunder the law of the Member State of the requesting court, and such right or prohibition has been specified in the request, or, if necessary, at the instance of the requested court, has been confirmed by the requesting court.\n2.   The execution of a request may only be refused on grounds other than those referred to in paragraph 1, where one or more of the following grounds applies:\n(a)\nthe request does not fall within the scope of this Regulation;\n(b)\nthe execution of the request does not fall within the functions of the judiciary under the law of the Member State of the requested court;\n(c)\nthe requesting court does not comply with the request of the requested court to complete the request for the taking of evidence pursuant to Article 10 within 30 days of the requested court asking it to do so; or\n(d)\na deposit or advance asked for in accordance with Article 22(3) is not made within 60 days of the requested court asking for such a deposit or advance.\n3.   A requested court shall not refuse to execute a request solely on the ground that under its national law another court of that Member State has exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case or that the law of that Member State would not admit the right of action on the subject matter.\n4.   If the execution of a request is refused on one of the grounds referred to in paragraph 2, the requested court shall notify the requesting court thereof within 60 days of receipt of the request by the requested court using form K in Annex I.\nArticle 17\nNotification of delay\nIf the requested court is not in a position to execute the request within 90 days of receipt of the request, it shall inform the requesting court thereof using form J in Annex I. When it does so, it shall give the grounds for the delay as well as the estimated time it expects it will need to execute the request.\nArticle 18\nProcedure after the execution of the request\nThe requested court shall send to the requesting court the documents confirming the execution of the request, without delay and, where appropriate, shall return the documents received from the requesting court. Those documents shall be accompanied by a confirmation of execution using form K in Annex I.\nSECTION 4\nDirect taking of evidence by the requesting court and taking of evidence by diplomatic agents or consular officers\nArticle 19\nDirect taking of evidence by the requesting court\n1.   Where a court requests the taking of evidence directly in another Member State, it shall submit a request to the central body or to the competent authority of that Member State, using form L in Annex I.\n2.   The direct taking of evidence may only take place if it can be carried out on a voluntary basis without the use of coercive measures.\nWhere the direct taking of evidence implies that a person has to be examined, the requesting court shall inform that person that the taking of evidence shall take place on a voluntary basis.\n3.   The direct taking of evidence shall be carried out by a member of the judicial personnel or by any other person, such as an expert, who is designated in accordance with the law of the Member State of the requesting court.\n4.   Within 30 days of receiving the request for the direct taking of evidence, the central body or the competent authority of the requested Member State shall inform the requesting court as to whether the request has been accepted and, if necessary, shall inform the requesting court of the conditions under which the direct taking of evidence is to be carried out according to the law of its Member State, using form M in Annex I.\nThe central body or the competent authority may assign a court of its Member State to take part in the direct taking of evidence in order to ensure that this Article is properly applied and that the conditions under which the direct taking of evidence is to be carried out are complied with.\n5.   Where the requesting court has not received information within 30 days of acknowledgement of receipt of the request for the direct taking of evidence as to whether the request has been accepted, it may send a reminder to the central body or competent authority of the requested Member State. If the requesting court does not receive a reply within 15 days of the acknowledgement of receipt of the reminder, the request for the direct taking of evidence shall be considered accepted. However, in extraordinary circumstances where the central body or competent authority was prevented from reacting to the request within the deadline following the reminder, grounds for the refusal of direct taking of evidence may exceptionally still be invoked at any time after the expiration of that deadline until the moment of the actual direct taking of evidence.\n6.   The central body or the competent authority of the requested Member State may assign a court of its Member State to provide practical assistance in the direct taking of evidence.\n7.   The central body or the competent authority of the requested Member State may refuse a request for direct taking of evidence only if:\n(a)\nit does not fall within the scope of this Regulation;\n(b)\nit does not contain all of the necessary information referred to in Article 5; or\n(c)\nthe direct taking of evidence requested is contrary to fundamental principles of law in its Member State.\n8.

matters\nTaking of evidence in civil and commercial matters\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2020/1783 on cooperation between the courts of the EU countries in taking evidence in civil or commercial matters\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt aims to improve the effectiveness and speed of cross-border judicial proceedings in civil and commercial cases by simplifying and streamlining procedures for taking evidence.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation applies in civil and commercial matters when a court* (‘requesting court’) either asks a court in another EU country (‘requested court’) to take evidence or wishes to do so directly itself.\nRequests to obtain evidence are:\nused only in judicial proceedings already underway or being considered;\nsubmitted, in an official EU language, on a standard form containing all the necessary details;\ntransmitted through a secure and reliable decentralised IT system that respects fundamental rights and freedoms;\nacknowledged to have been received within 7 days by the court;\nprocessed under different deadlines if the request is incomplete or the requested court does not have the necessary jurisdiction.\nA court requested to take evidence:\nacts without delay and, at the latest, within 90 days;\nmay use video- or tele-conferencing if asked to do so by the requesting court and its national law allows it;\nallows the parties and their representatives, including those of the requesting court, to attend when evidence is taken if that right exists in the country of the requesting court;\nmay reject the request if: the person to be examined invokes the right to refuse to give evidence or is banned by law from doing so,the application does not comply with the regulation or is outside the court’s competence,the requesting court does not provide any additional information required or a deposit within the necessary deadlines.\nA court looking to take evidence itself directly in another EU country:\ncontacts the country’s central body or competent authority which within 30 days accepts or rejects the request and may attach conditions and assign a particular court;\nmay use video-conferencing or another form of distance communication to question the person concerned.\nIn general, a court asked to take evidence may not claim reimbursement from the requesting court for taxes or costs, but may do so to cover:\nfees for experts and interpreters, including a deposit or an advance towards the likely costs of the former;\nthe expense of video- or tele-conferencing.\nEU countries:\ndesignate a central body to: supply information to courts,sort out any difficulties that may arise,forward, in exceptional cases, requests to the competent court;\nprovide the European Commission with practical information, such as the details of the central bodies and competent authorities;\ncover the costs of installing, operating and maintaining the national IT systems used.\nThe Commission:\ndraws up and updates an electronic manual of practical information it receives from national authorities;\nmay adopt delegated and implementing acts on technical aspects of the legislation;\nis responsible for creating, maintaining, developing and financing software that national authorities may use instead of their national IT system;\nestablishes, by 2 July 2023, a detailed programme to monitor the output, results and impact of the regulation;\nsubmits an evaluation report to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee.\nThe regulation does not apply in Denmark.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) 2020/1783 repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 (see summary).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 1 July 2022.\nRegulation (EU) 2020/1783 revises and replaces Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 (and its subsequent amendments), notably through the use of digitalisation and modern technology to speed up processes and reduce costs and delays for individuals and businesses.\nBACKGROUND\nJudicial civil procedures cover matters such as contracts, property, succession and family and company law. By 2018, some 3.4 million civil and commercial court cases involved more than one EU country.\nFor more information, see: What is civil justice cooperation? (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCourt: any national authority that may take evidence (i.e. not only judicial bodies).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2020/1783 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2020 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters (taking of evidence) (recast) (OJ L 405, 2.12.2020, pp. 1-39)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters (OJ L 174, 27.6.2001, pp. 1-24)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 have been incorporated into the original text.
