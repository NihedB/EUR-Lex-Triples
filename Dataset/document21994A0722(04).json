Ownership, allocation and exercise of rights\n1.\nAll research carried out pursuant to this Agreement shall be ‘joint research’. The participants shall jointly develop joint technology management plans (TMPs) (1) in respect of the ownership and use, including publication, of information and intellectual property (IP) to be created in the course of joint research. Those plans shall be approved by the Parties before the conclusion of any specific research and development cooperation contracts to which they refer. The TMPs shall be developed taking into account the aims of the joint research, the relative contributions of the participants, the advantages and disadvantages of licensing by territory or for fields of use, requirements imposed by applicable laws, dispute settlement procedures, and other factors deemed appropriate by the participants. The rights and obligations concerning the research generated by visiting researchers in respect of IP shall also be addressed in the TMPs.\n2.\nInformation or IP created in the course of joint research and not addressed in the TMP shall be allocated, with the approval of the Parties, according to the principles set out in the TMP, including dispute resolution. In case of disagreement which for sound reasons cannot be resolved by the agreed dispute sttlement procedure, the dispute may be referred to the Joint Science and Technology Cooperation Committee which shall endeavour to mediate between the participants. If, having exhausted the procedures described above, the disagreement continues, such information or IP shall be owned jointly by all the participants involved in the joint research from which the information or IP results. Each participant to whom this provision applies shall have the right to use such information or IP for his own commercial exploitation with no geographical limitation.\n3.\nEach Party shall ensure that the other Party and its participants may have the rights to IP allocated in accordance with the principles set out in Section I of this Annex.\n4.\nWhile maintaining the conditions of competition in areas affected by the Agreement, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that rights acquired pursuant to this Agreement and arrangements made under it are exercised in such a way as to encourage in particular:\n(i)\nthe dissemination and use of information created, disclosed, or otherwise made available, under the Agreement; and\n(ii)\nthe adoption and implementation of international standards.\nII.   Copyright works\nCopyright belonging to the Parties or to their participants shall be accorded treatment consistent with the Berne Convention (Paris Act 1971).\nIII.   Scientific literary works\nSubject to Section IV, unless otherwise agreed in the TMP, publication of results of research shall be made jointly by the Parties or participants to that joint research. Subject to this general rule, the following procedures shall apply:\n(1)\nIn the case of publication by a Party or public bodies of that Party of scientific and technical journals, articles, reports, books, including video and software, arising from joint research pursuant to this Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled to a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to translate, reproduce, adapt, transmit and publicly distribute such works.\n(2)\nThe Parties shall ensure that literary works of a scientific character arising from joint research pursuant to this Agreement and published by independent publishers shall be disseminated as widely as possible.\n(3)\nAll copies of a copyright work to be publicly distributed and prepared under this provision shall indicate the names of the author or authors of the work unless an author or authors expressly declines or decline to be named. Copies shall also bear a clearly visible acknowledgement of the cooperative support of the Parties.\nIV.   Undisclosed information\nA.

This also applies to any reproduction of the said information, in whole or in part.\n3.\nA Party receiving undisclosed information pursuant to this Agreement shall respect its privileged nature. These limitations shall automatically terminate when this information is disclosed by the owner without restriction to experts in the field.\n4.\nUndisclosed information communicated under this Agreement may be disseminated by the receiving Party to persons within or employed by the receiving Party, and other concerned departments or agencies in the receiving Party authorized for the specific purposes of the joint research under way, provided that any such undisclosed information shall be disseminated only on conditions of confidentiality and shall be readily recognizable a such, as set out above.\n5.\nWith the prior written consent of the Party providing undisclosed information under this Agreement, the receiving Party may disseminate such undisclosed information more widely than otherwise permitted in Paragraph 4 above. The Parties shall cooperate in developing procedures for requesting and obtaining prior written consent for such wider dissemination, and each Party shall grant such approval to the extent permitted by its domestic policies, regulations and laws.\nB.   Non-documentary undisclosed information\nNon-documentary undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information provided in seminars and other meetings arranged under this Agreement, or information arising from the attachment of staff, use of facilities, or joint projects, shall be treated by the Parties or their participants according to the principles specified for documentary information in the Agreement, provided, however, that the recipient of such undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information has been made aware of the confidential character of the information communicated at the time such communication is made.\nC.   Control\nEach Party shall endeavour to ensure that undisclosed information received by it under this Agreement shall be controlled as provided therein. If one of the Parties becomes aware that it will be, or may reasonably be expected to become, unable to meet the non-dissemination provisions of Subsections A or B above, it shall immediately inform the other Party. The Parties shall thereafter consult to define an appropriate course of action.\n(1)  The indicative features of such TMPs are set out in the Appendix.\nAppendix\nIndicative features of a Technology Management Plan (TMP)\nThe TMP is a specific agreement to be concluded btween the participants about the implementation of joint research and the respective rights and obligations of the participants. With respect to IP, the TMP will normally address, among other things, ownership, protection, user rights for research and development purposes, exploitation and dissemination, including arrangements for joint publication, the rights and obligations of visiting researchers and dispute settlement procedures. The TMP may also address foreground and background information, licensing and deliverables.\nDeclaration by the Council and the Commission\nThe Council and the Commission declare that this Agreement and any activities entered into under it will in no way affect the powers vested in the Member States to undertake bilateral activity with Australia in the field of science, technology, research and development and to conclude, where appropriate, agreemens to that end.", "summary": "Scientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Australia\nScientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Australia\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement relating to scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and Australia\nDecision 99/510/EC — conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement relating to scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and Australia\nDecision 94/457/EC — conclusion of the Agreement relating to scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and Australia\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISIONS?\n              \nThe agreement establishes a formal framework for cooperation in fields of common interest where the parties are supporting research and development activities to advance science and/or technology relevant to those fields of interest.
