{"celex_id": "32011R0211", "reference": "11.3.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 65/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 211/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 February 2011\non the citizens’ initiative\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 24 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Treaty on European Union (TEU) reinforces citizenship of the Union and enhances further the democratic functioning of the Union by providing, inter alia, that every citizen is to have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union by way of a European citizens’ initiative. That procedure affords citizens the possibility of directly approaching the Commission with a request inviting it to submit a proposal for a legal act of the Union for the purpose of implementing the Treaties similar to the right conferred on the European Parliament under Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and on the Council under Article 241 TFEU.\n(2)\nThe procedures and conditions required for the citizens’ initiative should be clear, simple, user-friendly and proportionate to the nature of the citizens’ initiative so as to encourage participation by citizens and to make the Union more accessible. They should strike a judicious balance between rights and obligations.\n(3)\nThey should also ensure that citizens of the Union are subject to similar conditions for supporting a citizens’ initiative regardless of the Member State from which they come.\n(4)\nThe Commission should, upon request, provide citizens with information and informal advice about citizens’ initiatives, notably as regards the registration criteria.\n(5)\nIt is necessary to establish the minimum number of Member States from which citizens must come. In order to ensure that a citizens’ initiative is representative of a Union interest, while ensuring that the instrument remains easy to use, that number should be set at one quarter of Member States.\n(6)\nFor that purpose, it is also appropriate to establish the minimum number of signatories coming from each of those Member States. In order to ensure similar conditions for citizens to support a citizens’ initiative, those minimum numbers should be degressively proportional. For the purpose of clarity, those minimum numbers should be set out for each Member State in an annex to this Regulation. The minimum number of signatories required in each Member State should correspond to the number of Members of the European Parliament elected in each Member State, multiplied by 750. The Commission should be empowered to amend that annex in order to reflect any modification in the composition of the European Parliament.\n(7)\nIt is appropriate to fix a minimum age for supporting a citizens’ initiative. That should be set as the age at which citizens are entitled to vote in elections to the European Parliament.\n(8)\nA minimum organised structure is needed in order to successfully carry through a citizens’ initiative. That should take the form of a citizens’ committee, composed of natural persons (organisers) coming from at least seven different Member States, in order to encourage the emergence of European-wide issues and to foster reflection on those issues. For the sake of transparency and smooth and efficient communication, the citizens’ committee should designate representatives to liaise between the citizens’ committee and the institutions of the Union throughout the procedure.\n(9)\nEntities, notably organisations which under the Treaties contribute to forming European political awareness and to expressing the will of citizens of the Union, should be able to promote a citizens’ initiative, provided that they do so with full transparency.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure coherence and transparency in relation to proposed citizens’ initiatives and to avoid a situation where signatures are being collected for a proposed citizens’ initiative which does not comply with the conditions laid down in this Regulation, it should be mandatory to register such initiatives on a website made available by the Commission prior to collecting the necessary statements of support from citizens. All proposed citizens’ initiatives that comply with the conditions laid down in this Regulation should be registered by the Commission. The Commission should deal with registration in accordance with the general principles of good administration.\n(11)\nOnce a proposed citizens’ initiative is registered, statements of support from citizens may be collected by the organisers.\n(12)\nIt is appropriate to set out the form for the statement of support in an annex to this Regulation, specifying the data required for the purposes of verification by the Member States. The Commission should be empowered to amend that annex in accordance with Article 290 TFEU, taking into account information forwarded to it by Member States.\n(13)\nWith due respect for the principle that personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected, the provision of personal data, including, where applicable, a personal identification number or a personal identification document number by signatories of a proposed citizens’ initiative is required as far as may be necessary in order to allow for the verification of statements of support by Member States, in accordance with national law and practice.\n(14)\nIn order to put modern technology to good use as a tool of participatory democracy, it is appropriate to provide for statements of support to be collected online as well as in paper form. Online collection systems should have adequate security features in place in order to ensure, inter alia, that the data are securely collected and stored. For that purpose, the Commission should set out detailed technical specifications for online collection systems.\n(15)\nIt is appropriate for Member States to verify the conformity of online collection systems with the requirements of this Regulation before statements of support are collected.\n(16)\nThe Commission should make available an open-source software incorporating the relevant technical and security features necessary in order to comply with the provisions of this Regulation as regards online collection systems.\n(17)\nIt is appropriate to ensure that statements of support for a citizens’ initiative are collected within a specific time limit. In order to ensure that proposed citizens’ initiatives remain relevant, whilst taking account of the complexity of collecting statements of support across the Union, that time limit should not be longer than 12 months from the date of registration of the proposed citizens’ initiative.\n(18)\nIt is appropriate to provide that, where a citizens’ initiative has received the necessary statements of support from signatories, each Member State should be responsible for the verification and certification of statements of support collected from signatories coming from that Member State. Taking account of the need to limit the administrative burden for Member States, they should, within a period of three months from receipt of a request for certification, carry out such verifications on the basis of appropriate checks, which may be based on random sampling, and should issue a document certifying the number of valid statements of support received.\n(19)\nOrganisers should ensure that all the relevant conditions set out in this Regulation are met prior to submitting a citizens’ initiative to the Commission.\n(20)\nThe Commission should examine a citizens’ initiative and set out its legal and political conclusions separately. It should also set out the action it intends to take in response to it, within a period of three months. In order to demonstrate that a citizens’ initiative supported by at least one million Union citizens and its possible follow-up are carefully examined, the Commission should explain in a clear, comprehensible and detailed manner the reasons for its intended action, and should likewise give its reasons if it does not intend to take any action. When the Commission has received a citizens’ initiative supported by the requisite number of signatories which fulfils the other requirements of this Regulation, the organisers should be entitled to present that initiative at a public hearing at Union level.\n(21)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (4) is fully applicable to the processing of personal data carried out in application of this Regulation. In this respect, for the sake of legal certainty, it is appropriate to clarify that the organisers of a citizens’ initiative and the competent authorities of the Member States are the data controllers within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC and to specify the maximum period within which the personal data collected for the purposes of a citizens’ initiative may be retained. In their capacity as data controllers, organisers need to take all the appropriate measures to comply with the obligations imposed by Directive 95/46/EC, in particular those relating to the lawfulness of the processing, the security of the processing activities, the provision of information and the rights of data subjects to have access to their personal data, as well as to procure the correction and erasure of their personal data.\n(22)\nThe provisions of Chapter III of Directive 95/46/EC on judicial remedies, liability and sanctions are fully applicable as regards the data processing carried out in application of this Regulation. Organisers of a citizens’ initiative should be liable in accordance with applicable national law for any damage that they cause. In addition, Member States should ensure that organisers are subject to appropriate penalties for infringements of this Regulation.\n(23)\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (5) is fully applicable to the processing of personal data carried out by the Commission in application of this Regulation.\n(24)\nIn order to address future adaptation needs, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU for the purpose of amending the Annexes to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(25)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(26)\nThis Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article 8 thereof, which states that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n(27)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted and adopted an opinion (7),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes the procedures and conditions required for a citizens’ initiative as provided for in Article 11 TEU and Article 24 TFEU.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘citizens’ initiative’ means an initiative submitted to the Commission in accordance with this Regulation, inviting the Commission, within the framework of its powers, to submit any appropriate proposal on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties, which has received the support of at least one million eligible signatories coming from at least one quarter of all Member States;\n2.\n‘signatories’ means citizens of the Union who have supported a given citizens’ initiative by completing a statement of support form for that initiative;\n3.\n‘organisers’ means natural persons forming a citizens’ committee responsible for the preparation of a citizens’ initiative and its submission to the Commission.\nArticle 3\nRequirements for organisers and for signatories\n1.

It is the first example of transnational participatory democracy.\nACT\n                  \nRegulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on the citizens’ initiative.\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?\n                     \nThe Regulation establishes the rules and procedures governing the citizens’ initiative.\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nTo ensure that support is sufficiently broad, a citizens’ initiative must be supported by 1 million citizens from at least a quarter of EU countries, which currently means seven countries. There is also a requirement for a minimum number of signatories from each of these countries, roughly proportionate to their respective populations (degressive proportionality).\nOrganising a citizens’ initiative\nTo launch an initiative, citizens must form a ‘citizens' committee’ comprising at least seven members residing in at least seven EU countries. All must be old enough to vote in European Parliament elections. The initiative must be registered on the European Commission's website. If the registration criteria set out in the regulation are fulfilled, the registration is confirmed by the Commission and the organisers have 1 year to collect signatures (statements of support).\nSigning a citizens’ initiative\nThe same voting age requirement applies to those signing the statements of support. These statements can be completed either on paper or online if organisers have set up an online collection system.\nOne million signatures. What’s next?\nThe Commission has 3 months to examine the initiative. During this time, the Commission meets with the organisers who also have the opportunity to present the initiative at a public hearing in the European Parliament. The Commission presents a formal response explaining what it intends to do and the reasons for that decision. It is not obliged to propose legislation.\nWHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?\n                     \nThis regulation applies from 1 April 2012.\nFurther information is available from the European Commission’s European Citizens’ Initiative website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nEntry into application\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU) No 211/2011\n31.3.2011\n1.4.2012\nOJ L 65, 11.3.2011, pp. 1-22\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 268/2012 of 25 January 2012 amending Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the citizens’ initiative (OJ L 89, 27.3.2012, pp. 1-2).\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 887/2013 of 11 July 2013 replacing Annexes II and III to Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the citizens’ initiative (OJ L 247, 18.9.2013, pp. 11-19).\nCommunication from the Commission on the European Citizens' Initiative: ‘Water and sanitation are a human right!
