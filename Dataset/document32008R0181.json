In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nPursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999, the Commission must lay down the practical arrangements for implementing the Community fleet capacity policy defined in the abovementioned Regulation.\n(3)\nIt is advisable to maintain the special contribution rates and equivalent tonnages laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 (4) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1102/89 (5) since they have proved effective.\n(4)\nIn order to ensure mutual financial support between the inland waterways' funds, it is advisable for the Commission, with the help of the various fund authorities, at the beginning of each year, to enter in the accounts the resources available in the reserve fund and to balance the accounts in the event of new improvement measures.\n(5)\nThe Member States concerned and the organisations representing inland waterway carriers at Community level have been consulted on the measures provided for in this Regulation,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation fixes the rate of the special contributions referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999, the ratios for the ‘old-for-new’ rule, and the practical arrangements for implementing the Community fleet capacity policy.\nArticle 2\nSpecial contributions\n1.   The special contributions for the various types and categories of vessels shall be between 70 % and 115 % of the following rates:\n(a)\nDry cargo vessels:\n(i)\nself-propelled barges: EUR 120 per tonne;\n(ii)\npushed barges: EUR 60 per tonne;\n(iii)\nlighters: EUR 43 per tonne.\n(b)\nTanker vessels:\n(i)\nself-propelled barges: EUR 216 per tonne;\n(ii)\npushed barges: EUR 108 per tonne;\n(iii)\nlighters: EUR 39 per tonne.\n(c)\nPusher craft: EUR 180/kW with a linear increase to EUR 240/kW where the motive power is equal to or greater than 1 000 kW.\n2.   For vessels with a deadweight capacity of less than 450 tonnes, the maximum rates for the special contributions set out in paragraph 1 shall be reduced by 30 %.\nFor vessels with a deadweight capacity of between 450 and 650 tonnes, the maximum rates for the special contributions shall be reduced by 0,15 % for every tonne by which the deadweight capacity of the vessel in question is less than 650 tonnes.\nFor vessels with a deadweight capacity of between 650 and 1 650 tonnes, the maximum rates for the special contributions shall show a linear increase from 100 % to 115 %. For vessels with a deadweight capacity of more than 1 650 tonnes, the maximum rates for the special contributions shall remain at 115 %.\nArticle 3\nEquivalent tonnage\n1.   Where a vessel owner brings into service one of the vessels referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 and presents for scrapping a vessel or vessels of another type, the equivalent tonnage to be taken into consideration shall be determined, within each of the two categories of vessels indicated below, in accordance with the following adjustment coefficients:\n(a)\nDry cargo vessels:\n(i)\nself-propelled barges over 650 tonnes: 1,00;\n(ii)\npush barges over 650 tonnes: 0,50;\n(iii)\nlighters over 650 tonnes: 0,36.\n(b)\nTanker vessels:\n(i)\nself-propelled barges over 650 tonnes: 1,00;\n(ii)\npush barges over 650 tonnes: 0,50;\n(iii)\nlighters over 650 tonnes: 0,18.\n2.   For vessels with a deadweight capacity of less than 450 tonnes, the coefficients set out in paragraph 1 shall be reduced by 30 %. For vessels with a deadweight capacity of between 650 and 450 tonnes, these coefficients shall be reduced by 0,15 % for every tonne by which the deadweight capacity of the vessel in question is less than 650 tonnes. For vessels with a deadweight capacity of between 650 and 1 650 tonnes, the coefficients shall show a linear increase from 100 to 115 %.\nArticle 4\n‘Old for new’ ratios\nThe bringing into service of vessels shall be subject to the condition laid down in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999:\n1.\nin the case of dry cargo carriers, the ratio (between old tonnage and new tonnage) shall be 0:1;\n2.\nin the case of tanker vessels, the ratio shall be 0:1;\n3.\nin the case of pusher craft, the ratio shall be 0:1.\nArticle 5\nMutual financial support\n1.   With a view to entering in the accounts the resources available in the reserve fund or to operating the mutual financial support arrangements between the accounts of the various funds as required pursuant to Article 3(6) of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999, each fund shall communicate the following information to the Commission at the beginning of each year:\n(a)\nthe fund's receipts in the previous year, in so far as these receipts are intended for the payment of scrapping premiums or measures provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 (Rdn);\n(b)\nthe financial commitments incurred by the fund during the previous year in respect of scrapping premiums or measures provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 (Pn);\n(c)\nthe fund's surplus as at 1 January of the previous year deriving from receipts intended for the payment of scrapping premiums or measures provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 (Sn).\n2.   The Commission, with the assistance of the fund authorities, shall determine, on the basis of the information referred to in paragraph 1:\n(a)\nthe total financial commitments incurred by the funds during the previous year in respect of scrapping premiums or measures provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 (Pt);\n(b)\nthe total receipts of all the funds during the previous year (Rdt);\n(c)\nthe total surplus of all the funds on 1 January of the previous year (St);\n(d)\nthe adjusted annual financial commitment of each fund (Pnn), calculated as follows:\nPnn = (Pt/(Rdt + St)) × (Rdn + Sn);\n(e)\nfor each fund, the difference between annual financial commitments (Pn) and annual adjusted financial commitments (Pnn);\n(f)\nthe sums which each fund whose annual commitments are less than the annual adjusted financial commitments (Pn < Pnn) transfers to a fund with annual financial commitments greater than the annual adjusted commitments (Pn > Pnn).\n3.   Each of the funds involved shall transfer the sums referred to in point (f) of paragraph 2 to the other funds by 1 March of the current year.\nArticle 6\nConsulting\nOn all matters concerning the Community fleet capacity policy and amendments to this Regulation the Commission shall request the opinion of a group made up of experts from the professional organisations representing inland waterway carriers at Community level and in the Member States concerned. This group shall be known as the ‘Group of Experts on Community Fleets Capacity and Promotion Policy’.\nArticle 7\nRepeal\nRegulation (EC) No 805/1999 is repealed.\nReferences to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex II.\nArticle 8\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 28 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJosé Manuel BARROSO\n(1)  OJ L 90, 2.4.1999, p. 1.\n(2)  OJ L 102, 17.4.1999, p. 64.

There are several exemptions, such as for vessels that operate on the Danube or that are used exclusively for storing goods or for dredging.\nEU countries that have fleet tonnage of over 100,000 tonnes, and with waterways connected with other EU countries, were required to set up an Inland Waterways Fund (with separate reserve funds for dry cargo carriers*, tankers* and pusher vessels*).\nThese funds were to be administered by national authorities and could be used in 2 situations: in the event of ‘serious market disturbance’ in the inland waterway transport market (within the meaning of Directive 96/75/EC); andif unanimously requested by the organisations representing inland waterway transport – as of early 2014, these reserve funds had never been used.\nThe regulation originally contained an old-for-new rule. This meant that any owner who wanted to bring a new vessel into the fleet had to either scrap old vessel tonnage or pay money. This rule came to an end under Regulation (EC) No 411/2003 (since repealed and replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 181/2008 — see below), and could only be reactivated, accompanied or not by structural improvement measures, in the event of a serious market disturbance of the kind referred to in Directive 96/75/EC.\nRegulation (EC) No 181/2008\nRegulation (EC) No 181/2008 lays down rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. It sets the rate of the special contributions referred to in Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 (Article 7), the ratios for the old-for-new rule, and the practical arrangements for implementing the Community fleet capacity policy.\nAmending Regulation (EU) No 546/2014\nUnder amending Regulation (EU) No 546/2014, the scope of the measures available under Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 was extended. The measures now include:\nhelp (such as information) for workers on inland waterway carriers leaving the industry to obtain an early retirement pension or transfer to another job;\nvocational training or retraining schemes for crew members leaving the industry;\nimprovement of skills in inland navigation and knowledge of logistics to safeguard the development and future of the profession;\nencouraging owner-operators to join trade associations and strengthen the organisations representing inland waterway transport at EU level;\nencouraging upgrading of vessels to improve working conditions and safety;\nencouraging innovation in respect of vessels and their improved environmental performance;\nencouraging the use of the reserve funds together with financial instruments such as Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\nRegulation (EC) No 718/1999 has applied since 29 April 1999.\nRegulation (EC) No 181/2008 has applied since 20 March 2008.\nAmending Regulation (EU) No 546/2014 has applied since 18 June 2014.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nInland waterways (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nDry cargo carriers: vessels that carry dry cargo (e.g. grains).\nTankers: vessels that carry wet cargo (e.g. oil).\nPusher vessels: vessels that serve to push other vessels such as barges but not to carry cargo.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 of 29 March 1999 on a Community fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport (OJ L 90, 2.4.1999, pp. 1-5)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 have been incorporated into the original text.
