{"celex_id": "32019R0856", "reference": "28.5.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 140/6\nCOMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/856\nof 26 February 2019\nsupplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the operation of the Innovation Fund\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular to the fourth subparagraph of Article 10a(8) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDetailed rules on the operation of the Innovation Fund should be established taking into account lessons learnt from the NER300 programme established under Directive 2003/87/EC and implemented on the basis of Commission Decision 2010/670/EU (2); notably the conclusions of the Court of Auditors report (3) should be taken into account.\n(2)\nIn order to cover the lower profitability and the higher technological risks of the eligible projects compared to conventional technologies, a significant part of the Innovation Fund financing should be provided in the form of a grant. Detailed rules on the disbursement of grants should therefore be established.\n(3)\nAs the risks and profitability of eligible projects may differ across sectors and activities of those projects and may also evolve over time, it is appropriate to allow for a part of the Innovation Fund support to be provided through contributions to blending operations under the Union investment support instrument, as well as in other forms provided for in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) (the ‘Financial Regulation’).\n(4)\nIt is appropriate to consider the difference between the total costs of an eligible project and the total costs of an equivalent project using conventional technology as relevant costs for the purposes of financing under the Innovation Fund. However, in order to avoid excessive administrative burden for small-scale projects and address their particular difficulties in obtaining financing, the relevant costs of a small-scale project should be the total capital expenditure cost of such a project.\n(5)\nWith a view to making adequate financial resources timely available to the eligible projects, the disbursement of grants should be based on the achievement of milestones. For all projects, the milestones should include financial close and entry into operation. As some projects might need the support to be disbursed at a different point in time, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to determine additional milestones in the contractual documentation.\n(6)\nIn order to increase the probability of success of the projects, the possibility to disburse a part of the grant prior to the entry into operation of a project should be established. The disbursement of grants should in principle start at the financial close and continue during the development and operation of the project.\n(7)\nThe major part of the Innovation Fund support should depend on verified avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions. Substantial underperformance on planned greenhouse gas emission avoidance should therefore lead to the reduction and recovery of the amount of the support dependant on such avoidance. The reduction and recovery mechanism, however, should be flexible enough to take into account the innovative nature of projects supported by the Innovation Fund.\n(8)\nGrants under the Innovation Fund should be awarded following a competitive selection process, via calls for proposals. In order to reduce the administrative burden for project proponents, a two-phase application procedure should be established, comprising an expression of interest and the full application.\n(9)\nProjects applying for the Innovation Fund support should be assessed on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria. The combination of such criteria should ensure the completeness of the project assessment in terms of its technological and business potential. To ensure fair and merit-based selection, projects should be selected based on the same selection criteria, but be evaluated and ranked first vis-à-vis other projects in the same sector and subsequently vis-à-vis projects across sectors.\n(10)\nProjects whose planning, business model and financial and legal structure appear insufficiently mature, in particular in light of a possible lack of support by the Member States concerned or of the necessary national permits, should not be selected for Innovation Fund support. However, such projects may be promising. Therefore, the possibility to provide development assistance to such projects should be laid down. Project development assistance should in particular benefit small-scale projects and projects in lower-income Member States to help achieving a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support.\n(11)\nIt is important to achieve a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support. To prevent a situation where some Member States are not sufficiently covered, the possibility should be laid down to establish additional selection criteria aimed at achieving geographical balance in a second or subsequent calls for proposals.\n(12)\nThe Commission should ensure the implementation of the Innovation Fund. The Commission should however be enabled to delegate some of the implementation actions, such as the organisation of the call for proposals, pre-selection of projects or contractual management of grants, to implementing bodies.\n(13)\nThe revenues of the Innovation Fund, including the revenues from the allowances monetised on the Common Auction Platform in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 (5), should be managed in accordance with the objectives of Directive 2003/87/EC. The Commission should therefore carry out that task itself and be enabled to delegate this task to the European Investment Bank.\n(14)\nThe Commission should apply different rules depending on the mode of the implementation of the Innovation Fund. Where the Innovation Fund is implemented in direct management, the provisions of this Regulation should be fully aligned with the provisions of the Financial Regulation.\n(15)\nMember States should play an important role in the implementation of the Innovation Fund. In particular, the Commission should consult the Member States on the key implementation decisions, as well as on the development of the Innovation Fund.\n(16)\nThe Innovation Fund should be implemented in accordance with the sound financial management principles as laid down in the Financial Regulation.\n(17)\nClear reporting, accountability and financial control arrangements should be laid down in order to ensure that the Commission receives complete and timely information on the progress of projects supported by the Innovation Fund, the entities managing the Innovation Fund apply sound financial management principles, and the Member States are in a timely manner informed about the implementation of the Innovation Fund,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down detailed rules supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC as regards:\n(a)\nthe operational objectives of the Innovation Fund established by Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC;\n(b)\nthe forms of support provided under the Innovation Fund;\n(c)\nthe application procedure for the Innovation Fund support;\n(d)\nthe procedure and criteria for project selection under the Innovation Fund;\n(e)\ndisbursement of the Innovation Fund support;\n(f)\nthe governance of the Innovation Fund;\n(g)\nreporting, monitoring, evaluation, control, and publicity concerning the operation of the Innovation Fund.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘financial close’ means the moment in the project development cycle where all the project and financing agreements have been signed and all the required conditions contained in them have been met;\n(2)\n‘entry into operation’ means the moment in the project development cycle where all elements and systems required for operation of the project have been tested and activities resulting in effective avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions have commenced;\n(3)\n‘small-scale project’ means a project with a total capital expenditure not exceeding EUR 7 500 000.\nArticle 3\nOperational objectives\nThe Innovation Fund shall have the following operational objectives:\n(a)\nto support projects demonstrating highly innovative technologies, processes or products, that are sufficiently mature and have a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;\n(b)\nto offer financial support tailored to market needs and risk profiles of eligible projects, while attracting additional public and private resources;\n(c)\nto ensure that the revenues of the Innovation Fund are managed in accordance with the objectives of Directive 2003/87/EC.\nArticle 4\nForms of the Innovation Fund support\nThe Innovation Fund support to the project may take the following forms:\n(a)\ngrants;\n(b)\ncontributions to blending operations under the Union investment support instrument;\n(c)\nwhere necessary to achieve the objectives of Directive 2003/87/EC, funding in any of the other form laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 (the ‘Financial Regulation’), in particular prizes, and procurement.\nCHAPTER II\nSpecific provisions applicable to grants\nArticle 5\nRelevant costs\n1.   For the purposes of the fourth sentence of the third subparagraph of Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC, the relevant costs shall be the additional costs that are borne by the project proponent as a result of the application of the innovative technology related to the reduction or avoidance of the greenhouse gas emissions. The relevant costs shall be calculated as the difference between the best estimate of the total capital expenditure, the net present value of operating costs and benefits arising during 10 years after the entry into operation of the project compared to the result of the same calculation for a conventional production with the same capacity in terms of effective production of the respective final product.\nWhere conventional production referred to in the first subparagraph does not exist, the relevant costs shall be the best estimate of the total capital expenditure and the net present value of operating costs and benefits arising during 10 years after the entry into operation of the project.\n2.   The relevant costs of a small-scale project shall be the total capital expenditure costs of that project.\nArticle 6\nDisbursement of grants\n1.   The Innovation Fund support, in the form of a grant, shall be disbursed upon reaching the pre-determined milestones.\n2.   For all projects, the milestones referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on the project development cycle and shall be at least the following:\n(a)\nfinancial close;\n(b)\nentry into operation.\n3.   Taking into account the technology deployed and the specific circumstances of the sector or sectors in which it is being deployed, additional specific milestones may be determined in the contractual documents.\n4.   Up to 40 % of the total amount of the Innovation Fund support, including project development assistance, to a specific project shall be disbursed upon financial close or upon reaching a specific milestone preceding financial close where such a milestone has been determined in accordance with paragraph 3.\n5.   To the extent that the total amount of the Innovation Fund support to a specific project has not been disbursed pursuant to paragraph 4, that amount shall be disbursed after the financial close. It may be partially disbursed prior to the entry into operation and in annual instalments after the entry into operation.\n6.   For the purposes of paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article, the total amount of the Innovation Fund support provided to a specific project shall include the amount of the Innovation Fund support provided to that project by way of project development assistance in accordance with Article 13.\nArticle 7\nGeneral recovery rules\n1.   The Commission shall take appropriate measures to ensure that, where activities financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests of the Innovation Fund are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the amounts unduly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative and financial penalties.\n2.   Recoveries shall be implemented in accordance with the Financial Regulation.\n3.   The grounds for recovery as well as the recovery procedures shall be further specified in the contractual documentation.\nArticle 8\nSpecial recovery rules\n1.   The amount of the Innovation Fund support disbursed in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 after the financial close shall be dependent on the avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions verified on the basis of annual reports submitted by the project proponent for a period between 3 to 10 years following the entry into operation. The final annual report submitted by the project proponent shall include the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided during the entire reporting period.\n2.   Where the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided during the entire reporting period is lower than 75 % of the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions planned to be avoided, the amount paid or to be paid to the project proponent in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 shall be proportionally recovered or reduced.\n3.   Where the project fails to enter into operation by the pre-determined time or the project proponent fails to demonstrate any real avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, the amount paid after the financial close in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 shall be fully recovered.\n4.   Where the situations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 occur due to extraordinary circumstances that are beyond the control of the project proponent and the project proponent demonstrates the project's potential to achieve an avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions beyond the reported amount, or where the project proponent demonstrates that the project can achieve significant low-carbon innovation benefits, the Commission may decide not to apply the recovery mechanisms under paragraphs 2 and 3.\n5.   The ground for recovery and recovery procedures shall be further specified in the contractual documentation.\n6.   The rules laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall be without prejudice to general recovery rules under Article 7.\nArticle 9\nCalls for proposals\n1.   The project proponents shall be invited to apply for the Innovation Fund support through open calls for proposals launched by the Commission.\nBefore adopting a decision launching a call for proposals, the Commission shall consult the Member States on the draft decision.\n2.   The Commission decision launching the calls for proposals shall include at least the following:\n(a)\nthe overall amount of the Innovation Fund support available for the call;\n(b)\nthe maximum amount of the Innovation Fund support available for project development assistance;\n(c)\nthe types of solicited projects or sectors;\n(d)\na description of the application procedure and a detailed list of information and documentation to be submitted at each phase of the application procedure;\n(e)\ndetailed information on the selection procedure, including the methodology for evaluation and ranking;\n(f)\nwhere specific application and selection procedures are applied in accordance with Article 10(4) and Article 12(6) for small-scale projects, the rules on those specific procedures;\n(g)\nwhere the Commission reserves a part of the total amount of the Innovation Fund support available for the call to small-scale projects, the amount of that part;\n(h)\nwhere additional selection criteria aimed at achieving a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support are applied in accordance with Article 11(2), those criteria.\nArticle 10\nApplication procedure\n1.   The implementing body shall collect the applications and organise the application procedure in two subsequent phases:\n(a)\nthe expression of interest;\n(b)\nthe full application.\n2.   At the expression of interest phase, the project proponent shall be required to submit a description of key project characteristics in line with the requirements laid down in the relevant call for proposals, including the description of the project's effectiveness, degree of innovation, and maturity as specified in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 11(1).\n3.

Additional criteria aimed at achieving a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support may also be applied for the purposes of project selection.\nArticle 12\nSelection procedure\n1.   Based on the applications received at the expression of interest phase, the implementing body shall assess, for each project, the eligibility in accordance with Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The implementing body shall then proceed with the selection of eligible projects under paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.\n2.   Based on the applications received at the expression of interest phase, the implementing body shall draw up a list of the projects that meet the selection criteria laid down in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 11(1) and shall invite the proponents of those projects to submit a full application.\nWhere the implementing body concluded that a project meets the selection criteria laid down in points (a) and (b) of Article 11(1), but does not meet the criterion laid down in point (c) of Article 11(1), the implementing body shall assess whether that project has the potential to meet all selection criteria if further developed. Where the project has such a potential, the implementing body may award project development assistance to the project concerned or, where the Commission implements that task, propose to the Commission to award project development assistance to the project.\n3.   Based on the full application received in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, the implementing body shall proceed with the project evaluation and ranking based on all selection criteria laid down in Article 11. For the purposes of that evaluation, the implementing body shall compare the projects with the projects in the same sector as well as with projects in other sectors, and shall draw up a list of pre-selected projects.\n4.   The list of pre-selected projects referred to in paragraph 3 and, where applicable, the suggestion referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall be communicated to the Commission and shall include at least the following:\n(a)\na confirmation of the compliance with the eligibility and selection criteria;\n(b)\ndetails on project evaluation and ranking;\n(c)\ntotal project costs and relevant costs referred to in Article 5, in euro;\n(d)\nthe request for the total Innovation Fund support in euro,\n(e)\nthe projected amount of greenhouse gas emissions to be avoided;\n(f)\nthe projected amount of energy to be produced or stored;\n(g)\nthe projected amount of CO2 to be stored;\n(h)\ninformation on the legal form of the Innovation Fund support requested by the project proponent.\n5.   On the basis of what was communicated pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, the Commission shall, after consulting the Member States in accordance with Article 21(2), adopt the award decision specifying the support to the selected projects and, where appropriate, draw up a reserve list.\n6.   A specific selection procedure may be applied for small-scale projects.\nArticle 13\nProject development assistance\n1.   The Commission shall, after consulting the Member States in accordance with Article 21(2)(c), determine the maximum amount of the Innovation Fund support available for project development assistance.\n2.   The project development assistance shall be awarded by the Commission or by the implementing body in accordance with Article 12(2) in the form of a grant.\n3.   The following activities may be funded by way of project development assistance:\n(a)\nimprovement and development of a project documentation, or of components of the project design, with a view to ensuring the sufficient maturity of the project;\n(b)\nassessment of the feasibility of the project, including technical and economic studies;\n(c)\nadvice on the financial and legal structure of the project;\n(d)\ncapacity building of the project proponent.\n4.
