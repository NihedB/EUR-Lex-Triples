Three years after the entry into force of this Agreement, at the request of either Party, the Parties shall consult to consider accelerating and broadening the scope of the reduction and elimination of customs duties on imports. A decision by the Parties in the Committee on Trade in Goods on such acceleration or broadening shall supersede any duty rate or staging category determined pursuant to their Schedules for that good.\nARTICLE 2.7\nElimination of Customs Duties and Taxes on Exports\nNeither Party shall maintain or institute any customs duty or tax on, or in connection with the exportation or sale for export of, goods to the other Party, or any internal taxes on goods exported to the other Party that are in excess of those imposed on like goods destined for internal sale.\nARTICLE 2.8\nStandstill\nUpon the entry into force of this Agreement, neither Party shall increase any existing customs duty, or introduce any new customs duty, on the importation of a good originating in the other Party.

The Parties affirm their rights and obligations arising under Article VI of GATT 1994, the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the SCM Agreement, and shall apply anti-dumping and countervailing measures in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.\n2.   The Parties, recognising that anti-dumping and countervailing measures can be abused to obstruct trade, agree that:\n(a)\nsuch measures should be used in full compliance with the relevant WTO requirements, and should be based on a fair and transparent system; and\n(b)\ncareful consideration should be given to the interests of the Party against which such a measure is to be imposed.\n3.   For the purpose of this Section, the origin of the goods shall be determined in accordance with the non-preferential rules of origin of the Parties.\nARTICLE 3.2\nTransparency and Information Exchange\n1.   After receipt by a Party's competent authorities of a properly documented anti-dumping application with respect to imports from the other Party, and no later than 15 days before initiating an investigation, that Party shall provide written notification to the other Party of its receipt of the application.\n2.   After receipt by a Party's competent authorities of a properly documented countervailing duty application with respect to imports from the other Party, and no later than 15 days before initiating an investigation, that Party shall provide written notification to the other Party of its receipt of the application and shall afford the other Party the possibility to consult with its competent authorities regarding the application, with a view to clarifying the factual situation and to arriving at a mutually agreed solution.

This is without prejudice to Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 12.4 of the SCM Agreement. Any disclosure shall be made in writing, and shall allow interested parties sufficient time to make their comments.\n4.   Each interested party shall be granted the possibility to be heard in order to express their views during trade remedies investigations.\nARTICLE 3.3\nLesser Duty Rule\nShould a Party decide to impose any anti-dumping or countervailing duty, the amount of such duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping or countervailable subsidies, and it should be less than the margin if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.\nARTICLE 3.4\nConsideration of Public Interest\nNeither Party shall apply anti-dumping or countervailing measures where, on the basis of the information made available during the investigation, it can clearly be concluded that it is not in the public interest to apply such measures.

This is without prejudice to Article 3.2 of the Safeguards Agreement.\n2.   When imposing safeguard measures, the Parties shall endeavour to impose them in a way that least affects their bilateral trade.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, if a Party considers that the legal requirements are met for the imposition of definitive safeguard measures, and it intends to apply such measures, it shall notify the other Party and give that Party the possibility of holding bilateral consultations.

If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, originating goods of a Party are being imported into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to a domestic industry producing like or directly competitive goods, the importing Party may, during the transition period only, adopt measures provided for in paragraph 2 in accordance with the conditions and procedures laid down in this Section.\n2.   The importing Party may take a bilateral safeguard measure which:\n(a)\nsuspends further reductions of the rate of customs duty on the good concerned provided for under Annex 2-A; or\n(b)\nincreases the rate of customs duty on the good concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of:\n(i)\nthe MFN applied rate of customs duty on the good in effect at the time the measure is taken; or\n(ii)\nthe base rate of customs duty specified in the Schedules included in Annex 2-A pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 2.6 (Reduction or Elimination of Customs Duties on Imports).\nARTICLE 3.11\nConditions and Limitations\n1.   A Party shall notify the other Party in writing of the initiation of an investigation described in paragraph 2 and consult with the other Party as far in advance of applying a bilateral safeguard measure as practicable, with a view to:\n(a)\nreviewing the information arising from the investigation and whether the conditions laid out in this Article are met;\n(b)\nexchanging views on the measure and its appropriateness in light of the objectives of this Section to remove serious injury or threat thereof to domestic industry caused by an increase in imports as set out in paragraph 1 of Article 3.10 (Application of Bilateral Safeguard Measure); and\n(c)\nexchanging preliminary views on compensation as set out in Article 3.13 (Compensation).\n2.   A Party shall only apply a bilateral safeguard measure following an investigation by its competent authorities in accordance with Articles 3, 4.2(a) and 4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement. To that end, Articles 3, 4.2(a) and 4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.\n3.   The determination referred to in Article 3.10 (Application of Bilateral Safeguard Measure) shall not be made unless the investigation demonstrates on the basis of objective evidence the existence of a causal link between increased imports from the other party and serious injury or the threat thereof. In this respect, due consideration shall be given to other factors, including imports of the same product from other countries.\n4.   Each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities complete any such investigation within one year of the date of its initiation.\n5.   Neither Party shall apply a bilateral safeguard measure as set out in paragraph 1 of Article 3.10 (Application of Bilateral Safeguard Measure):\n(a)\nexcept to the extent, and for such time, as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment;\n(b)\nfor a period exceeding two years, except that that period may be extended by up to two years if the competent authorities of the importing Party determine, in conformity with the procedures specified in this Article, that the measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting, provided that the total period of application of a safeguard measure, including the period of initial application and any extension thereof, shall not exceed four years; or\n(c)\nbeyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the consent of the other Party.\n6.   No measure shall be applied again to the import of the same good during the transition period, unless a period of time equal to half of the period during which the safeguard measure was applied previously has elapsed. In this case, paragraph 3 of Article 3.13 (Compensation) shall not apply.\n7.   When a Party terminates a bilateral safeguard measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate that, according to its Schedule included in Annex 2-A, would have been in effect but for the measure.\nARTICLE 3.12\nProvisional Measures\n1.   In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to repair, a Party may apply a bilateral safeguard measure on a provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports of an originating good from the other Party have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and that such imports cause serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The duration of any provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the Party shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 3.11 (Conditions and Limitations). The Party shall promptly refund any tariff increases if the investigation described in paragraph 2 of Article 3.11 (Conditions and Limitations) does not result in a finding that the requirements of Article 3.10 (Application of Bilateral Safeguard Measure) are met. The duration of any provisional measure shall be counted as part of the period prescribed by subparagraph 5(b) of Article 3.11 (Conditions and Limitations).\n2.   If a Party takes a provisional measure pursuant to this Article, that Party shall notify the other Party in writing prior to taking such measure, and shall initiate consultations with the other Party immediately after such measure is taken.\nARTICLE 3.13\nCompensation\n1.   A Party applying a bilateral safeguard measure shall consult with the other Party in order to mutually agree on appropriate trade liberalising compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or in the form of concessions equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the safeguard measure. The Party applying a bilateral safeguard measure shall provide an opportunity for such consultations no later than 30 days after the application of the bilateral safeguard measure.\n2.   If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an agreement on trade liberalising compensation within 30 days after the consultations begin, the Party whose goods are subject to the safeguard measure may suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the Party applying the safeguard measure. The exporting Party shall notify the other Party in writing at least 30 days before suspending concessions under this paragraph.\n3.   The right of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first 24 months during which a bilateral safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the safeguard measure conforms to the provisions of this Agreement.\nCHAPTER FOUR\nTECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE\nARTICLE 4.1\nObjectives\nThe objective of this Chapter is to facilitate and increase trade in goods between the Parties, by providing a framework to prevent, identify and eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade within the scope of the TBT Agreement.\nARTICLE 4.2\nScope and Definitions\n1.

The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures, including:\n(a)\nthe importing Party's reliance on a supplier's declaration of conformity;\n(b)\nagreements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures with respect to specific technical regulations conducted by bodies located in the territory of the other Party;\n(c)\nthe use of accreditation procedures to qualify conformity assessment bodies;\n(d)\ngovernment designation of conformity assessment bodies, including bodies located in the territory of the other Party;\n(e)\nunilateral recognition by a Party of the results of conformity assessment procedures conducted in the territory of the other Party;\n(f)\nvoluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies in the respective territories of each Party; and\n(g)\nthe use of regional or international multilateral recognition agreements and arrangements of which the Parties are parties.\n2.   Having regard, in particular, to those considerations, the Parties shall:\n(a)\nintensify their exchange of information regarding these and other mechanisms, with a view to facilitating the acceptance of conformity assessment results;\n(b)\nexchange information on the criteria used to select appropriate conformity assessment procedures for specific products and, in line with Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement, require that conformity assessment procedures shall not be more strict or be applied more strictly than is necessary to give the importing Party adequate confidence that products conform with the applicable technical regulations or standards, taking account of the risks non-conformity would create;\n(c)\nexchange information on accreditation policies and consider how to make the best use of international standards for accreditation and the best use of international agreements involving the Parties' accreditation bodies, for example through the mechanisms of the International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation and the International Accreditation Forum; and\n(d)\nensure that, insofar as two or more conformity assessment bodies are authorised by a Party to carry out conformity assessment procedures required for placing the product on the market, economic operators may choose among them.\n3.   The Parties reaffirm their obligation under Article 5.2.5 of the TBT Agreement that fees imposed for mandatory conformity assessment of imported products shall be equitable in relation to any fees chargeable for assessing the conformity of like products of national origin or originating in any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other costs arising from differences between location of facilities of the applicant and the conformity assessment body.\n4.   Upon request by either Party, the Parties may decide to engage in consultations with a view to defining sectoral initiatives regarding the use of conformity assessment procedures or the facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results that are appropriate for the respective sectors. The Party making the request should substantiate it with relevant information on how this sectoral initiative would facilitate trade between the Parties. In these consultations, all mechanisms described in paragraph 1 may be considered. Where a Party declines such a request from the other Party, it shall, upon request, explain its reasons.\nARTICLE 4.8\nTransparency\nThe Parties reaffirm their transparency obligations under the TBT Agreement with regard to the preparation, adoption and application of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and agree:\n(a)\nwhere a part of the process of developing a technical regulation is open to public consultation, to take the other Party's views into account and, without discrimination, to provide reasonable opportunities for the other Party and its interested persons to make comments;\n(b)\nwhen making notifications in accordance with Article 2.9 of the TBT Agreement, to allow at least 60 days following the notification for the other Party to provide comments in writing on the proposal and where practicable, to give appropriate consideration to reasonable requests for extending the comment period;\n(c)\nto allow sufficient time between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into force for economic operators of the other Party to adapt, except where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise; and\n(d)\nto make available to the other Party or its economic operators relevant information (for example through a public website, if available) on technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures in force and, as appropriate and available, written guidance on compliance with its technical regulations, upon request and without undue delay.\nARTICLE 4.9\nMarket Surveillance\nThe Parties undertake to exchange information on market surveillance and enforcement activities.\nARTICLE 4.10\nMarking and Labelling\n1.   The Parties note that, according to paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the TBT Agreement, a technical regulation may include or deal exclusively with marking or labelling requirements, and they agree, where their technical regulations contain mandatory marking or labelling, to ensure that such regulations are not prepared with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade, and that such regulations are not more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, as referred to under Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement.\n2.   The Parties agree that where a Party requires the mandatory marking or labelling of products:\n(a)\nthat Party shall endeavour to restrict its requirements only to those which are relevant for consumers or users of the product or are relevant to indicate the product's conformity with the mandatory requirements;\n(b)\nthat Party may specify the information to be provided on the label, and may require compliance with certain regulatory requirements for the affixing of the label, but shall not require any prior approval or certification of labels and markings as a precondition for sale of the products on its market, unless this is deemed necessary in the light of the risk of the product to human, animal or plant health or life;\n(c)\nwhere that Party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic operators, that Party shall ensure that such numbers are issued to the relevant economic operators without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis;\n(d)\nprovided it is not misleading, contradictory or confusing in relation to the information required in the importing Party of the goods, that Party shall permit the following to be used in the marking or labelling of products:\n(i)\ninformation in other languages in addition to the information in the language required by the importing Party of the goods;\n(ii)\ninternationally-accepted nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or graphics; and\n(iii)\nadditional information to that required in the importing Party of the goods;\n(e)\nthat Party shall accept that labelling, including re-labelling and corrections to labelling, may take place, where relevant, in authorised premises (for example, in customs warehouses at the point of import) in the territory of the importing Party prior to the distribution and sale of the product, as an alternative to labelling in the place of origin, unless such labelling in the place of origin is required for reasons of public health or safety; and\n(f)\nthat Party shall endeavour, in cases where it considers that legitimate objectives under the TBT Agreement are not compromised thereby, to accept non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than physically attached to the product.\n3.   Without prejudice to the Parties' rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement, paragraph 2 shall apply to agricultural products, industrial products, and processed agricultural food products, including beverages and spirits.\nARTICLE 4.11\nContact Points\nThe functions of the contact points designated in accordance with Article 13.4 (Enquiries and Contact Points) shall include:\n(a)\nmonitoring the implementation and administration of this Chapter;\n(b)\npromptly addressing any issue that the other Party raises related to the development, adoption, application or enforcement of standards, technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures;\n(c)\nenhancing cooperation in the development and improvement of standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures;\n(d)\nexchanging information on standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures;\n(e)\nfacilitating cooperation activities, as appropriate, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 4.4 (Joint Cooperation); and\n(f)\narranging the establishment of ad hoc working groups at the request of either Party, in order to explore ways to facilitate trade between the Parties.\nARTICLE 4.12\nFinal Provisions\n1.   The Parties may discuss, in the Committee on Trade in Goods established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), any implementing arrangements arising from this Chapter. The Parties may adopt, by decision in that Committee, any implementing measure required to this effect.\n2.   The Parties have undertaken further commitments on sector-specific non-tariff measures on goods as set out in Annex 4-A and the Appendices pertaining thereto.\nCHAPTER FIVE\nSANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES\nARTICLE 5.1\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this Chapter are:\n(a)\nto protect human, animal or plant life or health in the respective territories of the Parties while facilitating trade between the Parties in the area of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (hereinafter referred to as ‘SPS measures’);\n(b)\nto collaborate on the further implementation of the SPS Agreement; and\n(c)\nto provide a means to improve communication, cooperation and resolution of issues related to the implementation of SPS measures affecting trade between the Parties.\nARTICLE 5.2\nScope\n1.   This Chapter applies to all SPS measures of a Party that may directly or indirectly affect trade between the Parties.\n2.   This Chapter shall also apply to collaboration between the Parties on animal welfare matters of mutual interest to the Parties.\n3.   Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights of the Parties under the TBT Agreement with respect to measures not within the scope of this Chapter.\nARTICLE 5.3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Chapter:\n(a)\nthe definitions contained in Annex A of the SPS Agreement shall apply; and\n(b)\nthe Parties may agree on other definitions to be used in the application of this Chapter, taking into consideration the glossaries and definitions of relevant international organisations, such as the CODEX Alimentarius Commission (hereinafter referred to as ‘Codex Alimentarius’), the World Organisation for Animal Health (hereinafter referred to as ‘OIE’) and under the International Plant Protection Convention (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPPC’).\nARTICLE 5.4\nRights and Obligations\nThe Parties affirm their rights and obligations under the SPS Agreement.\nARTICLE 5.5\nCompetent Authorities\nThe competent authorities of the Parties responsible for the implementation of this Chapter are set out in Annex 5-A. The Parties shall notify each other of any changes to those competent authorities.\nARTICLE 5.6\nGeneral Principles\nWhen implementing this Chapter, the Parties:\n(a)\nshall ensure the consistency of SPS measures with the principles established by Article 3 of the SPS Agreement;\n(b)\nshall not use SPS measures to create unjustified barriers to trade;\n(c)\nshall ensure that procedures established under this Chapter are undertaken and completed without undue delay, and that such procedures are not applied in a manner which would constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party, where identical or similar conditions exist; and\n(d)\nshall use neither the procedures referred to in subparagraph (c), nor any requests for additional information, to delay access to their respective markets without scientific and technical justification.\nARTICLE 5.7\nImport Requirements\n1.   The import requirements of a Party shall apply to the entire territory of the other Party.\n2.   The exporting Party shall ensure that products exported to the importing Party meet the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of the importing Party.\n3.   The importing Party shall ensure that its import requirements are applied to products imported from the exporting Party in a proportionate and non-discriminatory manner.\n4.   Any fees imposed for the procedures for products imported from the exporting Party shall be equitable in relation to any fees charged for like domestic products and shall not be higher than the actual cost of the service.\n5.   The importing Party shall have the right to carry out import checks on products imported from the exporting Party for the purpose of implementing SPS measures.\n6.   The import checks carried out on products imported from the exporting Party shall be based on the sanitary and phytosanitary risk associated with such imports. They shall be carried out without undue delay and with minimum effect on trade between the Parties.\n7.   The importing Party shall make available to the exporting Party, upon request by the exporting Party, information about the frequency of import checks carried out on products from the exporting Party. The importing Party may change the frequency of physical checks on consignments, where appropriate, as a consequence of (i) verifications, (ii) import checks, or (iii) a mutual agreement between the Parties, including following the consultations provided for in this Chapter.\n8.   In the event that the import checks demonstrate that products do not comply with the relevant import requirements of the importing Party, any action taken by the importing Party should be proportionate to the sanitary and phytosanitary risk associated with the importation of the non-compliant product.\nARTICLE 5.8\nVerifications\n1.   In order to build and maintain confidence in the effective implementation of this Chapter, the importing Party shall have the right to carry out verifications at any time, including:\n(a)\nthrough verification visits to the exporting Party, to verify all or part of the inspection and certification system of the exporting Party's competent authorities, in accordance with the relevant international standards, guidelines and recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius, OIE and IPPC; and\n(b)\nby requiring the exporting Party to provide information about its inspection and certification system and by obtaining the results of the controls carried out thereunder.\n2.   The importing Party shall share with the exporting Party the results and conclusions of the verifications carried out pursuant to paragraph 1. The importing Party may make those results publicly available.\n3.   If the importing Party decides to carry out a verification visit to the exporting Party, the importing Party shall notify the exporting Party of this verification visit at least 60 calendar days before the verification visit is to be carried out, except in emergency cases or where the Parties agree otherwise. Any modification to such a visit shall be agreed by the Parties.\n4.   The costs incurred in carrying out the verification of all or part of the exporting Party's competent authorities' inspection and certification systems and the costs incurred in carrying out any inspections of individual establishments shall be borne by the importing Party.\n5.   The importing Party shall provide information in writing of a verification to the exporting Party within 60 calendar days. The exporting Party shall have 45 calendar days to comment on such information. The exporting Party's comments shall be attached to and, where appropriate, included in the final outcome document.\n6.   Notwithstanding paragraph 5, where a significant risk to human, animal or plant life or health has been identified during a verification, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party as quickly as possible, and in any case within ten calendar days following the end of the verification.\nARTICLE 5.9\nTrade Facilitation\n1.   In cases where the importing Party requires an on-the-spot verification to authorise imports of a certain category or categories of products of animal origin from the exporting Party, the following shall apply:\n(a)\nThe verification shall evaluate the exporting Party's inspection and certification system in accordance with Article 5.8 (Verifications) and shall take into consideration, upon request, any relevant written information provided by the exporting Party.\n(b)\nIn case of a satisfactory outcome of the verification of the inspection and certification system, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party in writing of the positive outcome of the verification. In such case, the information provided may include the fact that the importing Party has authorised, or will authorise, imports of specific category or categories of products.\n(c)\nIf the outcome of the verification of the inspection and certification systems is not satisfactory, the importing Party shall inform, in writing, the exporting Party of the result of the verification. In such case, the information shall include one of the following:\n(i)\na statement of the conditions, including those related to the inspection and certification system of the exporting Party, that still need to be put in place by the exporting Party to allow the importing Party to authorise imports of a specific category or categories of products of animal origin;\n(ii)\na reference to the fact that specific establishments of products of animal origin may be allowed to export to the importing Party upon compliance with the relevant import requirements of Article 5.7 (Import Requirements); or\n(iii)\na statement that the importing Party has not authorised the importation of the specific category or categories of products from the exporting Party.\n2.   In cases where the importing Party has authorised the importation of a specific category or categories of products of animal origin referred to in paragraph 1(b), the exporting Party shall inform the importing Party of the list of individual establishments that meet the importing Party's requirements in accordance with, in particular, Article 5.7 (Import Requirements) and Article 5.8 (Verifications). Furthermore the following applies:\n(a)\nAt the request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall approve individual establishments as referred to in paragraph 3 of Annex 5-B which are situated in the territory of the exporting Party, without prior inspection of those individual establishments. When requesting the approval by the importing Party, the exporting Party shall provide any information required by the importing Party to guarantee the compliance with the relevant requirements, including those of Article 5.7 (Import Requirements). The approval by the importing Party shall be consistent with the conditions set out in Annex 5-B, and shall be limited to those categories of products for which imports are authorised.\n(b)\nUpon the approval of the individual establishments referred to in subparagraph 2(a), the importing Party shall take the necessary legislative or administrative measures, in accordance with its applicable legal and administrative procedures, to allow imports within 40 calendar days of the receipt of the request of the exporting Party and, if applicable, the information required by the importing Party to guarantee the compliance with the relevant requirements, including those of Article 5.7 (Import Requirements).\n(c)\nThe importing Party shall notify the exporting Party of its acceptance or rejection of any individual establishments referred to in paragraph 2(a) and, if applicable, the reasons for any rejection.\nARTICLE 5.10\nMeasures Linked to Animal and Plant Health\n1.   The Parties recognise the concepts of pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence, in accordance with the SPS Agreement, OIE and IPPC standards, guidelines and recommendations. The SPS Committee referred to in Article 5.15 (Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) may define further details for the procedure for the recognition of such areas, including procedures for the recognition of such areas in cases where there has been an outbreak, taking into account any relevant SPS Agreement, OIE and IPPC standards, guidelines or recommendations.\n2.   When determining pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence, the Parties shall consider factors such as geographical location, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance, and the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary controls in such areas.\n3.   The Parties shall establish close cooperation on the determination of pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest and disease prevalence, with the objective of attaining confidence in the procedures followed by the other Party for the determination of such areas. When accepting the determination of such areas made by the exporting Party, the importing Party shall, in principle, base its determination of the animal or plant health status of the exporting Party or parts thereof on the information provided by the exporting Party in accordance with the SPS Agreement, OIE and IPPC standards, guidelines and recommendations.\n4.   If the importing Party does not accept the determination made by the exporting Party, it shall explain the reasons and shall be ready to enter into consultations.\n5.   Where the exporting Party claims that areas within its territory are pest- or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence, it shall provide relevant evidence in order to objectively demonstrate to the importing Party that such areas are, and are likely to remain, pest- or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence, as the case may be. For this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.\n6.   The Parties recognise the principle of compartmentalisation of the OIE and pest-free production sites of the IPPC. The SPS Committee referred to in Article 5.15 (Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) will assess any OIE and IPPC recommendations that may be issued on this matter in the future and may issue recommendations accordingly.\nARTICLE 5.11\nTransparency and Exchange of Information\n1.   The Parties shall:\n(a)\npursue transparency as regards SPS measures applicable to trade and, in particular, to those of Article 5.7 (Import Requirements) applied to imports from the other Party;\n(b)\nenhance mutual understanding of each Party's SPS measures and their application;\n(c)\nexchange information on matters related to the development and application of SPS measures, including the progress on new available scientific evidence, that affect, or may affect, trade between the Parties with a view to minimising their negative trade effects;\n(d)\ncommunicate, upon the request of a Party, the import requirements that apply to the importation of specific products within 15 calendar days; and\n(e)\ncommunicate, upon the request of a Party, progress on the application for the authorisation of specific products within 15 calendar days.\n2.   The contact points responsible for the information pursuant to paragraph 1 are those that are designated by the Parties in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 13.4 (Enquiries and Contact Points). Information shall be sent by post, fax or e-mail. Information by e-mail may be signed electronically and shall only be sent between the contact points.\n3.   Where the information pursuant to subparagraph 1(c) has been made available by notification to the WTO in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures, or where the above information has been made available on the official, publicly accessible and fee-free websites of the Parties, the information exchange referred to in that subparagraph shall be deemed to have taken place.\n4.   All notifications under this Chapter shall be made to the contact points referred to under paragraph 2.\nARTICLE 5.12\nConsultations\n1.   Each Party shall notify the other Party in writing, within two calendar days, of any serious or significant risk to human, animal or plant life or health, including any food emergencies.\n2.   Where a Party has serious concerns regarding a risk to human, animal or plant life or health, affecting commodities for which trade takes place, consultations regarding the situation shall, upon request, take place as soon as possible. In such case, each Party shall endeavour to provide all necessary information in due time to avoid disruption in trade.\n3.   Consultations referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article may be held by e-mail, video or telephone conference. The requesting Party shall ensure the preparation of the minutes of the consultation.\nARTICLE 5.13\nEmergency Measures\n1.   In case of serious risk to human, animal or plant life or health, the importing Party may, without previous notification, take measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health. For consignments in transport between the Parties, the importing Party shall consider the most suitable and proportionate solution in order to avoid unnecessary disruptions to trade.\n2.   The Party taking the measures shall inform the other Party as soon as possible, and in any case no later than 24 hours after the adoption of the measure. Either Party may request any information related to the sanitary and phytosanitary situation or to any such measures that have been adopted. The other Party shall reply as soon as the requested information is available.\n3.   Upon the request of either Party, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5.12 (Consultations), the Parties shall hold consultations regarding the situation within 15 calendar days of the notification. These consultations shall be carried out in order to avoid unnecessary disruptions to trade. The Parties may consider options for the facilitation of the implementation or the replacement of the measures.\nARTICLE 5.14\nEquivalence\n1.   The Parties may recognise the equivalence of an individual measure, groups of measures or systems applicable to a sector or to a part of a sector in accordance with paragraphs 4 to 7. The recognition of equivalence shall be applied to trade between the Parties in animals and animal products, plants and plant products, or, as appropriate, to related goods.\n2.   Where equivalence has not been recognised, trade shall take place under the conditions required by the importing Party to meet its appropriate level of protection.\n3.   The recognition of equivalence requires an assessment and acceptance of:\n(a)\nexisting SPS measures in legislation, standards and procedures, including controls related to inspection and certification systems to ensure that the SPS measures of both the exporting Party and the importing Party are met;\n(b)\nthe documented structure of the competent authorities, their powers, their chain of command, their modus operandi and the resources available to them; and\n(c)\nthe performance of the competent authority in relation to the control programmes and assurances.\n4.   In their assessments, the Parties shall take account of experience already acquired.\n5.   The importing Party shall accept a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of the exporting Party as equivalent if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates that its measure achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection. For this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.\n6.   The Parties will take into account guidance of the Codex Alimentarius, OIE, IPPC and the WTO SPS Committee in recognising equivalence.\n7.   Furthermore, where equivalence has been recognised, the Parties may agree on a simplified model for the official sanitary or phytosanitary certificates that are necessary for each consignment of animals or animal products, plants or plant products, or other related goods intended for importation.\nARTICLE 5.15\nCommittee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\n1.   The Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SPS Committee’) established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees) shall include representatives of the competent authorities of the Parties.\n2.   The SPS Committee shall meet within one year of the entry into force of this Agreement. Thereafter it shall meet at least once a year or as agreed by the Parties. The SPS Committee shall establish its rules of procedure at its first meeting. It shall meet in person, by telephone conference, by video-conference, or through any other means, as agreed by the Parties.\n3.   The SPS Committee may agree to establish technical working groups consisting of experts of the Parties, which shall identify and address technical and scientific issues arising under this Chapter and shall explore opportunities for further collaboration on SPS matters of mutual interest. When additional expertise is needed, persons other than representatives of the Parties may participate in the work of a technical working group.\n4.   The SPS Committee may address any matter related to the effective functioning of this Chapter. In particular, it shall have the following responsibilities and functions:\n(a)\ndeveloping the necessary procedures or arrangements for the implementation of this Chapter, including Annexes 5-A and 5-B;\n(b)\nmonitoring the implementation of this Chapter; and\n(c)\nproviding a forum for discussion of problems arising from the application of certain SPS measures with a view to reaching mutually acceptable solutions. In this connection, the SPS Committee shall be convened as a matter of urgency, at the request of a Party, so as to carry out consultations. Such consultations are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) and Chapter Fifteen (Mediation Mechanism).\n5.   The SPS Committee shall exchange information, expertise and experiences in the field of animal welfare in order to promote the collaboration on animal welfare between the Parties.\n6.   The Parties may, by decision in the SPS Committee, adopt recommendations and decisions related to the authorisation of imports, exchange of information, transparency, recognition of regionalisation, equivalency and alternative measures, and any other matter referred to under paragraphs 4 and 5.\nARTICLE 5.16\nTechnical Consultations\n1.   Where a Party considers that a measure of the other Party is or might be contrary to the obligations under this Chapter, and considers that the measure causes or may cause an unjustified disruption to trade, it may request technical consultations in the SPS Committee with a view to reaching mutually acceptable solutions. The competent authorities set out in Annex 5-A shall facilitate these consultations.\n2.   Technical consultations in the SPS Committee shall be deemed concluded within 30 days following the date of submission of the request for technical consultations, unless the consulting Parties agree to continue with the consultations. The technical consultations may be made via telephone conference, video-conference, or any other mechanism agreed by the Parties.\nCHAPTER SIX\nCUSTOMS AND TRADE FACILITATION\nARTICLE 6.1\nObjectives\n1.

This Sub-Section shall only apply to sectors for which a Party has undertaken specific commitments and to the extent that these specific commitments apply.\n3.   This Sub-Section does not apply to measures to the extent that the measures constitute limitations as scheduled in Articles 8.5 (Market Access) and 8.10 (Market Access) or Articles 8.6 (National Treatment) and 8.11 (National Treatment).\n4.   For the purposes of this Sub-Section:\n(a)\n‘competent authorities’ means any central, regional or local government or authority, or any non-governmental body exercising powers delegated by central or regional or local governments or authorities, which takes a decision concerning the authorisation to supply a service, including through establishment, or concerning the authorisation to establish an economic activity other than services;\n(b)\n‘licensing procedures’ means administrative or procedural rules to which a natural or a juridical person must adhere, in order to demonstrate compliance with licensing requirements when seeking authorisation to supply a service or establish an economic activity other than services, including the amendment or renewal of a license;\n(c)\n‘licensing requirements’ means substantive requirements, other than qualification requirements, with which a natural or a juridical person is required to comply in order to obtain, amend or renew authorisation to supply a service or establish in an economic activity other than services;\n(d)\n‘qualification procedures’ means administrative or procedural rules to which a natural person must adhere in order to demonstrate compliance with qualification requirements for the purpose of obtaining authorisation to supply a service; and\n(e)\n‘qualification requirements’ means substantive requirements relating to the competence of a natural person to supply a service, compliance with which is required to be demonstrated for the purpose of obtaining authorisation to supply a service.\nARTICLE 8.19\nConditions for Licensing and Qualification\n1.

An authorisation or a licence shall, subject to availability, be granted as soon as it has been established, on the basis of an appropriate examination, that the conditions have been met.\n3.   Each Party shall maintain or institute judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected entrepreneur or service supplier, for a prompt review, of and where justified, appropriate remedies for administrative decisions affecting establishment, cross-border supply of services or temporary stay of natural persons for business purposes. Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, each Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.\nThis paragraph shall not be construed as requiring a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system.\nARTICLE 8.20\nLicensing and Qualification Procedures\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that licensing and qualification procedures and formalities are as simple as possible and do not unduly complicate or delay the supply of the service. Any licensing or authorisation fees (20) which the applicants may incur from their application should be reasonable and should not in themselves restrict the supply of the service.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that the competent authority uses procedures and takes decisions in the licensing or authorisation process that are impartial with respect to all applicants. The competent authority should reach its decisions in an independent manner and should not be accountable to any supplier of the services for which the licence or authorisation is required.\n3.

Where possible, authenticated copies should be accepted in place of original documents.\n7.   Where the competent authority rejects an application, it shall inform the applicant in writing without undue delay. In principle, the applicant should, where it so requests, also be informed of the reasons for rejection of the application and of the timeframe for an appeal against the decision. Where applicable, an applicant should be permitted, within reasonable time limits, to resubmit an application.\n8.   Each Party shall ensure that a licence or an authorisation, once granted, enters into effect without undue delay in accordance with the terms and conditions specified therein.\nSUB-SECTION 3\nCOMPUTER SERVICES\nARTICLE 8.21\nComputer Services\n1.   The Parties subscribe to the understanding set out in the following paragraphs in respect of computer services liberalised in accordance with Section B (Cross-border Supply of Services), Section C (Establishment) and Section D (Temporary Presence of Natural Persons for Business Purposes).\n2.   The Parties understand that CPC (21) 84, the United Nations code used for describing computer and related services, covers all computer and related services. Technological developments have led to the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of related services that can include some or all of the basic functions listed in paragraph 3. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services functions.\n3.   Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services that provide any of the following or any combination thereof:\n(a)\nconsulting, adaptation, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical assistance or management of or for computers or computer systems;\n(b)\nconsulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of or for software (22);\n(c)\ndata processing, data storage, data hosting or database services;\n(d)\nmaintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers; and\n(e)\ntraining services for staff of clients, related to software, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.\n4.   The Parties understand that, in many cases, computer and related services enable the provision of other services (23) by both electronic and other means. However, in such cases, there is an important distinction between the computer and related service (e.g., web-hosting or application hosting) and the other service (24) enabled by the computer and related service. The other service, regardless of whether it is enabled by a computer and related service, is not covered by CPC 84.\nSUB-SECTION 4\nPOSTAL SERVICES\nARTICLE 8.22\nPrevention of Anti-Competitive Practices in the Postal Sector (25)\nEach Party shall introduce or maintain appropriate measures (26) for the purpose of preventing suppliers of postal services who, alone or together, are a major supplier in the relevant market for postal services, from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices.\nARTICLE 8.23\nIndependence of Regulatory Bodies\nRegulatory bodies shall be separate from, and shall not be accountable to, any supplier of postal services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulatory bodies shall be impartial with respect to all market participants.\nSUB-SECTION 5\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES\nARTICLE 8.24\nScope\n1.   This Sub-Section applies to measures that affect trade in telecommunications services and sets out the principles of the regulatory framework for telecommunications services, liberalised pursuant to Section B to Section D.\n2.

Each Party shall ensure that such service suppliers are permitted to:\n(a)\npurchase or lease, and attach terminal or other equipment which interfaces with the public telecommunications network;\n(b)\ninterconnect private leased or owned circuits with public telecommunications networks and services in its territory, or across its borders, or with circuits leased or owned by other service suppliers; and\n(c)\nuse operating protocols of their choice, other than as necessary to ensure the availability of telecommunications networks and services to the public generally.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that all service suppliers of the other Party may use public telecommunications networks and services for the movement of information in its territory or across its borders, including for intra-corporate communications of such service suppliers and for access to information contained in databases or otherwise stored in machine-readable form in the territory of either Party. Any new or amended measures of a Party significantly affecting such use shall be notified to the other Party and shall be subject to consultations.\nARTICLE 8.27\nConfidentiality of Information\nEach Party shall ensure the confidentiality of telecommunications and related traffic data by means of any public telecommunications network or service, without restricting trade in services.\nARTICLE 8.28\nInterconnection (27)\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that any service supplier authorised to provide public telecommunications networks or services has the right and obligation to negotiate interconnection with other suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services. Interconnection should be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiations between the parties concerned.\n2.   Regulatory authorities shall ensure that suppliers that acquire information from another undertaking during the process of negotiating interconnection arrangements use that information solely for the purpose for which it was supplied, and at all times respect the confidentiality of information transmitted or stored.\nARTICLE 8.29\nInterconnection with Major Suppliers\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that any major supplier in its territory provides interconnection for the facilities and equipment of suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party at any technically feasible point in the major supplier's network. Such interconnection shall be provided:\n(a)\nunder non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications) and rates, and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for the own like services of such major supplier, or for like services of non-affiliated suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services, or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;\n(b)\nin a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications), and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, are reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and are sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided; and\n(c)\nupon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the majority of suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory make publicly available their interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer.\n3.   The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier shall be made publicly available.\n4.   When suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services are unable to resolve disputes regarding the terms, conditions and rates on which interconnection is to be provided by a major supplier, they shall have recourse to the regulatory authority, which shall aim to resolve the disputes in the shortest possible timeframe and in any case within 180 days of the referral to it, provided that the resolution of complex disputes may take longer than 180 days.\nARTICLE 8.30\nConduct of Major Suppliers\n1.   Each Party may impose obligations of non-discrimination on major suppliers in relation to interconnection or access.\n2.   Obligations of non-discrimination shall ensure, in particular, that the major supplier applies equivalent conditions in equivalent circumstances to other suppliers providing equivalent services and provides services and information to others under equivalent conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own services or for the services of its subsidiaries or partners.\nARTICLE 8.31\nCompetitive Safeguards on Major Suppliers\nEach Party shall introduce or maintain appropriate measures (28) for the purpose of preventing suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services who, alone or together, are a major supplier in its territory from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices. These anti-competitive practices shall include in particular:\n(a)\nengaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation or margin squeeze;\n(b)\nusing information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results;\n(c)\nnot making available to suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services, on a timely basis, technical information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are necessary for them to provide public telecommunications services;\n(d)\npricing services in a manner that is likely to unreasonably restrict competition, such as predatory pricing.\nARTICLE 8.32\nUnbundled Network Elements\n1.   Each Party shall impose obligations on major suppliers to meet reasonable requests for access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities at any technically feasible point, on an unbundled basis, in a timely fashion and on terms and conditions that are reasonable, transparent, and non-discriminatory, and in particular:\n(a)\nto give access to specified network elements and/or facilities, including access to network elements which are not active, and/or unbundled access to the local loop to, inter alia, allow subscriber line resale offers;\n(b)\nto grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services;\n(c)\nto provide co-location; and\n(d)\nto provide services required to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users.\n2.   When a Party is considering the obligations referred in paragraph 1, it may take account of, inter alia, the following factors:\n(a)\nthe technical and economic viability of using or installing competing facilities, taking into account the nature and type of interconnection and access involved, including the viability of other upstream access products such as access to ducts;\n(b)\nthe feasibility of providing the access proposed, in relation to the capacity available;\n(c)\nthe initial investment by the facility owner, taking into account the risks involved in making the investment; and\n(d)\nthe need to safeguard effective and sustainable competition.\nARTICLE 8.33\nCo-location\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide to suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party physical co-location of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements in a timely fashion and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and non-discriminatory.\n2.

Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of public telecommunications networks or services or telecommunications equipment. To this end, each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body does not hold any financial interest or control in such a supplier.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that the decisions of, and procedures followed by, its telecommunications regulatory bodies are fair and impartial with respect to all market participants and that they are made and implemented without undue delay. To this end, each Party shall ensure that any financial interest that it holds in a supplier of public telecommunications networks or services does not influence the decisions of, and procedures followed by, its telecommunications regulatory body.\n3.   The powers of the regulatory authorities shall be exercised transparently in accordance with the applicable domestic law.\n4.   Regulatory authorities shall have the power to ensure that suppliers of telecommunications transport networks and services within their respective territories provide them, promptly upon request, with all the information, including financial information, which is necessary to enable the regulatory authorities to carry out their tasks in accordance with this Sub-Section. Information requested shall be reasonably proportionate to the performance of the regulatory authorities' tasks and treated in accordance with the requirements of confidentiality.\n5.   The regulatory authority shall be sufficiently empowered to regulate the sector. The tasks to be undertaken by a regulatory authority shall be made public in an easily accessible and clear form, in particular where those tasks are assigned to more than one body.\nARTICLE 8.40\nUniversal Services\n1.   Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligations that it wishes to maintain.\n2.   Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided that they are administered in a transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.\n3.   Where a Party requires a supplier of telecommunications services to provide directories of subscribers, that Party shall ensure that the supplier applies the principle of non-discrimination to the treatment of information that has been provided to them by other suppliers of such telecommunications services.\nARTICLE 8.41\nAuthorisation to Provide Telecommunications Services\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that licensing procedures are as simple as possible and do not unduly complicate or delay the provisions of the service.\n2.   Where a Party requires a supplier of public telecommunications networks or services to have a licence, that Party shall make publicly available:\n(a)\nall the licensing criteria, terms, conditions and procedures it applies; and\n(b)\na reasonable period of time that would normally be required to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that, if it so requests, the applicant receives in writing the reasons for the denial of a licence.\n4.   Where a licence has been unduly denied, the applicant for a licence shall be able to seek recourse before an appeal body.\n5.   Any licensing or authorisation fees (29) which the applicants may incur from their application should be reasonable and should not in themselves restrict the supply of the service.\nARTICLE 8.42\nAllocation and Use of Scarce Resources\n1.   Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.\n2.   The Parties understand that decisions on allocating and assigning spectrum and frequency management are not measures that are per se inconsistent with Articles 8.5 (Market Access) and 8.10 (Market Access). Accordingly, each Party retains the right to exercise its spectrum and frequency management policies, which may affect the number of suppliers of public telecommunications services, provided that this is done in a manner that is consistent with this Chapter. The Parties also retain the right to allocate frequency bands in a manner that takes existing and future needs into account.\nARTICLE 8.43\nEnforcement\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body maintains appropriate procedures and has the authority to enforce domestic measures relating to the obligations under this Sub-Section. Such procedures and authority shall include the ability to impose timely, proportionate and effective sanctions, and the ability to modify, suspend, and revoke licences.\n2.   Where a major supplier refuses the application of the rights and obligations provided for in Article 8.29 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 8.30 (Conduct of Major Suppliers), Article 8.31 (Competitive Safeguards on Major Suppliers), Article 8.32 (Unbundled Network Elements), Article 8.33 (Co-location), Article 8.34 (Resale), Article 8.35 (Facility Sharing) or Article 8.36 (Provisioning of Leased Circuit Services), the requesting service supplier may seek the intervention of the regulatory body, which shall issue, in accordance with its domestic law, a binding decision, in the shortest possible period of time, and in any case within a reasonable period of time.\nARTICLE 8.44\nResolution of Telecommunications Disputes\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party have timely recourse to a telecommunications regulatory body or other relevant body to resolve disputes arising under domestic measures that address a matter set out in this Sub-Section.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party that is affected by a decision of its telecommunications regulatory body may appeal against that decision to a judicial or administrative authority independent of the parties involved.\n3.   Where the appeal body is not judicial in character, written reasons for its decision shall be given and its decision shall be subject to review by an impartial and independent judicial authority.\n4.   Decisions taken by appeal bodies shall be effectively implemented by the parties concerned in accordance with the applicable domestic law and internal procedures. An appeal shall not relieve a party concerned of its obligation to comply with the underlying regulatory decision unless an appropriate authority has stayed that regulatory decision.\nARTICLE 8.45\nTransparency\nWhen regulatory bodies intend to take measures related to the provisions of this Sub-Section, they shall give interested parties the opportunity to comment on the draft measure within a reasonable period of time, in accordance with their domestic law. Regulatory bodies shall make their consultation procedures for such draft measures publicly available. The results of the consultation procedure should be made publicly available by the regulatory body except in the case of confidential information in accordance with the domestic law on business confidentiality.\nARTICLE 8.46\nFlexibility in the Choice of Technologies\nNeither Party shall prevent suppliers of public telecommunications services from having the flexibility to choose the technologies that they use to supply their services, subject to the ability of each Party to take measures to ensure that end-users of different networks are able to communicate with each other.\nARTICLE 8.47\nRelationship to other Sub-Sections, Sections and Chapters\nIn the event of any inconsistency between this Sub-Section and another Sub-Section or Section in this Chapter or another Chapter, this Sub-Section shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.\nARTICLE 8.48\nCooperation\n1.   The Parties, recognising the rapid development of the telecommunications and information technology industry, both in the domestic and international contexts, shall cooperate to promote the development of such services with a view to obtaining the maximum benefit for the Parties from the use of telecommunications and information technology.\n2.   The areas of cooperation may include the following:\n(a)\nexchanging views on policy issues such as the regulatory framework for high speed broadband networks and the reduction of international mobile roaming charges; and\n(b)\npromoting the use by consumers, the public sector and the private sector of telecommunications and information technology services, including newly emerging services.\n3.

As regards international maritime transport, the Parties agree to ensure the effective application of the principles of unrestricted access to cargoes on a commercial basis, the freedom to supply international maritime transport services, as well as national treatment in the framework of the supply of such services.\nIn view of the existing levels of liberalisation between the Parties in international maritime transport:\n(a)\nthe Parties shall effectively apply the principle of unrestricted access to the international maritime transport markets and trades on a commercial and non-discriminatory basis; and\n(b)\neach Party shall grant to ships flying the flag of the other Party or operated by service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment that the granting Party accords to its own ships or those of any third country, whichever is better, with regard to, inter alia, access to ports, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as well as with regard to related fees and charges, customs facilities and access to berths and facilities for loading and unloading.\n4.   In applying these principles, the Parties shall:\n(a)\nnot introduce cargo-sharing arrangements in future agreements with third countries concerning maritime transport services, including dry and liquid bulk and liner trade, and shall terminate, within a reasonable period of time, any such cargo-sharing arrangements that exist in previous agreements; and\n(b)\nupon the entry into force of this Agreement, abolish and abstain from introducing any unilateral measures (30) or administrative, technical and other obstacles which could constitute a disguised restriction or could have discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport.\n5.   Each Party shall permit international maritime transport service suppliers of the other Party to have an establishment in its territory under conditions of establishment and operation in accordance with the conditions inscribed in its Schedule of Specific Commitments.\n6.

Procuring entities are encouraged to publish by electronic means through the single point of access used for the publication of notices of intended procurement as early as possible in each fiscal year a notice regarding their future procurement plans (hereinafter referred to as a ‘notice of planned procurement’). That notice of planned procurement should include the subject-matter of the procurement and the planned date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement.\n5.

Each Party, including its procuring entities, may maintain a supplier registration system under which interested suppliers are required to register and provide certain information.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that:\n(a)\nits procuring entities make efforts to minimise differences in their qualification procedures; and\n(b)\nwhere its procuring entities maintain registration systems, those procuring entities make efforts to minimise differences in their registration systems.\n3.   Neither Party, including its procuring entities, shall adopt or apply any registration system or qualification procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to the participation of suppliers of the other Party in its procurement.\n4.   Where a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, that procuring entity shall:\n(a)\nin the notice of intended procurement include at least the information in subparagraphs 2(a), (b), (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of Article 9.6 (Notices) and invite suppliers to submit a request for participation; and\n(b)\nby the commencement of the time period for tendering, provide at least the information in subparagraphs 2(c), (d), (e), (h), and (i) of Article 9.6 (Notices) to the qualified suppliers that it notifies in accordance with subparagraph 3(b) of Article 9.10 (Time Periods).\n5.   Procuring entities shall allow all qualified suppliers to participate in a particular procurement, unless the procuring entity sets a limit in the notice of intended on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender and states the criteria for selecting the limited number of suppliers. In any case, the number of suppliers permitted to submit a tender shall be sufficient to ensure competition without affecting the operational efficiency of the procurement system.\n6.   Where the tender documentation is not made publicly available from the date of publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 4, the procuring entity shall ensure that those documents are made available at the same time to all the qualified suppliers that have been selected in accordance with paragraph 5.\n7.   Procuring entities may maintain a multi-use list of suppliers, provided that a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list is:\n(a)\npublished annually; and\n(b)\nwhere published by electronic means, made available continuously, in the appropriate medium listed in Annex 9-H.\n8.   The notice provided for in paragraph 7 shall include:\n(a)\na description of the goods or services, or categories thereof, for which the list may be used;\n(b)\nthe conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers for inclusion on the list and the methods that the procuring entity will use to verify that a supplier satisfies the conditions;\n(c)\nthe name and address of the procuring entity and other information necessary to contact the procuring entity and obtain all relevant documents relating to the list;\n(d)\nthe period of validity of the list and the means for its renewal or termination, or where the period of validity is not provided, an indication of the method by which notice will be given of the termination of use of the list; and\n(e)\nan indication that the list may be used for procurement covered by this Agreement.\n9.   Notwithstanding paragraph 7, where a multi-use list will be valid for three years or less, procuring entities may publish the notice referred to in paragraph 7 only once, at the beginning of the period of validity of the list, provided that the notice:\n(a)\nstates the period of validity and that further notices will not be published; and\n(b)\nis published by electronic means and is made available continuously during the period of its validity.\n10.   Procuring entities shall allow suppliers to apply at any time for inclusion on a multi-use list and shall include on the list all qualified suppliers within a reasonably short time.\n11.   Where a supplier that is not included on a multi-use list submits a request for participation in a procurement based on a multi-use list and all required documents relating thereto within the time period provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 9.10 (Time Periods), the procuring entity shall examine the request. The procuring entity shall not exclude the supplier from consideration in respect of the procurement on the grounds that the procuring entity has insufficient time to examine the request unless, in exceptional cases, due to the complexity of the procurement, the procuring entity is not able to complete the examination of the request within the time period allowed for the submission of tenders.\n12.   Procuring entities covered under Annex 9-C may use a notice inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion on a multi-use list as a notice of intended procurement, provided that:\n(a)\nthe notice is published in accordance with paragraph 7 and includes the information in paragraph 8, as much of the information in paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices) as is available, and a statement that it constitutes a notice of intended procurement or that only the suppliers on the multi-use list will receive further notices of procurement covered by the multi-use list; and\n(b)\nthe procuring entity promptly provides to suppliers that have expressed an interest to the procuring entity in a given procurement, sufficient information to permit them to assess their interest in the procurement, including all remaining information required in paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices), to the extent such information is available.\n13.   Procuring entities covered under Annex 9-C may allow a supplier that has applied for inclusion on a multi-use list in accordance with paragraph 10 to tender in a given procurement, where there is sufficient time for the procuring entity to examine whether the supplier satisfies the conditions for participation.\n14.   Procuring entities shall promptly inform any supplier that submits a request for participation or application for inclusion on a multi-use list of the procuring entity's decision with respect to the request.\n15.   Where a procuring entity rejects a supplier's request for participation or application for inclusion on a multi-use list, ceases to recognise a supplier as qualified, or removes a supplier from a multi-use list, that procuring entity shall promptly inform the supplier and, at the request of the supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written explanation of the reasons for its decision.\nARTICLE 9.9\nTechnical Specifications and Tender Documentation\n1.   Procuring entities shall not prepare, adopt, or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade.\n2.   In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or services being procured, procuring entities shall, where appropriate:\n(a)\nset out the technical specification in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and\n(b)\nbase the technical specification on international standards, where such exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognised national standards, or building codes.\n3.   Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the technical specifications, procuring entities should indicate, where appropriate, that they will consider tenders of equivalent goods or services that demonstrably fulfil the requirements of the procurement by including words such as ‘or equivalent’ in the tender documentation.\n4.   Procuring entities shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer, or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements, and provided that, in such cases, the procuring entity include words such as ‘or equivalent’ in the tender documentation.\n5.   Procuring entities shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement.\n6.   For greater certainty, each Party, including its procuring entities, may, in accordance with this Article, prepare, adopt, or apply technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or protect the environment.\n7.   Where procuring entities lay down environmental characteristics in terms of performance or functional requirement, as referred to in paragraph 2(a), they may consider using the detailed specification or, if necessary, parts thereof, as defined by eco-labels existing within the Union and green labels existing in Singapore, provided that:\n(a)\nthose specifications are appropriate to define the characteristics of the supplies or services that are the object of the contract;\n(b)\nthe requirements of the label are drawn up on the basis of scientific information; and\n(c)\nthose specifications are accessible to all interested parties.\n8.   Procuring entities shall provide to suppliers tender documentation that includes all information necessary to permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders. Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall include a complete description of:\n(a)\nthe procurement, including the nature and the quantity of the goods or services to be procured or, where the quantity is not known, the estimated quantity and any requirements to be fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity assessment certification, plans, drawings, or instructional materials;\n(b)\nany conditions for participation of suppliers, including a list of information and documents that suppliers are required to submit in connection with the conditions for participation;\n(c)\nall evaluation criteria that the procuring entity will apply in the awarding of the contract and, except where price is the sole criterion, the relative importance of such criteria;\n(d)\nwhere the procuring entity will conduct the procurement by electronic means, any authentication and encryption requirements or other requirements related to the submission of information by electronic means;\n(e)\nwhere the procuring entity will hold an electronic auction, the rules, including identification of the elements of the tender related to the evaluation criteria, on which the auction will be conducted;\n(f)\nwhere there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time, and place for the opening and, where appropriate, the persons authorised to be present;\n(g)\nany other terms or conditions, including terms of payment and any limitation on the means by which tenders may be submitted, such as whether on paper or by electronic means; and\n(h)\nany dates for the delivery of goods or the supply of services.\n9.   In establishing any delivery date for the goods or services being procured, procuring entities shall take into account such factors as the complexity of the procurement, the extent of subcontracting anticipated and the realistic time required for production, de-stocking and transport of goods from the point of supply or for supply of services.\n10.   Procuring entities may lay down environmental conditions relating to the performance of a procurement, provided that these are compatible with the rules established by this Chapter and are indicated in the notice of intended procurement or in another notice used as a notice of intended procurement (33) or tender documentation.\n11.   The evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or in another notice used as a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation may include, among others, price and other cost factors, quality, technical merit, environmental characteristics, and terms of delivery.\n12.   Procuring entities shall promptly:\n(a)\nmake available tender documentation to ensure that interested suppliers have sufficient time to submit responsive tenders;\n(b)\nprovide, on request, the tender documentation to any interested supplier; and\n(c)\nreply to any reasonable request for relevant information by any interested or participating supplier, provided that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over other suppliers.\n13.   Where, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the criteria or requirements set out in a notice of intended procurement or in another notice used as a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation provided to participating suppliers, or amends or reissues a notice or tender documentation, it shall transmit in writing all such modifications or amended or re-issued notices or tender documentation:\n(a)\nto all suppliers that are participating at the time of the modification, amendment or re-issuance, where such suppliers are known to the procuring entity, and in all other cases, in the same manner as the original information was made available; and\n(b)\nin adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and re-submit amended tenders, as appropriate.\nARTICLE 9.10\nTime Periods\n1.   Procuring entities shall, consistent with their own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time for suppliers to prepare and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders, taking into account such factors as:\n(a)\nthe nature and complexity of the procurement;\n(b)\nthe extent of subcontracting anticipated; and\n(c)\nthe time necessary for transmitting tenders by non-electronic means from foreign as well as domestic points, where electronic means are not used.\nSuch time-periods, including any extension of the time periods, shall be the same for all interested or participating suppliers.\n2.   Procuring entities that use selective tendering shall establish that, in principle, the final date for the submission of requests for participation shall not be less than 25 days from the date of publication of the notice of intended procurement. Where a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders this time period impracticable, the time period may be reduced to not less than ten days.\n3.   Except as provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 8, procuring entities shall establish that the final date for the submission of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date on which:\n(a)\nin the case of open tendering, the notice of intended procurement is published; or\n(b)\nin the case of selective tendering, the procuring entity notifies suppliers that they will be invited to submit tenders, whether or not it uses a multi-use list.\n4.   Procuring entities may reduce the time-period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to not less than ten days where:\n(a)\nthe procuring entity published a notice of planned procurement under paragraph 4 of Article 9.6 (Notices) at least 40 days and not more than twelve months in advance of the publication of the notice of intended procurement, and the notice of planned procurement contains:\n(i)\na description of the procurement;\n(ii)\nthe approximate final dates for the submission of tenders or requests for participation;\n(iii)\na statement that interested suppliers should express their interest in the procurement to the procuring entity;\n(iv)\nthe address from which documents relating to the procurement may be obtained; and\n(v)\nas much of the information that is required under paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices) for the notice of intended procurement, as is available;\n(b)\nthe procuring entity, for procurements of a recurring nature, indicated in an initial notice of intended procurement that subsequent notices will provide time periods for tendering based on this paragraph; or\n(c)\na state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity has rendered the time period for tendering established in accordance with paragraph 3 impracticable.\n5.   Procuring entities may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 by five days for each one of the following circumstances:\n(a)\nthe notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means;\n(b)\nall the tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement; and\n(c)\nthe tenders can be received by electronic means by the procuring entity.\n6.   The use of paragraph 5, in conjunction with paragraph 4, shall in no case result in the reduction of the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to less than ten days from the date on which the notice of intended procurement is published.\n7.   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article, where a procuring entity purchases commercial goods or services, or any combination thereof, it may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to not less than thirteen days, provided that it publishes by electronic means, at the same time, both the notice of intended procurement and the tender documentation. In addition, where the procuring entity also accepts tenders for commercial goods and services by electronic means, it may reduce the time period set out in paragraph 3 to not less than ten days.\n8.   Where a procuring entity covered under Annexes 9-B or 9-C has selected all or a limited number of qualified suppliers, the time period for tendering may be fixed by mutual agreement between the procuring entity and the selected suppliers. In the absence of agreement, the period shall not be less than ten days.\nARTICLE 9.11\nNegotiations\n1.   Each Party may provide for its procuring entities to conduct negotiations:\n(a)\nwhere the procuring entity has indicated its intent to conduct negotiations in the notice of intended procurement required under paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices); or\n(b)\nwhere it appears from the evaluation that no one tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or in another notice used as a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation.\n2.   Procuring entities shall:\n(a)\nensure that any elimination of suppliers participating in negotiations is carried out in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or in another notice used as a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation; and\n(b)\nwhere negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the remaining participating suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.\nARTICLE 9.12\nLimited Tendering\n1.   Provided that they do not use this provision for the purpose of avoiding competition among suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of the other Party or protects domestic suppliers, procuring entities may use limited tendering and may choose not to apply Article 9.6 (Notices), Article 9.7 (Conditions for Participation), Article 9.8 (Qualification of Suppliers), paragraphs 8 to 13 of Article 9.9 (Technical Specifications and Tender Documentation), Article 9.10 (Time Periods), Article 9.11 (Negotiations), Article 9.13 (Electronic Auctions), and Article 9.14 (Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts) only under any of the following circumstances:\n(a)\nwhere:\n(i)\nno tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation;\n(ii)\nno tenders that conform to the essential requirements of the tender documentation were submitted;\n(iii)\nno suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or\n(iv)\nthe tenders submitted have been collusive;\nprovided that the procuring entity does not substantially modify the requirements set out in the tender documentation;\n(b)\nwhere the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute goods or services exist for any of the following reasons:\n(i)\nthe requirement is for a work of art;\n(ii)\nthe protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or\n(iii)\ndue to an absence of competition for technical reasons;\n(c)\nfor additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods and services that were not included in the initial procurement where a change of supplier for such additional goods and services:\n(i)\ncannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services, or installations procured under the initial procurement; and\n(ii)\nwould cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the procuring entity;\n(d)\ninsofar as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time using open tendering or selective tendering;\n(e)\nfor goods purchased on a commodity market;\n(f)\nwhere a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development. Original development of a first good or service may include limited production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that the good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity at acceptable quality standards, but does not include quantity production, supply for the purpose of establishing commercial viability, or the recovery of research and development costs;\n(g)\nfor purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the very short term in the case of unusual disposals, such as those arising from liquidation, receivership, or bankruptcy, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers; and\n(h)\nwhere a contract is awarded to a winner of a design contest, provided that:\n(i)\nthe contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with the principles of this Chapter, in particular relating to the publication of a notice of intended procurement; and\n(ii)\nthe participants are judged by an independent jury with a view to a design contract being awarded to a winner.\n2.   Procuring entities shall prepare a report in writing on each contract awarded under paragraph 1. The report shall include the name of the procuring entity, the value and kind of goods or services procured, and a statement indicating the circumstances and conditions described in paragraph 1 that justified the use of limited tendering.\nARTICLE 9.13\nElectronic Auctions\nWhere a procuring entity intends to conduct a covered procurement using an electronic auction, the procuring entity shall provide each participant, before commencing the electronic auction, with:\n(a)\nthe automatic evaluation method, including the mathematical formula, that is based on the evaluation criteria set out in the tender documentation and that will be used in the automatic ranking or re-ranking during the auction;\n(b)\nthe results of any initial evaluation of the elements of its tender where the contract is to be awarded on the basis of the most advantageous tender; and\n(c)\nany other relevant information relating to the conduct of the auction.\nARTICLE 9.14\nTreatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts\n1.   Procuring entities shall receive, open, and treat all tenders in accordance with procedures that guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement process, and the confidentiality of tenders.\n2.   Procuring entities shall not penalise any supplier whose tender is received after the time specified for receiving tenders if the delay was due solely to mishandling on the part of the procuring entity.\n3.   Where a procuring entity provides a supplier with an opportunity to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall provide the same opportunity to all participating suppliers.\n4.   To be considered for an award, a tender shall have been submitted in writing and shall, at the time of opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in the notices and tender documentation, and shall be from a supplier that satisfies the conditions for participation.\n5.   Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, the procuring entity shall award the contract to the supplier that the procuring entity has determined to be capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notices and tender documentation, has submitted:\n(a)\nthe most advantageous tender; or\n(b)\nwhere price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.\n6.   Where a procuring entity receives a tender with a price that is abnormally lower than the prices in other tenders submitted, it may verify with the supplier that it satisfies the conditions for participation and is capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract, and whether the price takes into account the grant of subsidies.\n7.   Where a procuring entity establishes that a tender is abnormally low because the supplier has obtained subsidies, it may reject the tender on that ground alone only after having consulted with the supplier and the latter is unable to prove, within a sufficient period fixed by the procuring entity, that the subsidy in question was granted in compliance with the disciplines relating to subsidies laid down in this Agreement.\n8.   A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a procurement, or modify awarded contracts, in a manner that circumvents the obligations under this Chapter.\nARTICLE 9.15\nTransparency of Procurement Information\n1.   Procuring entities shall promptly inform participating suppliers of the procuring entity's contract award decisions and, upon the request of a supplier, shall do so in writing. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 9.16 (Disclosure of Information), procuring entities shall, upon request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the procuring entity did not select its tender and the relative advantages of the successful supplier's tender.\n2.   Not later than 72 days after the award of each contract covered by this Chapter, the procuring entity shall publish a notice in the appropriate paper or electronic medium listed in Annex 9-H. Where the procuring entity publishes the notice only in an electronic medium, the information shall remain readily accessible for a reasonable period of time. The notice shall include at least the following information:\n(a)\na description of the goods or services procured;\n(b)\nthe name and address of the procuring entity;\n(c)\nthe name and address of the successful supplier;\n(d)\nthe value of the successful tender or the highest and lowest offers taken into account in the award of the contract;\n(e)\nthe date of award; and\n(f)\nthe type of procurement method used, and in cases where limited tendering was used pursuant to Article 9.12 (Limited Tendering), a description of the circumstances justifying the use of limited tendering.\n3.   Each procuring entity shall, for a period of at least three years from the date it awards a contract, maintain:\n(a)\nthe documentation and reports of tendering procedures and contract awards relating to covered procurement, including the reports required under Article 9.12 (Limited Tendering); and\n(b)\ndata that ensure the appropriate traceability of the conduct of covered procurement by electronic means.\n4.   Each Party agrees to communicate to the other Party the available and comparable statistical data relevant to the procurement covered by this Chapter.\nARTICLE 9.16\nDisclosure of Information\n1.   Upon the request of a Party, the other Party shall promptly provide any information necessary to determine whether a procurement was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with this Chapter, including information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender. In cases where release of the information would prejudice competition in future tenders, the Party that receives that information shall not disclose such information to any supplier, except after consultation with, and the agreement of, the Party that provided the information.\n2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not provide to any particular supplier information that might prejudice fair competition between suppliers.\n3.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as requiring a Party, including its procuring entities, authorities, and review bodies, to disclose confidential information where disclosure:\n(a)\nwould impede law enforcement;\n(b)\nmight prejudice fair competition between suppliers;\n(c)\nwould prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons, including the protection of intellectual property; or\n(d)\nwould otherwise be contrary to the public interest.\nARTICLE 9.17\nDomestic Review Procedures\n1.   Each Party shall provide a timely, effective, transparent, and non-discriminatory administrative or judicial review procedure through which a supplier may challenge:\n(a)\na breach of this Chapter; or\n(b)\nwhere the supplier does not have the right to challenge a breach of this Chapter directly under the domestic law of that Party, a failure to comply with that Party's measures implementing this Chapter,\narising in the context of a covered procurement in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest. In any case, each Party shall ensure that the review body, upon a challenge by a supplier, can examine decisions taken by their respective procuring entities on whether a particular procurement falls within the procurement that is covered by this Chapter.\nThe procedural rules for all challenges shall be in writing and made generally available through electronic means or a paper medium.\n2.   In the event of a complaint by a supplier, that there has been a breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1 arising in the context of covered procurement in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest, the Party of the procuring entity conducting the procurement shall encourage the procuring entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the complaint through consultations. The procuring entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any such complaint in a manner that is not prejudicial to the supplier's participation in on-going or future procurement or to its right to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial review procedure.\n3.   Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and submit a challenge, which in no case shall be less than ten days from the time when the basis of the challenge became known to the supplier or reasonably should have become known to the supplier.\n4.   Each Party shall establish or designate at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of its procuring entities for the purpose of receiving and reviewing challenges by suppliers arising in the context of covered procurements.\n5.   Where a body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 4 initially reviews a challenge, the relevant Party shall ensure that the supplier may appeal the initial decision to an impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of the procuring entity whose procurement is the subject of the challenge.\n6.   Each Party shall ensure that a review body that is not a court shall have its decision subject to judicial review or have procedures that provide that:\n(a)\nthe procuring entity shall respond in writing to the challenge and disclose all relevant documents to the review body;\n(b)\nthe participants to the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as ‘participants’) shall have the right to be heard prior to the decision of the review body on the challenge;\n(c)\nthe participants shall have the right to be represented and accompanied;\n(d)\nthe participants shall have access to all proceedings;\n(e)\nthe participants shall have the right to request that the proceedings take place in public and that witnesses may be presented; and\n(f)\nthe review body shall make its decisions or recommendations, in a timely fashion, in writing, and shall include an explanation of the basis for each decision or recommendation.\n7.   Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for rapid interim measures to preserve the supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement. Such interim measures may result in suspension of the procurement process. The procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account when deciding whether such measures should be applied. Just cause for not acting shall be provided in writing.\n8.   Each Party shall provide that where a review body has determined that there has been a breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1, the review body may impose corrective action or grant compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to either the costs for the preparation of the tender or the costs relating to the challenge. Where a contract has already been awarded, the Parties may provide that corrective action is not available.\nARTICLE 9.18\nModification and Rectification of Coverage\n1.   Each Party shall notify the other Party of any proposed rectification of Annexes 9-A to 9-I, any transfer of an entity from one of those Annexes to another, any withdrawal of an entity from those Annexes, or any other modification to those Annexes (such acts collectively referred hereinafter to as a ‘modification’).\n2.   For any proposed withdrawal by a Party of a procuring entity from Annexes 9-A to 9-C on the grounds that government control or influence over the procuring entity's covered procurement has been effectively eliminated, the Party proposing the modification (hereinafter referred to as ‘modifying Party’) shall include in the notification evidence that such government control or influence has been effectively eliminated. Government control or influence over the covered procurement of entities covered under Annex 9-C is deemed to be effectively eliminated if:\n(a)\nin the case of the Union, the procuring entity performs a competitive activity; and\n(b)\nin the case of Singapore, the procuring entity has been privatised.\nWhere government control or influence over the covered procurement of a procuring entity of a Party has been effectively eliminated, the other Party shall not be entitled to compensatory adjustments.\n3.   For any other proposed modification, the modifying Party shall include in the notification information as to the likely consequences of the change for the coverage provided in this Chapter. Where the modifying Party proposes to make minor amendments or technical rectifications of a purely formal nature not affecting covered procurement, it shall notify these modifications at least every two years.\n4.   Where the other Party (hereinafter referred to as ‘objecting Party’) objects to the notification by the modifying Party, the Parties shall seek to resolve the objection through consultations, including if necessary, consultations at the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government Procurement established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees). In such consultations, the Parties shall consider:\n(a)\nevidence pertaining to the effective elimination of government control or influence over an entity's covered procurement in the case of a notification under paragraph 2;\n(b)\nevidence that the proposed modification does not affect coverage in the case of a notification under paragraph 3; and\n(c)\nany claims relating to the need for compensatory adjustments arising from modifications notified according to paragraph 1 or to the level of such adjustments. Such adjustments may consist either of the compensatory expansion of coverage by the modifying Party or of a withdrawal of equivalent coverage by the objecting Party, in both cases with a view to maintaining a balance of rights and obligations and a comparable level of mutually agreed coverage provided in this Chapter.\n5.   The Parties may have recourse to the dispute settlement mechanism under Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) where the objecting Party, after consultations under paragraph 4, considers that one or more of the following situations exist:\n(a)\nin the case of subparagraph 4(a), government control or influence over an entity's covered procurement has not been effectively eliminated;\n(b)\nin the case of subparagraph 4(b), a modification does not meet the criteria in paragraph 3 and which affects coverage, and should be subject to compensatory adjustments; or\n(c)\nin the case of subparagraph 4(c), compensatory adjustments proposed during the consultation between the Parties are not adequate to maintain a comparable level of mutually agreed coverage.\n6.   A proposed modification shall only become effective where:\n(a)\nthe objecting Party has not submitted a written objection to the proposed modification to the modifying Party within 45 days of the date of the notification of the proposed modifications;\n(b)\nthe objecting Party has notified the modifying Party of the withdrawal of its objection;\n(c)\nthe Parties have reached an agreement after due consultations under paragraph 4; or\n(d)\nthe objection has been resolved through the dispute settlement mechanism under paragraph 5.\nARTICLE 9.19\nResponsibilities of the Committee\n1.   In the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government Procurement established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), the Parties may:\n(a)\nadopt modalities for reporting statistical data pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 9.15 (Transparency of Procurement Information);\n(b)\nreview pending notifications of modifications to coverage and endorse updates to the list of entities in Annexes 9-A to 9-C;\n(c)\nendorse compensatory adjustments resulting from modifications affecting coverage;\n(d)\nrevise, where required, indicative criteria that demonstrate the effective elimination of government control or influence over an entity's covered procurement;\n(e)\nadopt criteria for deciding over the level of compensatory adjustments of coverage;\n(f)\nconsider issues regarding government procurement that are referred to it by a Party;\n(g)\nexchange information relating to government procurement opportunities in each Party, including those at sub-central levels; and\n(h)\ndiscuss any other matters related to the operation of this Chapter.\n2.   In the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government Procurement established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), the Parties may take any decision required for the purposes of subparagraphs (a) to (h).\nARTICLE 9.20\nAdjustment to GPA provisions\nIf the Revised GPA is amended or superseded by another agreement, the Parties shall amend this Chapter by decision in the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government Procurement established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), as appropriate.\nCHAPTER TEN\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nARTICLE 10.1\nObjectives\n1.

Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, each Party shall establish systems for the registration and protection of geographical indications in its territory for such categories of wines and spirits and agricultural products and foodstuffs as it deems appropriate.\n2.   The systems referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain elements such as:\n(a)\na domestic register;\n(b)\nan administrative process to verify that the geographical indications entered, or to be entered, on the domestic register referred to in subparagraph 2(a), identify a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that Party's territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to their geographical origin;\n(c)\nan objection procedure that allows the legitimate interests of third parties to be taken into account; and\n(d)\nlegal means that permit the rectification and cancellation of entries on the domestic register referred to in subparagraph 2(a), that take into account the legitimate interests of third parties and the right holders of the registered geographical indications in question.\n3.   The Parties shall, as soon as practicable after the procedures for protection of geographical indications in each Party (48) have been concluded for all the names listed in Annex 10-A, meet to adopt a decision in the Trade Committee referred to under Article 16.1 (Trade Committee) regarding the listing in Annex 10-B of the names from Annex 10-A of each Party that have been and remain protected as geographical indications under the respective Party's system referred to in paragraph 2.\nARTICLE 10.18\nAmendment of List of Geographical Indications\nThe Parties agree on the possibility of amending the list of geographical indications for wines, spirits, agricultural products and foodstuffs listed in Annex 10-B to be protected by each Party under Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications).

Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications for wines, spirits, agricultural products and foodstuffs listed in Annex 10-B that remain protected as geographical indications under its system as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), each Party shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent:\n(a)\nthe use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than its true place of origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good; and\n(b)\nany other use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of Article 10bis (Unfair Competition) of the Paris Convention.\n2.   Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications for wines and spirits listed in Annex 10-B that remain protected as geographical indications under its system as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), each Party shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent the use of any such geographical indication identifying wines for wines not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question or identifying spirits for spirits not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question, even where:\n(a)\nthe true origin of the good is indicated;\n(b)\nthe geographical indication is used in translation; or\n(c)\nthe geographical indication is accompanied by expressions such as ‘kind’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘imitation’, or the like.\n3.   Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs listed in Annex 10-B that remain protected as geographical indications under the Party's system as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), each Party shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent the use of any such geographical indication identifying a good for a like good (49) not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question, even where:\n(a)\nthe true origin of the good is indicated;\n(b)\nthe geographical indication is used in translation (50); or\n(c)\nthe geographical indication is accompanied by expressions such as ‘kind’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘imitation’, or the like.\n4.   Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its provisions in respect of a geographical indication in the case of the failure of a right holder to:\n(a)\nrenew the registration of the geographical indication in that Party's market; or\n(b)\nmaintain minimal commercial activity or interest in the geographical indication in that Party's market, including commercialisation, promotion or market monitoring.\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement, each Party shall determine the practical conditions under which homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other in its territory, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and the need to ensure that consumers are not misled.\n6.   Where a Party receives an application for registration or protection of a geographical indication that is homonymous with one of the geographical indications in Annex 10-B, that Party will take into consideration the views and submissions of the applicant and the producers concerned (51) in determining the conditions under which the homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other.\nARTICLE 10.20\nRight of Use of Geographical Indications\nThe persons who may use a geographical indication protected under Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) are not limited to the applicant, provided that such use relates to the goods as identified by that geographical indication.\nARTICLE 10.21\nRelationship with Trademarks\n1.   Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications listed in Annex 10-B that remain protected as geographical indications under a Party's system as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), the registration of a trademark for goods which contains or consists of a geographical indication that identifies like goods shall be refused or invalidated ex officio if that Party's domestic law so permits, or at the request of an interested party, with respect to goods not having the origin of the geographical indication concerned, provided that the application to register the trademark is submitted after the date of application for the registration of the geographical indication in the territory concerned.\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4, the Parties acknowledge that the existence of a prior conflicting trademark in the territory of a Party would not completely preclude the registration of a subsequent geographical indication for like goods in that Party (52).\n3.   Where a trademark has been applied for or has been registered in good faith, or where rights to a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith, if that possibility is provided by the Parties' respective domestic laws, and such application, registration or acquisition takes place either:\n(a)\nbefore the date of application for protection of the geographical indication in the territory concerned; or\n(b)\nbefore the geographical indication is protected in its country of origin,\nany measures adopted to implement Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall not prejudice the eligibility for or the validity of the registration of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, on the basis that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, a geographical indication.\n4.   The Parties shall have no obligation to protect a geographical indication pursuant to Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) where, in the light of a reputed or well-known trademark, such protection is liable to mislead consumers as to the true identity of the product.\nARTICLE 10.22\nGeneral Rules\n1.   The conditions for import, export and commercialisation of the products referred to in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) in the territory of a Party shall be governed by the domestic law of that Party.\n2.   For agricultural products and foodstuffs, nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to prevent the continued and similar use by any of its nationals or domiciliaries of any geographical indication of the other Party in connection with goods or services, where those nationals or domiciliaries have used that geographical indication in a continuous manner with regard to the same or related goods or services in the territory of that Party either:\n(a)\nfor at least ten years preceding 1st January 2004; or\n(b)\nin good faith preceding that date.\n3.   In relation to the geographical indications to be listed in Annex 10-B, where prior use has been determined pursuant to:\n(a)\nthe opposition proceedings during the domestic registration procedures; or\n(b)\nany legal proceedings,\nsuch prior use shall be listed in Annex 10-B, in respect of the geographical indication in question, in accordance with:\n(i)\nthe mechanism established in paragraph 3 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), in the case of subparagraph 3(a); and\n(ii)\nthe mechanism established in Article 10.18 (Amendment of List of Geographical Indications), in the case of subparagraph 3(b).\n4.   Each Party may determine the practical conditions under which such prior use will be differentiated from the geographical indication in its territory, taking into account the need to ensure that consumers are not misled.\n5.   Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its provisions in respect of a geographical indication of the other Party with respect to goods or services for which the relevant indication is identical to the term customary in common language as the common name for such goods or services in the territory of that Party.\n6.   Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its provisions in respect of any name contained in a geographical indication of the other Party with respect to goods or services for which the name is identical to the term customary in common language as the common name for such goods or services in the territory of that Party.\n7.   Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its provisions in respect of a geographical indication of the other Party with respect to products of the vine for which the relevant indication is identical to the customary name of a grape variety existing in the territory of that Party as of the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement in that Party.\n8.   Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall prevent a Party from protecting as a geographical indication, in accordance with its domestic law, a term that conflicts with the name of a plant variety or animal breed.\n9.   A Party may provide that any request made under Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) in connection with the use or registration of a trademark must be presented within five years after the adverse use of the protected indication has become generally known in that Party or within five years after the date of registration of the trademark in that Party, provided that the trademark has been published by that date, if the date of registration is earlier than the date on which the adverse use became generally known in that Party, and provided that the geographical indication is not used or registered in bad faith.\n10.   Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall prejudice the right of any person to use, in the course of trade, that person's name or the name of that person's predecessor in business, except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.\n11.   Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall oblige a Party to protect a geographical indication of the other Party which is not or has ceased to be protected in accordance with the domestic law of its country of origin. The Parties shall notify each other if a geographical indication ceases to be protected in its country of origin.\nARTICLE 10.23\nRelation to Trade Committee\nThe Trade Committee established pursuant to Article 16.1 (Trade Committee) shall have the authority to:\n(a)\nadopt decisions regarding the listing in Annex 10-B referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications); and\n(b)\namend Annex 10-B in accordance with Article 10.18 (Amendment of List of Geographical Indications).\nSUB-SECTION D\nDESIGNS\nARTICLE 10.24\nRequirements for Protection of Registered Designs (53)\n1.

The Parties affirm their commitments under Articles 41 to 50 of the TRIPS Agreement, and shall provide for the measures, procedures and remedies under their respective domestic law against acts of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, that are in compliance with such commitments.\n2.   In particular, the measures, procedures and remedies referred to in paragraph 1, and provided for by each Party under its domestic law, shall:\n(a)\ntake into account, as appropriate, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the interests of third parties;\n(b)\nbe fair and equitable;\n(c)\nnot be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time limits or unwarranted delays; and\n(d)\nbe applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.\n3.   Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the capacity of either Party to enforce its domestic law in general or create any obligation on either Party to amend its existing laws as they relate to the enforcement of intellectual property rights. Without prejudice to the foregoing general principles, nothing in this Chapter shall create any obligation on either Party:\n(a)\nto put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights that is distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general; or\n(b)\nwith respect to the distribution of resources as between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.\nARTICLE 10.37\nPublication of Judicial Decisions\nIn civil judicial proceedings instituted for infringement of an intellectual property right, each Party shall take appropriate measures, pursuant to its domestic law and policies, to publish or make available to the public information on final judicial decisions.

Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to adopt provisional measures inaudita altera parte where appropriate, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holder or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed. In proceedings conducted inaudita altera parte, each Party shall provide its judicial authorities with the authority to act expeditiously on requests for provisional measures and to make a decision without undue delay.\n3.   At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and in cases of trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities, have the authority to order the seizure or taking into custody of suspect goods, of materials and implements relevant to the act of infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, of documentary evidence, either original or copies thereof, relevant to the infringement.\n4.   Each Party shall provide that its authorities have the authority to require the applicant, with respect to provisional measures, to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant's right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to procedures for such provisional measures.\n5.   Where the provisional measures are revoked, or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, upon the request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by those measures.\nARTICLE 10.40\nEvidence and Right of Information\n1.   Without prejudice to each Party's domestic law governing privilege, the protection of confidentiality or the processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities have the authority, upon a justified request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged infringer, to provide, to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its applicable laws and regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls.\n2.   The relevant information referred to in paragraph 1 may include information regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and regarding the means of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved in the production and distribution of such goods or services and of their channels of distribution.\nARTICLE 10.41\nOther Remedies\n1.   Each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of a right holder's intellectual property right, its judicial authorities shall, upon application by the right holder, have the authority, at least with respect to pirated copyright goods and counterfeit trademark goods, to order:\n(a)\nthat such infringing goods, without compensation of any sort, be:\n(i)\ndestroyed, except in exceptional circumstances; or\n(ii)\ndisposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm caused to the right holder; and\n(b)\nthat materials and implements, the predominant use of which has been in the manufacture or creation of such infringing goods, shall be, without undue delay and without compensation of any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimise the risks of further infringements.\n2.   In considering any application by a right holder, as referred to in paragraph 1, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the interests of third parties shall be taken into account.\n3.   The remedies under this Article may be carried out at the expense of the infringer.\nARTICLE 10.42\nInjunctions\nEach Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of a right holder's intellectual property right, its judicial authorities shall, upon application by the right holder, have the authority to issue against the infringer or, where appropriate, against a third party over whom the relevant judicial authority exercises jurisdiction, an injunction aimed at prohibiting the continuation of the infringement. Where provided for by the Party's domestic law, non-compliance with an injunction shall, where appropriate, be subject to a recurring penalty payment with a view to ensuring compliance.\nARTICLE 10.43\nAlternative Measures\nEach Party may provide in its domestic law that, in civil judicial proceedings where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of a right holder's intellectual property right, in appropriate cases and on application by the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in Article 10.41 (Other Remedies) and/or Article 10.42 (Injunctions), its judicial authorities have the authority to order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in Article 10.41 (Other Remedies) and/or Article 10.42 (Injunctions), provided that the applicant acted unintentionally and without negligence, the execution of the measures in question would cause disproportionate harm to the applicant, and pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory (67).\nARTICLE 10.44\nDamages\n1.   Each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer who, knowingly or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered as a result of the infringement.\n2.   In determining the amount of damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, a Party's judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, inter alia, any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or services measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price (68). At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder the infringer's profits that are attributable to the infringement, whether as an alternative to or in addition to or as part of the damages.\n3.   As an alternative to paragraph 2, each Party may provide that its judicial authorities have the authority, in appropriate cases, to set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.\n4.   Nothing in this Article precludes either Party from providing that where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, its judicial authorities may order the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established.\nARTICLE 10.45\nLegal Costs\nEach Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, where appropriate, have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning infringement of intellectual property rights, that the prevailing party be awarded payment by the losing party of court costs or fees and appropriate attorney's fees, or any other expenses as provided for under that Party's domestic law.\nARTICLE 10.46\nPresumptions Relating to Copyright and Related Rights\nIn civil proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption that, at least with respect to a literary or artistic work, performance or phonogram, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the natural or legal person whose name appears on such work, performance or phonogram in the usual manner, is the right holder and is consequently entitled to institute infringement proceedings.\nARTICLE 10.47\nLiability of Intermediary Service Providers\n1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 to 6, each Party shall provide for exemptions or limitations in its domestic law regarding the liability of, or scope of remedies available against, service providers for infringements of copyright or related rights or trademarks that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.\n2.   The exemptions or limitations referred to in paragraph 1:\n(a)\nshall cover the functions of:\n(i)\ntransmitting (69), or providing access for material without selection and/or modification of its content (70); and\n(ii)\ncaching carried out through an automatic process (71); and\n(b)\nmay also cover the functions of:\n(i)\nstorage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and\n(ii)\nreferring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories.\n3.   Eligibility for the exemptions or limitations in this Article may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures.\n4.   Each Party may prescribe in its domestic law, conditions for service providers to qualify for the exemptions or limitations in this Article. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 3, each Party may establish appropriate procedures for effective notifications of claimed infringement and effective counter-notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification.\n5.   This Article is without prejudice to the availability of defences to the infringement of copyright or related rights, or trademarks, that are of general applicability. This Article shall not affect the possibility of the court or administrative authority of a Party, in accordance with its legal system, requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement.\n6.   Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address future functions of a nature similar to those addressed in this Article.\nSECTION D\nBORDER MEASURES\nARTICLE 10.48\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Section:\n(a)\n‘counterfeit geographical indication goods’ means any goods, including packaging, bearing, without authorisation, a sign which is identical to the geographical indication validly registered in respect of such goods in the territory where the goods are, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a geographical indication and which thereby infringes the rights of the owner or holder of the geographical indication in question under the domestic law of the Party where the goods are;\n(b)\n‘counterfeit trademark goods’ means any goods, including packaging bearing, without authorisation, a trademark which is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark and which thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the domestic law of the Party where the goods are;\n(c)\n‘goods in transit’ means goods the passage of which across the territory of a Party, with or without transhipment, whether or not landed in the territory of the Party, warehousing, breaking bulk, or change in the mode of transport or conveyance, is only a portion of a complete journey beginning and terminating beyond the frontier of the Party across which territory the traffic passes;\n(d)\n‘pirated copyright goods’ means any goods which are copies made without the consent of the right holder or of a person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production, and which are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the domestic law of the Party where the goods are; and\n(e)\n‘pirated design goods’ means any goods in respect of which the design is registered and to which that design or a design not substantially different from it has been applied without the consent of the right holder or of a person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production, where the making of those goods would have constituted an infringement under the domestic law of the Party where the goods are.\nARTICLE 10.49\nScope of Border Measures\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3, each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures with respect to goods under customs control under which a right holder may request its competent authorities to suspend the release of suspect:\n(a)\ncounterfeit trademark goods;\n(b)\npirated copyright goods;\n(c)\ncounterfeit geographical indication goods; and\n(d)\npirated design goods.\n2.   Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures with respect to goods under customs control, under which its competent authorities may act upon their own initiative to suspend the release of suspect (72):\n(a)\ncounterfeit trademark goods;\n(b)\npirated copyright goods; and\n(c)\ncounterfeit geographical indication goods.\n3.   The Parties shall not have the obligation to provide for the procedures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 with regards to goods in transit. This is without prejudice to paragraph 2 of Article 10.51 (Cooperation).\n4.   Singapore shall fully implement the obligations of paragraphs 1 and 2 ideally within two but no later than three years of the entry into force of this Agreement with regard to procedures with respect to:\n(a)\ncounterfeit geographical indication goods; and\n(b)\npirated design goods.\nARTICLE 10.50\nIdentification of Shipments\nTo facilitate the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights, the customs authorities shall adopt a range of approaches to identify shipments containing counterfeit trademark goods, pirated copyright goods, pirated design goods, and counterfeit geographical indication goods. These approaches include risk analysis techniques based, inter alia, on information provided by right holders, intelligence gathered and cargo inspections.\nARTICLE 10.51\nCooperation\n1.   The Parties agree to cooperate with a view to eliminating international trade in goods that infringe intellectual property rights. For this purpose, they shall, in particular, exchange information and arrange for cooperation, to be mutually agreed between their customs authorities, with regard to trade in counterfeit trademark goods, pirated copyright goods, pirated design goods, or counterfeit geographical indication goods.\n2.   For shipments of goods transiting or transhipped through the territory of a Party and destined for the territory of the other Party, which are suspected of being counterfeit or pirated, the Parties shall, upon their own initiative or upon the request of the other Party, provide available information to the other Party to enable effective enforcement against those shipments. The Parties may not provide information which is submitted confidentially by the shipper, shipping line or its agent.\nSECTION E\nCOOPERATION\nARTICLE 10.52\nCooperation\n1.   The Parties agree to cooperate with a view to supporting the implementation of the commitments and obligations undertaken under this Chapter. Areas of cooperation include, but are not limited to, the following activities:\n(a)\nexchange of information on legal frameworks concerning intellectual property rights, including implementation of intellectual property legislation and systems, aimed at promoting the efficient registration of intellectual property rights;\n(b)\nexchange, between respective authorities responsible for the enforcement of intellectual property rights, of their experiences and best practices concerning enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n(c)\nexchange of information and cooperation on public outreach and appropriate initiatives to promote awareness of the benefits of intellectual property rights and systems;\n(d)\ncapacity-building and technical cooperation in relation, but not limited, to: management, licensing, valuation and exploitation of intellectual property rights; technology and market intelligence; facilitation of industry collaborations, including on intellectual property rights that may be applied towards environmental conservation or enhancement, which may include establishing a platform or database; and public private partnerships to support culture and innovation;\n(e)\nexchange of information and cooperation on intellectual property issues, where appropriate and relevant to developments in environmentally friendly technology; and\n(f)\nany other areas of cooperation or activities as may be discussed and agreed between the Parties.\n2.

Cooperation under this Article shall be carried out subject to each Party's laws, rules, regulations, directives or policies. Cooperation shall also be on mutually agreed terms and conditions and be subject to the availability of resources of each Party.\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\nCOMPETITION AND RELATED MATTERS\nSECTION A\nANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT AND MERGERS\nARTICLE 11.1\nPrinciples\n1.   The Parties recognise the importance of free and undistorted competition in their trade relations. They acknowledge that anti-competitive business conduct and anti-competitive transactions have the potential to distort the proper functioning of their markets and undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation.\n2.   To promote free and undistorted competition in all sectors of their economy, each Party shall maintain in its respective territory comprehensive legislation which effectively addresses the following practices, where such practices affect trade between the Parties:\n(a)\nhorizontal and vertical agreements (73) between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings, and concerted practices, which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;\n(b)\nabuses by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; and\n(c)\nconcentrations between undertakings which result in a substantial lessening of competition or which significantly impede effective competition, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a substantial part thereof.\nARTICLE 11.2\nImplementation\n1.   Each Party shall maintain its autonomy in developing and enforcing its law. The Parties undertake, however, to maintain authorities that are responsible for, and appropriately equipped to effectively enforce the legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 11.1 (Principles).\n2.   The Parties will apply their respective legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 11.1 (Principles) in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, respecting the principles of procedural fairness and the rights of defence of the parties concerned, including the right of the parties concerned to be heard prior to the taking of a decision in a case.\nSECTION B\nPUBLIC UNDERTAKINGS, UNDERTAKINGS ENTRUSTED WITH SPECIAL OR EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS AND STATE MONOPOLIES\nARTICLE 11.3\nPublic Undertakings and Undertakings Entrusted with Special or Exclusive Rights\n1.   Nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from establishing or maintaining public undertakings, or entrusting undertakings with special or exclusive rights according to its respective law.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that public undertakings and undertakings that are entrusted with special or exclusive rights are subject to the legislation referred to in Section A (Anti-Competitive Conduct and Mergers), insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that undertakings entrusted with special or exclusive rights do not use those special or exclusive rights to engage either directly or indirectly, including through their dealings with their parents, subsidiaries, or other undertakings with common ownership, in anti-competitive practices in another market in respect of which such undertakings have no special or exclusive rights, that adversely affect investments, trade in goods or services of the other Party.\n4.   Singapore shall ensure that any public undertaking and any undertaking entrusted with special or exclusive rights acts solely in accordance with commercial considerations in its purchase or sale of goods or services, such as with regard to price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and other terms and conditions of purchase or sale, and provides non-discriminatory treatment to establishments of the Union, to goods of the Union, and to service suppliers of the Union.\nARTICLE 11.4\nState Monopolies\nWhile nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from designating or maintaining state monopolies, each Party shall adjust state monopolies of a commercial character to ensure no discrimination is exercised by such monopolies regarding the conditions under which goods and services are procured from and marketed to natural or legal persons of the other Party.\nSECTION C\nSUBSIDIES\nARTICLE 11.5\nDefinition and Scope\n1.   For the purposes of this Agreement, a subsidy is a measure which fulfils the conditions set out in Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement, mutatis mutandis, irrespective of whether the subsidy is granted in relation to the production of goods or of services (74).\n2.   Subsidies shall be subject to this Chapter only if they are specific, within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement. Any subsidy falling under Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies) shall be deemed to be specific.\n3.   Articles 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies), 11.8 (Other Subsidies) and 11.10 (Review Clause) and Annex 11-A shall not apply to fisheries subsidies, subsidies related to products covered by Annex 1 of the Agreement on Agriculture and other subsidies covered by the Agreement on Agriculture.\nARTICLE 11.6\nRelationship with the WTO\nThe provisions in this Section are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of a Party under the WTO Agreement, in particular to apply trade remedies or to engage in dispute settlement proceedings or other appropriate action against a subsidy granted by the other Party.\nARTICLE 11.7\nProhibited Subsidies\n1.   With respect to subsidies related to trade in goods, the Parties affirm their rights and obligations under Article 3 of the SCM Agreement, which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.\n2.   The following subsidies related to trade in goods and services shall be prohibited unless the subsidising Party upon the request of the other Party has demonstrated that the subsidy in question does not affect trade of the other Party nor will be likely to do so:\n(a)\nany legal arrangements whereby a government or any public body is responsible for covering debts or liabilities of certain undertakings without any limitation in law or in fact as to the amount of those debts and liabilities or the duration of such responsibility; and\n(b)\nany support to insolvent or ailing undertakings in whatever form (such as loans and guarantees, cash grants, capital injections, provision of assets below market prices, tax exemptions) without a credible restructuring plan, based on realistic assumptions, with a view to ensuring the return of the ailing undertaking to long-term viability within a reasonable time, and without the undertaking itself significantly contributing to the costs of restructuring (75).\n3.   Subparagraphs 2(a) and 2(b) do not prevent a Party from providing subsidies to remedy a serious disturbance in its economy. A serious disturbance in the economy of a Party means an exceptional, temporary and significant crisis which affects the whole economy of the Party rather than a specific region or economic sector of that Party.\n4.   Subparagraph 2(b) does not apply to subsidies granted as compensation for carrying out public service obligations nor to subsidies to the coal industry.\nARTICLE 11.8\nOther Subsidies\n1.   The Parties agree to use their best endeavours to apply their competition law or other laws to remedy or remove distortions of competition caused by other specific subsidies related to trade in goods and services which are not covered by Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies), insofar as they affect or are likely to affect trade of either Party, and also to prevent the occurrence of such situations. Annex 11-A contains guidance in particular on the types of subsidies which do not produce these effects.\n2.   The Parties agree to exchange information at the request of either Party and hold a first dialogue within two years of the entry into force of this Agreement with a view to developing rules applicable to other subsidies, taking into account developments at multilateral level. To that end, the Parties may take a decision in the Trade Committee.\nARTICLE 11.9\nTransparency\n1.   Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of subsidies that relate to trade in goods or to the supply of services. To that end, each Party shall report every two years to the other Party on the legal basis, the form, and to the extent possible, the amount or budget, and the recipients of subsidies granted by its government or any public body.\n2.   Such report shall be deemed to have been provided if the relevant information was made available by the Parties, or on their behalf, on a publicly accessible website by June of the second calendar year after the subsidies were granted.\nARTICLE 11.10\nReview Clause\nThe Parties shall keep under constant review the matters to which reference is made in this Section. Each Party may refer such matters to the Trade Committee. The Parties agree to review progress in implementing this Section every two years after the entry into force of this Agreement, unless both Parties agree otherwise.\nSECTION D\nGENERAL MATTERS\nARTICLE 11.11\nCooperation and Coordination in Law Enforcement\nThe Parties recognise the importance of cooperation and coordination to further enhance effective law enforcement. Their respective authorities shall endeavour to coordinate and cooperate in the enforcement of their respective laws to fulfil the objective of this Agreement of free and undistorted competition in their trade relations.\nARTICLE 11.12\nConfidentiality\n1.   When a Party communicates information under this Agreement, that Party shall ensure the protection of business secrets and other confidential information.\n2.   When a Party communicates information in confidence under this Agreement, the receiving Party shall, consistent with its laws and regulations, maintain the confidentiality of that communicated information.\nARTICLE 11.13\nConsultation\n1.   To foster mutual understanding between the Parties or to address specific matters that arise under Section A (Anti-Competitive Conduct and Mergers), Section B (Public Undertakings, Undertakings Entrusted with Special or Exclusive Rights and State Monopolies) or Section D (General Matters), each Party upon the request of the other Party, shall enter into consultations regarding representations made by the other Party. In its requests, the Party shall indicate, if relevant, how the matter affects trade between the Parties.\n2.   The Parties shall promptly discuss, upon the request of a Party, any questions arising from the interpretation or application of Section A (Anti-Competitive Conduct and Mergers), Section B (Public Undertakings, Undertakings Entrusted with Special or Exclusive Rights and State Monopolies) or Section D (General Matters).\n3.   To facilitate discussion of the matter that is the subject of the consultations, each Party shall endeavour to provide relevant non-confidential information to the other Party.\nARTICLE 11.14\nDispute Settlement and Mediation Mechanism\nNeither Party may have recourse to Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) and Chapter Fifteen (Mediation Mechanism) for any matter arising under this Chapter except for Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies).\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nTRADE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\nSECTION A\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS\nARTICLE 12.1\nContext and Objectives\n1.   The Parties recall the Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development of 1992, the Preamble to the WTO Agreement, the Singapore Ministerial Declaration of the WTO of 1996, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation on Sustainable Development of 2002, the Ministerial Declaration of the UN Economic and Social Council on Generating Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work for All of 2006, and the International Labour Organization (hereinafter referred to as ‘ILO’) Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization of 2008. In view of these instruments, the Parties reaffirm their commitment to developing and promoting international trade and their bilateral trade and economic relationship in such a way as to contribute to sustainable development.\n2.   The Parties recognise that economic development, social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development. They underline the benefit of cooperation on trade-related social and environmental issues as part of a global approach to trade and sustainable development.\n3.   The Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded by their domestic labour and environment law. At the same time, the Parties stress that environmental and labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes.\n4.   The Parties recognise that it is their aim to strengthen their trade relations and cooperation in ways that promote sustainable development in the context of paragraphs 1 and 2. In light of the specific circumstances of each Party, it is not their intention to harmonise the labour or environment standards of the Parties.\nARTICLE 12.2\nRight to Regulate and Levels of Protection\n1.   The Parties recognise the right of each Party to establish its own levels of environmental and labour protection, and to adopt or modify its relevant laws and policies accordingly, consistent with the principles of the internationally recognised standards or agreements to which it is party, referred to in Articles 12.3 (Multilateral Labour Standards and Agreements) and 12.6 (Multilateral Environmental Standards and Agreements).\n2.   The Parties shall continue to improve those laws and policies, and shall strive towards providing and encouraging high levels of environmental and labour protection.\nSECTION B\nTRADE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – LABOUR ASPECTS (76)\nARTICLE 12.3\nMultilateral Labour Standards and Agreements\n1.   The Parties recognise the value of international cooperation and agreements on employment and labour affairs as a response of the international community to economic, employment and social challenges and opportunities resulting from globalisation. They commit to consulting and cooperating as appropriate on trade-related labour and employment issues of mutual interest.\n2.   The Parties affirm their commitments, under the Ministerial Declaration of the UN Economic and Social Council on Generating Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work for All of 2006, to recognising full and productive employment and decent work for all as a key element of sustainable development for all countries and as a priority objective of international cooperation. The Parties resolve to promote the development of international trade in a way that is conducive to full and productive employment and decent work for all.\n3.   In accordance with the obligations assumed under the ILO and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 86th Session in Geneva, June 1998, the Parties commit to respecting, promoting and effectively implementing the principles concerning the fundamental rights at work, namely:\n(a)\nthe freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;\n(b)\nthe elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour;\n(c)\nthe effective abolition of child labour; and\n(d)\nthe elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\nThe Parties affirm the commitment to effectively implementing the ILO Conventions that Singapore and the Member States of the Union have ratified respectively.\n4.   The Parties will make continued and sustained efforts towards ratifying and effectively implementing the fundamental ILO conventions, and they will exchange information in this regard. The Parties will also consider the ratification and effective implementation of other ILO conventions, taking into account domestic circumstances. The Parties will exchange information in this regard.\n5.   The Parties recognise that the violation of fundamental principles and rights at work cannot be invoked or otherwise used as a legitimate comparative advantage.\nARTICLE 12.4\nLabour Cooperation in the Context of Trade and Sustainable Development\nThe Parties recognise the importance of working together on trade-related aspects of labour policies in order to achieve the objectives of this Agreement. The Parties may initiate cooperative activities of mutual benefit in areas including, but not limited to:\n(a)\ncooperation in international fora addressing labour aspects of trade and sustainable development, including, but not limited to, the ILO and Asia-Europe Meeting;\n(b)\nthe exchange of information and the sharing of best practices in areas such as labour law and practices, compliance and enforcement systems, labour dispute management, labour consultation, labour-management cooperation and occupational safety and health;\n(c)\nthe exchange of views on the positive and negative impacts of this Agreement on labour aspects of sustainable development and on ways to enhance, prevent or mitigate those impacts, taking into account sustainability impact assessments carried out by either or both Parties;\n(d)\nthe exchange of views on the promotion of the ratification of fundamental ILO Conventions and other conventions of mutual interest, as well as on the effective implementation of ratified conventions;\n(e)\ncooperation on trade-related aspects of the ILO Decent Work Agenda, including on the interlinkages between trade and full and productive employment, labour market adjustment, core labour standards, labour statistics, human resources development and lifelong learning, social protection and social inclusion, social dialogue and gender equality; and\n(f)\nthe exchange of views on the trade impact of labour regulations, norms and standards.\nARTICLE 12.5\nScientific Information\nEach Party, when preparing and implementing measures aimed at health and safety at work which may affect trade or investment between the Parties, shall take account of relevant scientific and technical information and related international standards, guidelines or recommendations, if available, including the precautionary principle as enshrined in such international standards, guidelines or recommendations.\nSECTION C\nTRADE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS\nARTICLE 12.6\nMultilateral Environmental Standards and Agreements\n1.   The Parties recognise the value of international environmental governance and agreements as a response of the international community to global or regional environmental problems, and they stress the need to enhance the mutual supportiveness between trade and environment policies, rules and measures. In this context, they will consult and cooperate as appropriate with respect to negotiations on trade-related environmental issues of mutual interest.\n2.   The Parties shall effectively implement, in their respective laws, regulations or other measures and practices in their territories, the multilateral environmental agreements to which they are party (77).\n3.   The Parties affirm their commitment to reaching the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as ‘UNFCCC’), and to effectively implementing the UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement of 12 December 2015 in a manner consistent with the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC. They commit to work together to strengthen the multilateral, rules-based regime under the UNFCCC building on the UNFCCC's agreed decisions, and to support efforts to develop a post-2020 international climate change agreement under the UNFCCC applicable to all parties.\n4.   Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures to implement the multilateral environmental agreements to which they are party, provided that such measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties or a disguised restriction on trade.\nARTICLE 12.7\nTrade in Timber and Timber Products\nThe Parties recognise the importance of the global conservation and sustainable management of forests. To that end, the Parties undertake to:\n(a)\nexchange information on approaches to promote the trade in, and the consumption of, timber and timber products from legally and sustainably managed forests, and to promote the awareness of such approaches;\n(b)\npromote global forest law enforcement and governance and to address trade in illegally harvested timber and timber products through, for example, promoting the use of timber and timber products from legally and sustainably managed forests, including through verification and certification schemes;\n(c)\ncooperate to promote the effectiveness of measures or policies aimed at addressing the trade in illegally harvested timber and timber products; and\n(d)\npromote the effective use of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with regard to timber species whose conservation status is considered at risk.\nARTICLE 12.8\nTrade in Fish Products\nThe Parties recognise the importance of ensuring the conservation and management of fish stocks in a sustainable manner. To that end, the Parties undertake to:\n(a)\ncomply with long-term conservation measures and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks as defined in the international instruments ratified by the respective Parties and to uphold the principles of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (hereinafter referred to as ‘FAO’) and relevant UN instruments relating to these issues;\n(b)\nintroduce and implement effective measures to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (hereinafter referred to as ‘IUU’) fishing, including by cooperating with Regional Fisheries Managements Organisations and implementing their Catch Documentation or Certification Schemes for the export of fish and fish products, when required, and the Parties shall also facilitate the elimination of IUU products from trade flows and the exchange of information on IUU activities;\n(c)\nadopt effective monitoring and control measures to ensure compliance with conservation measures, such as appropriate Port State Measures; and\n(d)\nuphold the principles of the FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas and respect the relevant provisions of the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU Fishing.\nARTICLE 12.9\nScientific Information\nEach Party, when preparing and implementing measures aimed at environmental protection which may affect trade or investment between the Parties, shall take account of scientific evidence and relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where available, and of the precautionary principle.\nARTICLE 12.10\nCooperation on Environmental Aspects in the Context of Trade and Sustainable Development\nThe Parties recognise the importance of working together on trade-related aspects of environmental policies in order to achieve the objectives of this Agreement. The Parties may initiate cooperative activities of mutual benefit in areas including, but not limited to:\n(a)\nthe exchange of views on the positive and negative impacts of this Agreement on environmental aspects of sustainable development and ways to enhance, prevent or mitigate those impacts, taking into account sustainability impact assessments carried out by either or both Parties;\n(b)\ncooperation in international fora addressing environmental aspects of trade and sustainable development, including in particular in the WTO, under the United Nations Environment Programme and under multilateral environmental agreements;\n(c)\ncooperation with a view to promoting the ratification and effective implementation of multilateral environmental agreements with relevance to trade;\n(d)\nthe exchange of information and cooperation on private and public certification and labelling schemes, including eco-labelling, and on green public procurement;\n(e)\nthe exchange of views on the trade impact of environmental regulations, norms and standards;\n(f)\ncooperation on trade-related aspects of the current and future international climate change regime, including ways to address adverse effects of trade on climate, as well as means to promote low-carbon technologies and energy efficiency;\n(g)\ncooperation on trade related aspects of multilateral environmental agreements, including customs cooperation;\n(h)\ncooperation on sustainable forest management to encourage effective measures for certification of sustainably produced timber;\n(i)\nthe exchange of views on the relationship between multilateral environmental agreements and international trade rules;\n(j)\nthe exchange of views on the liberalisation of environmental goods and services; and\n(k)\nthe exchange of views regarding conservation and management of the living marine resources.\nSECTION D\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nARTICLE 12.11\nTrade and Investment Promoting Sustainable Development\n1.   The Parties resolve to make continuing special efforts to facilitate and promote trade and investment in environmental goods and services, including through addressing related non-tariff barriers. The Parties also recognise the usefulness of efforts to promote trade in goods that are the subject of voluntary or private sustainable development assurance schemes, such as eco-labelling, or fair and ethical trade.\n2.   The Parties shall pay special attention to facilitating the removal of obstacles to trade or investment concerning climate-friendly goods and services, such as sustainable renewable energy goods and related services and energy efficient products and services, including through the adoption of policy frameworks conducive to the deployment of best available technologies and through the promotion of standards that respond to environmental and economic needs and minimise technical obstacles to trade.\n3.   The Parties recognise the need to ensure that, when developing public support systems for fossils fuels, proper account is taken of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and of the need to limit distortions of trade as much as possible. While subparagraph 2(b) of Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies) does not apply to subsidies to the coal industry, the Parties share the goal of progressively reducing subsidies for fossil fuels. Such reductions may be accompanied by measures to alleviate the social consequences associated with the transition to low carbon fuels. In addition, both Parties will actively promote the development of a sustainable and safe low-carbon economy, such as through investment in renewable energies and energy efficient solutions.\n4.   When promoting trade and investment, the Parties should make special efforts to promote corporate social responsibility practices which are adopted on a voluntary basis. In this regard, each Party shall refer to relevant internationally accepted principles, standards or guidelines to which it has agreed or acceded, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Global Compact, and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. The Parties commit to exchanging information and cooperating on promoting corporate social responsibility.\nARTICLE 12.12\nUpholding Levels of Protection\n1.   A Party shall not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, its environmental and labour laws, in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties.\n2.   A Party shall not fail to effectively enforce its environmental and labour laws, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, where such failure to effectively enforce would affect trade or investment between the Parties.\nARTICLE 12.13\nTransparency\nEach Party shall ensure that where any measure of general application aimed at protecting the environment or labour conditions may affect trade and investment between the Parties, such measure is developed, introduced and administered in a transparent manner and with due notice and opportunities for interested persons to submit their views, in accordance with that Party's domestic law and with Chapter Thirteen (Transparency).\nARTICLE 12.14\nReview of Impact on Sustainable Development\n1.   The Parties undertake to jointly or independently monitor, assess and review the impact of the implementation of this Agreement on sustainable development through their relevant participative processes and institutions, in accordance with their existing practices.\n2.   The Parties will exchange views on methodologies and indicators for trade sustainability impact assessments.\nARTICLE 12.15\nInstitutional Set up and Monitoring Mechanism\n1.   Each Party shall designate an office within its administration that shall serve as contact point with the other Party for the purpose of implementing this Chapter.\n2.   The Parties shall establish a Board on Trade and Sustainable Development (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Board’). The Board shall comprise senior officials from within the administration of each Party.\n3.   The Board shall meet within the first two years after the date this Agreement enters into force and thereafter as necessary, to oversee the implementation of this Chapter.\n4.   Each meeting of the Board shall include a public session with stakeholders to exchange views on issues related to the implementation of this Chapter. The Parties shall promote a balanced representation of relevant interests, including independent representative organisations of employers, workers, environmental interests and business groups, as well as other relevant stakeholders as appropriate.\n5.   Each Party shall establish new consultative mechanisms or make use of existing consultative mechanisms to seek advice from relevant domestic stakeholders on the implementation of this Chapter, such as domestic advisory groups. Such mechanisms shall include balanced representation of independent economic, social and environmental stakeholders. These stakeholders include employers' and workers' organisations, and non-governmental organisations. These stakeholders may, on their own initiative, submit views or recommendations to their respective Parties on the implementation of this Chapter.\nARTICLE 12.16\nGovernment Consultations\n1.   In case of disagreement on any matter arising under this Chapter, the Parties shall only have recourse to the procedures provided for in Article 12.16 (Government Consultations) and Article 12.17 (Panel of Experts). Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) and Chapter Fifteen (Mediation Mechanism) do not apply to this Chapter.\n2.   In case of any disagreement referred to in paragraph 1, a Party may request consultations with the other Party by delivering a written request to the contact point of the other Party. Consultations shall commence promptly after a Party has delivered a request for consultations.\n3.   The Parties shall make every attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter. The Parties shall take into account the activities of the ILO or relevant multilateral environmental organisations or bodies so as to promote greater cooperation and coherence between the work of the Parties and these organisations. Where relevant, the Parties, subject to mutual agreement, may seek the views of these organisations or bodies, or of any person or body the Parties deem appropriate, in order to fully examine the matter.\n4.   If a Party considers that the matter needs further discussion that Party may request that the Board be convened to consider the matter by delivering a written request to the contact point of the other Party. The Board shall convene promptly and endeavour to agree on a resolution of the matter.\n5.   Where appropriate, the Board may consult relevant stakeholders.\n6.   Any resolution reached by the Board on the matter shall be made public unless it otherwise decides.\nARTICLE 12.17\nPanel of Experts\n1.   For any matter that has not been satisfactorily addressed by the Board within 120 days from the delivery of a request for the Board to convene to consider that matter pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 12.16 (Government Consultations), or within a longer period as agreed by both Parties, a Party may request, by delivering a written request to the contact point of the other Party, that a Panel of Experts be established to examine that matter.\n2.   At its first meeting after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Board shall establish the rules of procedure of the Panel of Experts, taking reference from the relevant Rules of Procedure in Annex 14-A. The principles in Annex 14-B shall apply to this Article.\n3.   At its first meeting after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Board shall establish a list of at least twelve individuals who are willing and able to serve on the Panel of Experts. This list shall be composed of three sub-lists: one sub-list for each Party and one sub-list of individuals who are not nationals of either Party and who shall act as Chairpersons of the Panel of Experts. Each Party shall propose at least four individuals to serve as experts on its own sub-list. Each Party shall also propose at least two individuals to serve on the sub-list of Chairpersons with the agreement of both Parties. At its meetings, the Board will review the list and ensure that it is maintained at least at the level of twelve individuals.\n4.   The list referred to in paragraph 3 shall comprise individuals with specialised knowledge or expertise regarding the issues addressed in this Chapter, regarding labour or environmental law, or regarding the resolution of disputes arising under international agreements. Those individuals shall be independent, shall serve in their individual capacities, and shall neither take instructions from any organisation or government with regard to issues related to the matter at stake nor be affiliated with the government of Singapore, the government of any Member State of the Union, or the Union.\n5.   A Panel of Experts shall be composed of three members, unless the Parties agree otherwise. Within 30 days of the date of receipt by the responding Party of the request for the establishment of a Panel of Experts, the Parties shall consult each other in order to reach an agreement on its composition. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on the composition of the Panel of Experts within this time-frame, they shall select the chairperson from the relevant sub-list referred to in paragraph 3 by mutual agreement or, in case they cannot agree within another seven days, by lot. Each Party shall select one expert who satisfies the requirements of paragraph 4 within 44 days of the date of receipt by the responding Party of the request for the establishment of a Panel of Experts. The Parties may agree on the selection of any other expert who satisfies the requirements of paragraph 4 to sit on the Panel of Experts. In the event that the composition of the Panel of Experts has not been completed within 44 days from the date of receipt by the responding Party of the request for the establishment of a Panel of Experts, the remaining expert(s) shall be selected within seven days by lot from among the individuals on the sub-list(s) referred to in paragraph 3 that was proposed by the Party or Parties that had not completed the procedure. In the event that such list has not yet been established, the experts shall be selected by lot from the individuals who have been formally proposed by one or both of the Parties. The date of establishment of the Panel of Experts shall be the date on which the last of the three experts is selected.\n6.   Unless the Parties agree otherwise within seven days from the date of establishment of the Panel of Experts, the terms of reference of the Panel of Experts shall be:\n‘To examine, in the light of the relevant provisions of the Trade and Sustainable Development Chapter, the matter referred to in the request for the establishment of the Panel of Experts, and to issue a report, in accordance with paragraph 8 of Article 12.17 (Panel of Experts), making recommendations for the solution of the matter’.\n7.   The Panel of Experts may obtain information from any source it deems appropriate. In matters related to the respect of multilateral agreements as set out in Articles 12.3 (Multilateral Labour Standards and Agreements) and 12.6 (Multilateral Environmental Standards and Agreements), the Panel of Experts should seek information and advice from the ILO or Multilateral Environmental Agreement bodies. Any information obtained under this paragraph shall be disclosed to both Parties and submitted to them for their comments.\n8.   The Panel of Experts shall issue an interim and a final report to the Parties. These reports shall set out the findings of facts, the applicability of the relevant provisions, and the basic rationale behind any findings and recommendations. The Panel of Experts shall issue the interim report to the Parties not later than 90 days from its date of establishment. Any Party may submit written comments on the interim report to the Panel of Experts. After considering any such written comments, the Panel of Experts may modify the report and make any further examination it considers appropriate. The Panel of Experts shall issue the final report to the Parties no later than 150 days from its date of establishment. Where it considers that the deadlines set in this paragraph cannot be met, the chairperson of the Panel of Experts shall notify the Parties in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the Panel of Experts plans to issue its interim or final report. The Panel of Experts shall issue the final report no later than 180 days after the date of its establishment, unless the Parties agree otherwise. This final report shall be made publicly available unless the Parties decide otherwise.\n9.   The Parties shall discuss the appropriate measures to be implemented, taking into account the report and recommendations of the Panel of Experts. The Party concerned shall inform its stakeholders, through the consultative mechanisms referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 12.15 (Institutional Set Up and Monitoring Mechanism), and the other Party, of its decisions on any actions or measures to be implemented, no later than three months after the report has been submitted to the Parties. The follow-up to the report and the recommendations of the Panel of Experts shall be monitored by the Board. Stakeholders may submit observations to the Board in this regard.\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\nTRANSPARENCY\nARTICLE 13.1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Chapter:\n(a)\n‘measure of general application’ means laws, regulations, judicial decisions, procedures and administrative rulings that may have an impact on any matter covered by this Agreement but does not include a ruling that applies to a particular person; and\n(b)\n‘interested person’ means any natural or legal person that may be subject to any rights or obligations under measures of general application.\nARTICLE 13.2\nObjectives and Scope\n1.

The arbitration panel shall, at the written request of both Parties, suspend its work at any time for a period agreed by the Parties, which shall not exceed twelve months. The arbitration panel shall resume its work at the end of this agreed period at the written request of the complaining Party, or before the end of this agreed period at the written request of both Parties. If the complaining Party does not request the resumption of the arbitration panel's work before the expiry of the agreed period, the dispute settlement procedures initiated pursuant to this Section shall be deemed terminated. Subject to Article 14.21 (Relation with WTO Obligations), the suspension and termination of the arbitration panel's work are without prejudice to the rights of either Party in other proceedings.\n2.   At any time, the Parties may agree in writing to terminate the dispute settlement procedures initiated pursuant to this Section.\nARTICLE 14.15\nMutually Agreed Solution\nThe Parties may reach a mutually agreed solution to a dispute under this Chapter at any time. They shall notify the Trade Committee and the arbitration panel, if any, of such solution. If the solution requires approval pursuant to the relevant domestic procedures of either Party, the notification shall refer to this requirement, and the dispute settlement procedure initiated pursuant to this Section shall be suspended. The procedure shall be terminated if such approval is not required or upon notification of the completion of any such domestic procedures.\nARTICLE 14.16\nRules of Procedure\n1.   Dispute settlement procedures under this Chapter shall be governed by Annex 14-A.\n2.   Any meetings of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public in accordance with Annex 14-A.\nARTICLE 14.17\nSubmission of Information\n1.   At the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the arbitration panel may obtain information from any source it deems appropriate for the arbitration panel proceedings, including from the Parties involved in the dispute. The arbitration panel also has the right to seek the relevant opinions of experts as it deems appropriate. The arbitration panel shall consult the Parties before choosing such experts. Any information obtained in this manner must be disclosed to the Parties and submitted for their comments.\n2.   Interested natural and legal persons of the Parties are authorised to submit amicus curiae briefs to the arbitration panel in accordance with Annex 14-A.\nARTICLE 14.18\nRules of Interpretation\nThe arbitration panel shall interpret the provisions referred to in Article 14.2 (Scope) in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including those codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Where an obligation under this Agreement is identical to an obligation under the WTO Agreement, the arbitration panel shall take into account any relevant interpretation established in rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (hereinafter referred to as the ‘DSB’). The rulings of the arbitration panel shall not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in the provisions referred to in Article 14.2 (Scope).\nARTICLE 14.19\nArbitration Panel Decisions and Rulings\n1.   The arbitration panel shall make every effort to take any decision by consensus. Where, nevertheless, a decision cannot be reached by consensus, the matter at issue shall be decided by majority vote.\n2.   Any ruling of the arbitration panel shall be binding on the Parties and shall not create any rights or obligations to physical or legal persons. The ruling shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions referred to in Article 14.2 (Scope), and the rationale behind any findings and conclusions that it makes. The Trade Committee shall make the ruling of the arbitration panel publicly available in its entirety, unless it decides not to do so in order to ensure the confidentiality of any information designated by either Party as confidential.\nSECTION D\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nARTICLE 14.20\nLists of Arbitrators\n1.   Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall establish a list of five individuals who are willing and able to serve as the chairperson of an arbitration panel referred to in Article 14.5 (Establishment of the Arbitration Panel).\n2.   No later than six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Trade Committee shall establish a list of at least ten individuals who are willing and able to serve as arbitrators. Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, each Party shall propose at least five individuals to serve as arbitrators.\n3.   The Trade Committee will ensure that the list of individuals to serve as chairpersons or arbitrators, established pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, are maintained.\n4.   Arbitrators shall have specialised knowledge of or experience in law and international trade or in the settlement of disputes arising under international trade agreements. They shall be independent, shall serve in their individual capacities, shall not be affiliated with the government of either Party, and shall comply with Annex 14-B.\nARTICLE 14.21\nRelation with WTO Obligations\n1.   Recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall be without prejudice to any action in the WTO framework, including dispute settlement proceedings.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where a Party has initiated dispute settlement proceedings with regard to a particular measure, either under this Chapter or under the WTO Agreement, it may not institute dispute settlement proceedings regarding the same measure in the other forum until the first proceedings have ended. Moreover, neither Party shall initiate dispute settlement proceedings under both this Chapter and under the WTO Agreement unless substantially different obligations under both agreements are in dispute, or unless the selected forum fails for procedural or jurisdictional reasons to make findings on the claim seeking redress in relation to that obligation, provided that the failure of the forum is not the result of a failure of a disputing Party to act diligently.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2:\n(a)\ndispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement shall be deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for the establishment of a panel under Article 6 of the DSU and shall be deemed to be ended when the DSB adopts the Panel's report, and the Appellate Body's report as the case may be, under Articles 16 and 17(14) of the DSU; and\n(b)\ndispute settlement proceedings under this Chapter shall be deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for the establishment of an arbitration panel under paragraph 1 of Article 14.4 (Initiation of Arbitration Procedure) and shall be deemed to be ended when the arbitration panel issues its ruling to the Parties and to the Trade Committee under paragraph 2 of Article 14.8 (Arbitration Panel Ruling) or when the parties have reached a mutually agreed solution under Article 14.15 (Mutually Agreed Solution).\n4.   Nothing in this Chapter shall preclude a Party from implementing the suspension of obligations authorised by the DSB. The WTO Agreement shall not be invoked to preclude a Party from suspending obligations as provided for under this Chapter.\nARTICLE 14.22\nTime Limits\n1.   All time limits laid down in this Chapter, including the limits for the arbitration panels to notify their rulings, shall be counted in calendar days, the first day being the day following the acts or facts to which they refer, unless otherwise specified.\n2.   Any time limit referred to in this Chapter may be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties.\nARTICLE 14.23\nReview and Modification of the Chapter\nThe Parties may, by decision in the Trade Committee, modify this Chapter and Annexes 14-A and 14-B.\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nMEDIATION MECHANISM\nARTICLE 15.1\nObjective and Scope\n1.   The objective of this Chapter is to facilitate the finding of a mutually agreed solution through a comprehensive and expeditious procedure with the assistance of a mediator.\n2.   This Chapter shall apply to any measure that is within the scope of this Agreement and that adversely affects trade or investment between the Parties, except as otherwise provided.\nSECTION A\nPROCEDURE UNDER THE MEDIATION MECHANISM\nARTICLE 15.2\nRequest for Information\n1.   At any time before the initiation of the mediation procedure, a Party may request the other Party in writing to provide information regarding a measure that adversely affects trade or investment between the Parties. The Party to which such request is made shall provide a written response within 20 days.\n2.   Where the responding Party considers that it is not practicable to respond within 20 days, it shall inform the requesting Party of the reasons why it is not practicable to respond within this period, together with an estimate of the shortest period within which it will be able to provide its response.\nARTICLE 15.3\nInitiation of the Procedure\n1.   At any time, a Party may request that the Parties enter into a mediation procedure. Such request shall be addressed to the other Party in writing. The request shall be sufficiently detailed to present clearly the concerns of the requesting Party and shall:\n(a)\nidentify the specific measure at issue;\n(b)\nprovide a statement of the alleged adverse effects that the requesting Party believes the measure has, or will have, on trade or investment between the Parties; and\n(c)\nexplain how the requesting Party considers that those effects are linked to the measure.\n2.   The Party to which such request is addressed shall give sympathetic consideration to the request and reply by accepting or rejecting it in writing within ten days of its receipt.\nARTICLE 15.4\nSelection of the Mediator\n1.   The Parties shall endeavour to agree on a mediator no later than 15 days after the receipt of the reply to the request referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 15.3 (Initiation of the Procedure).\n2.   If the Parties cannot agree on the mediator within the established time frame, either Party may request the chairperson of the Trade Committee or the chairperson's delegate to select the mediator by lot from the list established under paragraph 2 of Article 14.20 (Lists of Arbitrators). Representatives of both Parties are entitled to be present when the lots are drawn.\n3.   The chairperson of the Trade Committee or the chairperson's delegate shall select the mediator within five working days of the request referred to in paragraph 2.\n4.   The mediator shall not be a national of either Party, unless the Parties agree otherwise.\n5.   The mediator shall assist the Parties, in an impartial and transparent manner, in bringing clarity to the measure and its possible adverse effects on trade and investment, and in reaching a mutually agreed solution. Annex 14-B shall apply to mediators, mutatis mutandis. Rules 4 to 9 and Rules 46 to 49 of Annex 14-A shall also apply, mutatis mutandis.\nARTICLE 15.5\nRules of the Mediation Procedure\n1.   Within 10 days after the appointment of the mediator, the Party having invoked the mediation procedure shall present to the mediator and to the other Party a detailed written description of the problem, describing in particular the operation of the measure at issue and its adverse effects on trade and investment. Within 20 days of the date of delivery of that submission, the other Party may provide its written comments on the description of the problem. Either Party may include any information that it deems relevant in its description of the problem or its comments thereon.\n2.   The mediator may decide on the most appropriate way of bringing clarity to the measure concerned and its possible adverse effects on trade and investment. In particular, the mediator may organise meetings between the Parties, may consult the Parties jointly or individually, may seek the assistance of or consult with relevant experts and stakeholders, and may provide any additional support requested by the Parties. However, before seeking the assistance of or consulting with relevant experts and stakeholders, the mediator shall consult with the Parties.\n3.   The mediator may offer advice and may propose a solution for the consideration of the Parties, who may accept or reject the proposed solution or may agree on a different solution. However, the mediator shall not advise or give comments on whether the measure at issue is consistent with this Agreement.\n4.   The mediation procedure shall take place in the territory of the Party to which the request was addressed or, by mutual agreement, at any other location or by any other means.\n5.   The Parties shall endeavour to reach a mutually agreed solution within 60 days of the appointment of the mediator. Pending a final agreement, the Parties may consider possible interim solutions, especially if the measure relates to perishable goods.\n6.   The solution may be adopted by means of a decision of the Trade Committee. Either Party may make such solution subject to the completion of any necessary internal procedures. Mutually agreed solutions shall be made publicly available. However, the version disclosed to the public may not contain any information that a Party has designated as confidential.\n7.   The mediation procedure shall be terminated:\n(a)\nby the adoption of a mutually agreed solution by the Parties, in which case the mediation procedure shall terminate on the date of adoption;\n(b)\nby the mutual agreement of the Parties at any stage of the mediation procedure, in which case the mediation procedure shall terminate on the date of that agreement;\n(c)\nby the written declaration of the mediator, after having consulted with the Parties, that further efforts at mediation would be to no avail, in which case the mediation procedure shall terminate on the date of such declaration; or\n(d)\nby the written declaration of either Party after having explored mutually agreed solutions under the mediation procedure and after having considered any advice and proposed solutions by the mediator, in which case the mediation procedure shall terminate on the date of that declaration.\nSECTION B\nIMPLEMENTATION\nARTICLE 15.6\nImplementation of a Mutually Agreed Solution\n1.   Where the Parties have agreed to a solution, each Party shall take the measures necessary to implement the mutually agreed solution within the agreed timeframe.\n2.   The implementing Party shall inform the other Party in writing of any steps or measures taken to implement the mutually agreed solution.\n3.   At the request of the Parties, the mediator shall issue to the Parties a draft written factual report, which shall provide a brief summary of: (i) the measure at issue in these proceedings; (ii) the procedures followed; and (iii) any mutually agreed solution reached as the final outcome of these proceedings, including possible interim solutions. The mediator shall provide the Parties 15 days to comment on the draft report. After considering the comments of the Parties submitted within that period, the mediator shall submit a final written factual report to the Parties within 15 days. The final written factual report shall not include any interpretation of this Agreement.\nSECTION C\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nARTICLE 15.7\nRelationship to Dispute Settlement\n1.   The mediation procedure is without prejudice to the Parties' rights and obligations under Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement).\n2.   The mediation procedure is not intended to serve as a basis for dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement or any other agreement. A Party shall not rely on or introduce as evidence in such dispute settlement procedures, nor shall an arbitration panel take into consideration:\n(a)\npositions taken by a Party in the course of the mediation procedure;\n(b)\nthe fact that a Party has indicated its willingness to accept a solution to the measure subject to mediation; or\n(c)\nadvice given or proposals made by the mediator.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of Article 15.5 (Rules of the Mediation Procedure), and unless the Parties agree otherwise, all steps of the mediation procedure, including any advice that may be given or solution that may be proposed, are confidential. However, each Party may disclose to the public the fact that mediation is taking place.\nARTICLE 15.8\nTime Limits\nAny time limit referred to in this Chapter may be modified by mutual agreement between the Parties.\nARTICLE 15.9\nCosts\n1.   Each Party shall bear its own expenses arising from the participation in the mediation procedure.\n2.   The Parties shall share equally the expenses that arise from organisational matters, including the remuneration and expenses of the mediator. Remuneration of the mediator shall be in accordance with that provided for in Rule 10(b) of Annex 14-A.\nARTICLE 15.10\nReview\nFive years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall consult each other on the need to modify the mediation procedure in light of their experience of using the mediation procedure and in light of the development of a corresponding mechanism in the WTO.\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nINSTITUTIONAL, GENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nARTICLE 16.1\nTrade Committee\n1.   The Parties hereby establish a Trade Committee, which shall comprise representatives of the Parties.\n2.   The Trade Committee shall meet alternately in the Union or Singapore every two years or without undue delay at the request of either Party.

The Trade Committee may:\n(a)\ndecide to establish or dissolve specialised committees, or to allocate responsibilities to such committees, except that powers granted to specialised committees to adopt legally binding decisions or adopt amendments can only be modified pursuant to the procedure for amendments set out in Article 16.5 (Amendments);\n(b)\ncommunicate with all interested parties, including private sector and civil society organisations;\n(c)\nconsider amendments to this Agreement, or amend provisions of this Agreement in cases specifically provided for in this Agreement;\n(d)\nadopt interpretations of the provisions of this Agreement, which shall be binding on the Parties and on all bodies set up under this Agreement, including the arbitration panels referred to in Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement);\n(e)\nadopt decisions or make recommendations as envisaged by this Agreement;\n(f)\nadopt its own rules of procedure; and\n(g)\ntake any other action in the exercise of its functions as the Parties may agree.\n5.   The Trade Committee shall inform the Joint Committee set up under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of the activities of the Trade Committee and those of its specialised committees, as relevant, at regular meetings of the Joint Committee.\n6.   Recognising the importance of transparency and openness, the Parties affirm their respective practices of considering the views of members of the public in order to draw on a broad range of perspectives in the implementation of this Agreement.\nARTICLE 16.2\nSpecialised Committees\n1.   The following specialised committees are hereby established under the auspices of the Trade Committee:\n(a)\nthe Committee on Trade in Goods;\n(b)\nthe Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the ‘SPS Committee’);\n(c)\nthe Committee on Customs; and\n(d)\nthe Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government Procurement.\n2.

Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the specialised committees shall normally meet at an appropriate level, alternately in the Union or Singapore, every two years or without undue delay at the request of either Party or the Trade Committee. They shall be co-chaired by representatives of the Parties. The specialised committees shall agree on their meeting schedule and set their agenda.\n4.   The specialised committees shall inform the Trade Committee of their schedule and agenda sufficiently in advance of their meetings. They shall report to the Trade Committee on their activities at each regular meeting of the Trade Committee. The creation or existence of a specialised committee shall not prevent a Party from bringing any matter directly to the Trade Committee.\nARTICLE 16.3\nEvolving WTO Law\nIf any provision of the WTO Agreement that the Parties have incorporated into this Agreement is amended, the Parties shall consult with each other, via the Trade Committee, with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution, where necessary. As a result of such a review, the Parties may, by decision in the Trade Committee, amend this Agreement accordingly.\nARTICLE 16.4\nDecision-making\n1.   The Parties may take decisions in the Trade Committee or in a specialised committee, where provided for in this Agreement. The decisions taken in such a committee shall be binding on the Parties, which shall take the measures necessary to implement those decisions.\n2.   The Trade Committee and specialised committees may make appropriate recommendations, where provided for in this Agreement.\n3.   The Trade Committee and specialised committees shall draw up their decisions and recommendations by agreement between the Parties.\nARTICLE 16.5\nAmendments\n1.   The Parties may agree to amend this Agreement. Amendments to this Agreement shall enter into force after the Parties have exchanged written notifications certifying that they have completed their respective applicable legal requirements and procedures, as set out in the instrument of amendment.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Parties may, in the Trade Committee or a specialised committee, adopt a decision amending this Agreement, where provided for in this Agreement.\nARTICLE 16.6\nTaxation\n1.   This Agreement shall only apply to taxation measures insofar as such application is necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement.\n2.   Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of the Union or any of its Member States, or the rights and obligations of Singapore, under any tax agreement between the Union and Singapore or between any of the Member States of the Union and Singapore. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such agreement, that agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. In the case of a tax agreement between the Union and Singapore or between any of the Member States of the Union and Singapore, the competent authorities under that agreement shall have sole responsibility for determining whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and that agreement.\n3.   Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Party from adopting or maintaining any taxation measure which differentiates between taxpayers based on rational criteria, such as whether taxpayers are in the same situation, in particular with regard to their place of residence or with regard to the place where their capital is invested (79).\n4.   Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the adoption or maintenance of any measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes pursuant to the tax provisions of agreements for the avoidance of double taxation or other tax arrangements or domestic fiscal legislation.\n5.\n(a)\nNothing in this Agreement shall prevent Singapore from adopting or maintaining taxation measures which are needed to protect Singapore's overriding public policy interests arising out of its specific constraints of space.\n(b)\nSingapore will notify the Union immediately upon taking such measures, which will be, without delay, the object of consultations in the Trade Committee, with a view to reaching a mutual understanding.\n(c)\nWhere such measures affect the overall balance of commitments agreed between the Parties in this Agreement, the Parties may, by decision in the Trade Committee, alter the Parties' schedules of specific commitments on account of such measures.\nARTICLE 16.7\nCurrent Account and Capital Movements\n1.   The Parties shall authorise, in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, any payments and transfers in freely convertible currency (80) on the current account of the balance-of-payments between the Parties with regard to the transactions which fall within the scope of this Agreement.\n2.   The Parties shall consult each other with a view to facilitating the movement of capital between them within the scope of this Agreement, in particular the progressive liberalisation of the capital and financial account, with the aim of supporting a stable and secure framework for long term investment.\nARTICLE 16.8\nSovereign Wealth Funds\nEach Party shall encourage its sovereign wealth funds to respect the Generally Accepted Principles and Practices – Santiago Principles.\nARTICLE 16.9\nRestrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments\n1.

The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the application of the restrictive measures referred to in paragraph 1. Any restrictive measures adopted or maintained under this Article shall be non-discriminatory, shall be of a limited duration, and shall not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance-of-payments and external financial difficulties. Such measures shall be in accordance with the conditions established in the WTO Agreement and shall be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, as applicable.\n3.   A Party that maintains or has adopted restrictive measures, or that adopts any changes to such measures, shall promptly notify the other Party thereof.\n4.   Where restrictions are adopted or maintained, consultations shall be held promptly in the Trade Committee.

Where, in exceptional circumstances, a Party faces serious difficulties, or the threat thereof, for the operation of that Party's economic and monetary policy or exchange rate policy, that Party may temporarily impose safeguard measures with regard to capital movements, payments or transfers. Such measures shall be strictly necessary, shall not exceed in any case a period of six months (81), and shall not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination between a Party and a non-Party in like situations.\n2.   The Party adopting the safeguard measures shall inform the other Party forthwith, and, as soon as possible, shall present a time schedule for their removal.\nARTICLE 16.11\nSecurity Exceptions\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed to:\n(a)\nrequire either Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests;\n(b)\nprevent either Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests:\n(i)\nconnected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war materials, and related to traffic in other goods and materials and to economic activities carried out directly or indirectly for the purpose of provisioning a military establishment;\n(ii)\nrelating to the supply of services as carried out directly or indirectly for the purpose of provisioning a military establishment;\n(iii)\nrelating to fissionable or fusionable materials, or to the materials from which they are derived; or\n(iv)\ntaken in time of war or other emergency in international relations, or to protect critical public infrastructure (this relates to communications, power or water infrastructure providing essential goods or services to the general public) from deliberate attempts to disable or disrupt it;\n(c)\nprevent either Party from taking any action for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.\nARTICLE 16.12\nDisclosure of Information\n1.   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to make available confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, would otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, whether public or private.\n2.   Where a Party submits information to the Trade Committee or to specialised committees which is considered as confidential under its laws and regulations, the other Party shall treat that information as confidential, unless the submitting Party agrees otherwise.\nARTICLE 16.13\nEntry into Force\n1.   This Agreement shall be approved by the Parties in accordance with their own procedures.\n2.   This Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following that in which the Parties exchange written notifications certifying that they have completed their respective applicable legal requirements and procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement. The Parties may agree on another date.\n3.

It constitutes a specific agreement giving effect to the trade provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.\n2.   For greater certainty, the Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement requires them to act in a manner inconsistent with their obligations under the WTO Agreement.\nARTICLE 16.19\nFuture Accessions to the Union\n1.   The Union shall notify Singapore without undue delay of any request for accession of a third country to the Union.\n2.   During the negotiations between the Union and a candidate country seeking accession, the Union shall endeavour to:\n(a)\nto the extent possible, provide to Singapore any information that Singapore requests regarding any matter covered by this Agreement; and\n(b)\ntake into account any concerns expressed by Singapore.\n3.   The Union shall inform Singapore as soon as feasible about the outcome of accession negotiations with a candidate country, and shall notify Singapore of the entry into force of any accession to the Union.\n4.

Accordingly, for a juridical person set up in accordance with the laws of Singapore and having only its registered office or central administration in the territory of Singapore, the Union shall only extend the benefits of this Agreement if that juridical person possesses an effective and continuous economic link with the economy of Singapore.\n(7)  Without prejudice to the scope of activities which may be considered as cabotage under the relevant national legislation, national maritime cabotage under this Chapter covers transportation of passengers or goods between a port or point located in a Member State of the Union and another port or point located in the same Member State of the Union, including on its continental shelf, as provided in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter referred to as ‘UNCLOS’), and traffic originating and terminating in the same port or point located in a Member State of the Union.\n(8)  Subparagraph 2(a) includes measures which require a service supplier of the other Party to have an establishment within the meaning of paragraph (d) of Article 8.8 (Definitions) or to be resident in a Party's territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service.\n(9)  This subparagraph does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services.\n(10)  Where the economic activity is not performed directly by a juridical person but through other forms of establishment such as a branch or a representative office, the entrepreneur (i.e. the juridical person) shall, nonetheless, through such establishment be accorded the treatment provided for entrepreneurs under this Agreement. Such treatment shall be extended to the establishment through which the economic activity is performed and need not be extended to any other parts of the entrepreneur located outside the territory where the economic activity is performed.\n(11)  For further clarity, a subsidiary of a juridical person of a Party may also refer to a juridical person which is a subsidiary of another subsidiary of a juridical person of that Party.\n(12)  For greater certainty, processing of nuclear materials includes all the activities contained in the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities, as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, N 4, ISIC REV 3.1, 2002 code 2330.\n(13)  Without prejudice to the scope of activities which may be considered as cabotage under the relevant national legislation, national maritime cabotage under this Chapter covers transportation of passengers or goods between a port or point located in a Member State of the Union and another port or point located in the same Member State of the Union, including on its continental shelf, as provided in the UNCLOS, and traffic originating and terminating in the same port or point located in a Member State of the Union.\n(14)  Subparagraphs 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) do not cover measures taken in order to limit the production of an agricultural product.\n(15)  For greater certainty, measures or limitations relating specifically to key personnel and graduate trainees shall be subject to Article 8.14 (Key Personnel and Graduate Trainees).\n(16)  The obligations in this Article apply also to measures governing the composition of boards of directors of an establishment, such as nationality and residency requirements.\n(17)  The recipient establishment may be required to submit a training programme covering the duration of stay for prior approval, demonstrating that the purpose of the stay is for training. The competent authorities may require that training be linked to the university degree which has been obtained.\n(18)  For greater certainty and without prejudice to paragraph 4 of Article 8.1 (Objective and Scope), the stay in the territory of a Party under these provisions does not entitle the intra-corporate transferee to apply for permanent residency or citizenship in that Party.\n(19)  This Article is without prejudice to the rights and obligations deriving from bilateral visa waiver agreements between Singapore and one of the Member States of the Union.\n(20)  Licensing or authorisation fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service provision.\n(21)  ‘CPC’ means the Central Products Classification as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, No 77, CPC prov, 1991.\n(22)  The term ‘software’ means the sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate. A number of different programmes may be developed for specific applications (application software), and the customer may have a choice of using ready-made programmes off the shelf (packaged software), developing specific programmes for particular requirements (customised software) or using a combination of the two.\n(23)  E.g., W/120.1.A.b. (accounting, auditing and bookkeeping services), W/120.1.A.d. (architectural services), W/120.1.A.h. (medical and dental services), W/120.2.D (audiovisual services), W/120.5. (educational services).\n(24)  See previous footnote.\n(25)  For greater certainty, only measures relating to basic letter services shall be subject to Article 8.22 (Prevention of Anti-Competitive Practices in the Postal Sector).\n(26)  The maintenance of appropriate measures includes the effective enforcement of such measures.\n(27)  For the purposes of this Article and Article 8.30 (Conduct of Major Suppliers), designation of a supplier of public telecommunications networks and services as a major supplier shall be in accordance with the domestic law and procedures of each Party.\n(28)  The maintenance of appropriate measures includes the effective enforcement of such measures.\n(29)  Licensing or authorisation fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service provision.\n(30)  For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘measures’ shall comprise only measures that adversely discriminate based on the nationality or geographic area(s) of origin of the natural or juridical person to which the measure is applied.\n(31)  The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society.\n(32)  Measures that are aimed at ensuring the effective or equitable imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a Party under its taxation system which:\n(a)\napply to non-resident entrepreneurs and service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Party's territory;\n(b)\napply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party's territory;\n(c)\napply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures;\n(d)\napply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of the other Party in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the Party's territory;\n(e)\ndistinguish entrepreneurs and service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other entrepreneurs and service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or\n(f)\ndetermine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Party's tax base.\nTax terms or concepts in subparagraph (f) and in this footnote are determined according to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party taking the measure.\n(33)  For the purposes of paragraphs 10, 11 and 13 of this Article and paragraph 2 of Article 9.11 (Negotiations), ‘another notice used as a notice of intended procurement’ means a notice of planned procurement falling within paragraph 5 of Article 9.6 (Notices) and a notice inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion on a multi-use list falling within paragraph 12 of Article 9.8 (Qualification of Suppliers).\n(34)  In the case of the Union, for the purposes of this Chapter, ‘patents’ include rights derived from supplementary protection certificates.\n(35)  Without prejudice to Article 10.6 (Producers of Phonograms), the Parties recognise that references to these international agreements are subject to the reservations which each Party has formulated in relation thereto.\n(36)  For the Union, the term ‘cinematographic works’ also includes audiovisual works.\n(37)  In the case of the Union, the term of protection expires 70 years after the death of the last person designated as author under its domestic law, which will not in any case be shorter than the minimum duration of protection provided under paragraph 3 of Article 10.5 (Term of Protection).\n(38)  ‘Producer of a phonogram’ means the person or the legal entity, who or which takes the initiative and has the responsibility for the first fixation of the sounds of a performance or other sounds, or the representations of sounds.\n(39)  ‘Public performance’ means, in relation to a phonogram, any mode of aural presentation to the public of sounds or representations of sounds fixed in a phonogram.\n(40)  Singapore shall fully implement the obligations of this Article within two years of the entry into force of this Agreement.\n(41)  For the purposes of this Article, ‘technological measures’ means any technology, device or component that, in the normal course of its operation, is designed to prevent or restrict acts, in respect of works, performances, or phonograms, which are not authorised by authors, performers or producers of phonograms, as provided for by each Party's domestic law. Without prejudice to the scope of copyright or related rights contained in each Party's domestic law, technological measures shall be deemed effective where the use of protected works, performances, or phonograms is controlled by authors, performers or producers of phonograms through the application of a relevant access control or protection process, such as encryption or scrambling, or a copy control mechanism, which achieves the objective of protection.\n(42)  Nothing in this Chapter shall require Singapore to restrict the importation or domestic sale of a device that does not render effective a technological measure which sole purpose is to control market segmentation for legitimate copies of motion pictures, and is not otherwise a violation of its domestic law.\n(43)  In implementing paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, neither Party shall be obligated to require that the design of, or the design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer electronics product, telecommunications product or computing product, provide for a response to any particular technological measure, so long as the product does not otherwise contravene its measures implementing these paragraphs.\n(44)  For the purposes of this Article, ‘rights management information’ means:\n(a)\ninformation that identifies the work, the performance, or the phonogram; the author of the work, the performer of the performance, or the producer of the phonogram; or the owner of any right in the work, performance or phonogram;\n(b)\ninformation about the terms and conditions of use of the work, performance, or phonogram; or\n(c)\nany number or codes that represent the information described in subparagraphs (a) and (b),\nwhen any of these items of information is attached to a copy of a work, performance, or phonogram, or appears in connection with the communication or making available of a work, performance or phonogram to the public.\n(45)  Singapore is a party to the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks, while the Union shall make all reasonable efforts to facilitate accession to the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks.\n(46)  The fair use of descriptive terms includes the use of a sign to indicate the geographic origin of the goods or services, and where such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.\n(47)  For the purposes of this Chapter, ‘geographical indications’ means indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.\n(48)  For the purposes of Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications), in the case of Singapore, the procedure for protection of geographical indications refers to the domestic registration procedure under the system established by Singapore pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications).\n(49)  For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 1 of Article 10.21 (Relationship with Trademarks), the term ‘like good’, in relation to a good for which a geographical indication has been protected in a Party's system as referred to in Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), means a good that would fall within the same category of good in that Party's register as the good for which a geographical indication has been registered.\n(50)  For greater certainty, it is understood that this is assessed on a case-by-case basis. This provision does not apply where evidence is provided that there is no link between the protected geographical indication and the translated term. It is further understood that this provision applies without prejudice to the general rules of Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications).\n(51)  In the case of Singapore, ‘the producers concerned’ refers to the right holders in question.\n(52)  In the case of Singapore, a geographical indication which conflicts with a prior existing trademark is capable of being registered with the consent of the prior existing trademark rights holder. In the case of the Union, such consent is not a prerequisite to the registration of a geographical indication which conflicts with a prior existing trademark.\n(53)  For the purposes of Sub-Section (Designs), the Union also grants protection to the unregistered design when it meets the requirements of Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1891/2006 of 18 December 2006.\n(54)  The Parties agree that when the domestic law of a Party so provides, individual character of designs can also be required. This refers to designs that significantly differ from known designs or combinations of known designs' features. The Union considers designs to have individual character if the overall impression it produces on the informed users differs from the overall impression produced on such a user by any design which has been made available to the public.\n(55)  It is understood that designs are not excluded from protection simply on the basis that they constitute a part of an article or product, provided that they are visible, fulfil the criteria of this paragraph, and:\n(a)\nfulfil any other criteria for design protection; and\n(b)\nare not otherwise excluded from design protection,\nunder the Parties' respective domestic law.\n(56)  Nothing in this Article precludes either Party from providing other specified exclusions from design protection under its domestic law. The Parties understand that such exclusions shall not be extensive.\n(57)  In the case of Singapore, the extent to which, and the conditions under which, such protection is enjoyed include the circumstances under section 74 of Singapore's Copyright Act.\n(58)  For the purposes of this Article and Article 10.33 (Protection of Test Data Submitted to Obtain an Administrative Marketing Approval to put a Pharmaceutical Product on the Market), the term ‘pharmaceutical product’ shall be defined for each Party by the respective legislations of the Parties as at the date of signature of this Agreement. In the case of the Union, the term ‘pharmaceutical product’ refers to ‘medicinal product’.\n(59)  Singapore undertakes to make available an extension of the duration of the rights conferred by patent protection to compensate the patent owner for the reduction in the effective patent life as the result of the administrative marketing approval process to substances for diagnosis or testing and authorised as a medicinal product.\n(60)  The conditions and procedures for the provision of the extension of the patent term shall be determined by the respective legislations of the Parties. This is without prejudice to a possible extension for paediatric purposes, if provided for by either Party.\n(61)  The conditions and procedures for the provision of the protection contemplated under this Article shall be determined by the respective legislations of the Parties.\n(62)  The Parties shall, five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, initiate without prejudice discussions on the possible extension of the duration of the protection of test data submitted to obtain an administrative marketing approval to put a pharmaceutical product on the market.\n(63)  In the context of this Article, it is understood that such confidential supporting test data or studies shall not be used for the purpose of determining whether to grant any other application for a period of at least five years:\n(a)\nin the case of Singapore, from the date that the first application is received;\n(b)\nin the case of the Union, from the date of approval of the first application,\nunless the party which had provided the test data or studies has given his consent.\n(64)  In the case of the Union, for the purposes of this Article, ‘agricultural chemical products’ means active substances and preparations containing one or more active substances, put up in the form in which they are supplied to the user, intended to:\n(a)\nprotect plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or prevent the action of such organisms, in so far as such substances or preparations are not otherwise defined in subparagraphs (b) to (e);\n(b)\ninfluence the life processes of plants, other than as a nutrient (e.g. plant growth regulators);\n(c)\npreserve plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to special Council or Commission provisions on preservatives;\n(d)\ndestroy undesirable plants; or\n(e)\ndestroy parts of plants, check or prevent undesirable growth of plants.\n(65)  In so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law, it is understood that the phrase ‘federations and associations’ includes collective rights management bodies and, in the Union context, professional defence bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights.\n(66)  A Party may exclude patents from the scope of Section C (Civil Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights).\n(67)  It is understood that, in the case of Singapore, Singapore may provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order pecuniary compensation if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, or if execution of the measures in question would cause him disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.\n(68)  In the case of the Union, this would also include, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors such as the moral prejudice caused to the right holder by the infringement.\n(69)  It is understood that the function of transmission includes the function of routing.\n(70)  It is understood that the function of providing access for material without selection and/or modification of the content also refers to any means that is used to access the communication network and includes instances where connections are provided for the material.\n(71)  It is understood that the process of caching carried out through an automatic process may refer to the intermediate and temporary storage of material in the course of transmission or providing access to such material.\n(72)  The Parties will review the possibility of including pirated design goods within the scope of paragraph 2 of this Article within three years of the entry into force of this Agreement. The Parties may, by decision in the Trade Committee, amend paragraph 2 of this Article as a result of such review.\n(73)  Where the competent authority in Singapore assesses that according to the prohibition laid down in section 34 of the Competition Act (Chapter 50B), the anti-competitive effects of a vertical agreement will likely outweigh its pro-competitive effects, the competent authority will refer the matter to the Minister. The Minister shall decide on the applicability of section 34 of the Competition Act to the vertical agreement in question. This is without prejudice to the possibility of the competent authority in Singapore applying section 47 of the Competition Act, which is applicable to vertical agreements concluded by a dominant firm.\n(74)  This paragraph does not prejudice the outcome of future discussions in the WTO on the definition of subsidies for services. The Parties shall give positive consideration to the adoption of a possible decision by the Trade Committee to update this Agreement to reflect the agreement reached at the WTO on the definition of subsidies for services.\n(75)  This does not prevent the Parties from providing temporary liquidity support in the form of loan guarantees or loans limited to the amount needed to merely to keep an ailing undertaking in business for the time necessary to work out a restructuring or liquidation plan.\n(76)  When ‘labour’ is referred to in this Chapter, it includes the issues relevant to the Decent Work Agenda as agreed on in the ILO and in the Ministerial Declaration of the UN Economic and Social Council on Generating Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work for All of 2006.\n(77)  The multilateral environmental agreements referred to shall encompass those protocols, amendments, annexes and adjustments binding on the Parties.\n(78)  For greater certainty, the review of administrative actions can take the form of common law judicial review, and the correction of administrative actions may include a referral back to the body that took such action for corrective action.\n(79)  For greater certainty, the Parties share an understanding that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any taxation measure aimed at social welfare, public health or other socio-community objectives, or at macroeconomic stability; or tax benefits linked to place of incorporation and not the nationality of the person owning the company. Taxation measures aimed at macroeconomic stability are measures in reaction to movements and trends in the national economy to address or to prevent systemic imbalances which seriously threaten the stability of the national economy.\n(80)  ‘Freely convertible currency’ means a currency which is widely traded in international foreign exchange markets and widely used in international transactions.\n(81)  The application of safeguard measures may be extended through their formal reintroduction in case of continuing exceptional circumstances and after having notified the other Party regarding the implementation of any proposed formal reintroduction.\nLIST OF ANNEXES, APPENDICES, JOINT DECLARATIONS, PROTOCOLS AND UNDERSTANDINGS TO THIS AGREEMENT\nAnnexes and Appendices to Chapter Two\nAnnex 2-A\nElimination of Customs Duties\nAppendix 2-A-1\nTariff Schedule of Singapore\nAppendix 2-A-2\nTariff Schedule of the Union\nAttachment to Appendix 2-A-2\nTariff Schedule of the Union – Tariff lines\nAnnex 2-B\nMotor Vehicles and Parts thereof\nAnnex 2-C\nPharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices\nAnnex and Appendices to Chapter Four\nAnnex 4-A\nElectronics\nAppendix 4-A-1\nScope\nAppendix 4-A-2\nProduct Categories\nAppendix 4-A-3\nDefinitions\nAnnexes to Chapter Five\nAnnex 5-A\nCompetent Authorities\nAnnex 5-B\nRequirements and Provisions for Approval of Establishments for Products of Animal Origin\nAnnexes and Appendices to Chapter Eight\nAnnex 8-A\nThe Union's Schedule of Specific Commitments\nAppendix 8-A-1\nUnion - Schedule of Specific Commitments in Conformity with Article 8.7 (Schedule of Specific Commitments)\nAppendix 8-A-2\nUnion - Schedule of Specific Commitments in Conformity with Article 8.12 (Schedule of Specific Commitments)\nAppendix 8-A-3\nUnion - Schedule of Specific Commitments in Conformity with Articles 8.14 (Key Personnel and Graduate Trainees) and 8.15 (Business Services Sellers)\nAnnex 8-B\nSingapore's Schedule of Specific Commitments\nAppendix 8-B-1\nSingapore - Schedule of Specific Commitments\nAppendix 8-B-2\nSingapore - Schedule of Specific Commitments – Appendix on Financial Services\nAnnexes to Chapter Nine\nAnnex 9-A\nCentral Entities which Procure in Accordance with the Provisions of this Agreement\nAnnex 9-B\nSub-central Entities which Procure in Accordance with the Provisions of this Agreement\nAnnex 9-C\nUtilities and other Entities which Procure in Accordance with the Provisions of this Agreement\nAnnex 9-D\nGoods\nAnnex 9-E\nServices\nAnnex 9-F\nConstruction Services and Works Concessions\nAnnex 9-G\nGeneral Notes and Derogations from the Provisions of Article 9.4 (General Principles)\nAnnex 9-H\nMeans of Publication\nAnnex 9-I\nPublic-Private-Partnerships\nAnnexes to Chapter Ten\nAnnex 10-A\nList of Names to be Applied for Protection as Geographical Indications in the Territory of the Parties\nAnnex 10-B\nProtected Geographical Indications\nAnnex to Chapter Eleven\nAnnex 11-A\nPrinciples Applicable to other Subsidies\nAnnexes to Chapter Fourteen\nAnnex 14-A\nRules of Procedure for Arbitration\nAnnex 14-B\nCode of Conduct for Arbitrators and Mediators\nProtocols\nProtocol 1\nConcerning the Definition of the Concept of ‘Originating Products’ and Methods of Administrative Co-operation (includes Annexes and Joint Declarations thereto)\nUnderstandings\nUnderstanding 1\nIn Relation to Article 16.6 (Taxation)\nUnderstanding 2\nIn Relation to the Remuneration of Arbitrators\nUnderstanding 3\nAdditional Customs-Related Provisions\nUnderstanding 4\nMutual Recognition of Authorised Economic Operators (AEO) Programmes\nJoint Declarations\nJoint Declaration\nConcerning Customs Unions\nANNEX 2-A\nELIMINATION OF CUSTOMS DUTIES\n1.\nPursuant to Article 2.6 (Reduction or Elimination of Customs Duties on Imports), each Party shall eliminate all customs duties imposed on goods originating in the other Party as from the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in the respective Party's Schedules included in this Annex.\n2.   \nThe following staging categories apply to the elimination of customs duties by each Party pursuant to Article 2.6 (Reduction or Elimination of Customs Duties on Imports) for those customs duties not eliminated at the entry into force of this Agreement:\n(a)\ncustoms duties on originating goods provided for in the items in staging category ‘3’ in a Party's Schedule shall be removed in four equal annual stages beginning on the date this Agreement enters into force, and such goods shall thereafter be free of any customs duty;\n(b)\ncustoms duties on originating goods provided for in the items in staging category ‘5’ in a Party's Schedule shall be removed in six equal stages beginning on the date this Agreement enters into force, and such goods shall thereafter be free of any customs duty;

To the extent that provisions of this Schedule are identical to the corresponding provisions of the STCCE, the provisions of this Schedule shall have the same meaning as the corresponding provisions of the STCCE.\n2.\nPursuant to Article 2.6 (Reduction or Elimination of Customs Duties on Imports), Singapore shall eliminate customs duties on all originating goods of the Union as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\nANNEX 2-B\nMOTOR VEHICLES AND PARTS THEREOF\nARTICLE 1\nGeneral Provisions\n1.   This Annex shall apply to all forms of motor vehicles and parts thereof that are traded between the Parties that fall under Chapters 40, 84, 85, 87 and 94 of the HS 2012 (hereinafter referred to as ‘products covered by this Annex’).\n2.   With regard to the products covered by this Annex, the Parties confirm the following shared objectives and principles:\n(a)\neliminating and preventing non-tariff barriers to bilateral trade;\n(b)\npromoting compatibility and convergence of regulations based on international standards;\n(c)\npromoting recognition of approvals based, in particular, on approval schemes applied under the agreements administered by the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (hereinafter referred to as the ‘WP.29’) within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (hereinafter referred to as ‘UNECE’);\n(d)\nestablishing competitive market conditions based on the principles of openness, non-discrimination and transparency;\n(e)\nsecuring the protection of human health, safety and the environment; and\n(f)\nenhancing cooperation to foster continued mutually beneficial development in trade.\nARTICLE 2\nInternational Standards\n1.   The Parties recognise that the WP.29 is the relevant international standard-setting body for the products covered by this Annex (1).\n2.   If Singapore decides to introduce a type-approval system for products covered by this Annex, Singapore will consider becoming a signatory of the Agreement concerning the Adoption of Uniform Technical Prescriptions for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts which can be fitted and/or be used on Wheeled Vehicles and the Conditions for Reciprocal Recognition of Approvals Granted on the Basis of these Prescriptions, done at Geneva on 20 March 1958.\nARTICLE 3\nRegulatory Convergence\n1.\n(a)\nThe Parties shall at all times refrain from introducing any new domestic technical regulations that diverge from UNECE Regulations or Global Technical Regulations (hereinafter referred to as ‘GTR’) in areas covered by such UNECE Regulations or GTR, or where the completion of such UNECE Regulations or GTR is imminent, unless there are substantiated reasons, based on scientific or technical information, why a specific UNECE Regulation is ineffective or inappropriate for ensuring road safety or for the protection of the environment or public health (2).\n(b)\nA Party which introduces a new domestic technical regulation as referred to in subparagraph (a), upon request of the other Party, shall identify the parts of the domestic technical regulation which substantially deviate from the relevant UNECE Regulations or GTR, and shall provide due justification as to the reasons for the deviation.\n2.   Insofar as a Party has introduced and maintains domestic technical regulations that diverge from existing UNECE Regulations or GTR in accordance with paragraph 1, that Party shall review those domestic technical regulations at regular intervals not exceeding five years, with a view to increasing the convergence of those domestic technical regulations with the relevant UNECE Regulations or GTR. When reviewing their domestic technical regulations, the Parties shall consider whether the circumstances that gave rise to the divergence still exist. The outcome of these reviews, including scientific and technical information used, shall be notified to the other Party upon request.\n3.   Singapore shall accept new (3) Union products covered by this Annex and which are covered by an EC or UNECE type-approval certificate on its market as complying with its domestic technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, without further testing or marking requirements to verify or attest compliance with requirements covered by an EC (4) or UNECE type-approval. A certificate of conformity, in the case of whole vehicles, or an EC or UNECE type-approval mark affixed to the product, in the case of components and separate technical units, shall be considered sufficient proof of the type-approval certificate.\n4.   The competent administrative authorities of each Party may verify by random sampling in accordance with its domestic legislation that the products comply with, as appropriate:\n(a)\nall the domestic technical regulations of the Party; or\n(b)\nthe domestic technical regulations to which compliance has been attested by an EC Certificate of conformity, in the case of whole vehicles, or an EC or UNECE mark affixed to the product, in the case of components and separate technical units, as referred to in paragraph 3.\nSuch verification shall be carried out in accordance with the domestic technical regulations under subparagraphs (a) or (b), as the case may be. Each Party may require a supplier to withdraw a product from its market where the product concerned does not comply with those regulations and requirements.\nARTICLE 4\nProducts with New Technologies or New Features\n1.   Neither Party shall prevent or unduly delay the placing on its market of a product covered by this Annex and approved by the exporting Party, on the ground that the product incorporates a new technology or a new feature that the importing Party has not yet regulated, unless the importing Party can demonstrate, based on scientific or technical information, that such new technology or new feature creates a risk for human health, safety or the environment.\n2.   When a Party refuses the placing on its market, or requires the withdrawal from its market, of a product of the other Party covered by this Annex on the grounds that it incorporates a new technology or a new feature creating a risk for human health, safety or the environment, it shall immediately notify this decision to the other Party and to the economic operators (5) concerned. The notification shall include all relevant scientific or technical information considered in the Party's decision.\nARTICLE 5\nLicensing\nNeither Party shall apply automatic import licensing or non-automatic import licensing (6) to the products covered by this Annex.\nARTICLE 6\nOther Measures Restricting Trade\nEach Party shall refrain from nullifying or impairing the market access benefits accruing to the other Party under this Annex through other regulatory measures specific to the sector covered by this Annex. This is without prejudice to the right of each Party to adopt measures necessary for road safety, the protection of the environment or public health and the prevention of deceptive practices, provided such measures are based on substantiated scientific or technical information.\nARTICLE 7\nJoint Cooperation\nIn the Committee on Trade in Goods, the Parties shall cooperate and exchange information on any matters relevant for the implementation of this Annex.\n(1)  This paragraph is without prejudice to the Parties' rights to accept national standards or technical regulations of other countries.\n(2)  Paragraphs 1(a) and 2 of Article 3 (Regulatory Convergence) and Article 6 (Other Measures Restricting Trade) of this Annex are without prejudice to Singapore taking traffic management measures such as electronic road pricing, on account of Singapore's specific space constraints.\n(3)  For the purposes of this paragraph, where the term ‘new Union products covered by this Annex’ refers to whole vehicles, this term is understood to mean vehicles which have never been registered before worldwide.\n(4)  For greater clarity, the terms ‘EC type-approval’, ‘EC type-approval certificate’, ‘certificate of conformity’ and ‘EC type-approval mark’ shall have the meanings assigned to them under Union legislation, in particular Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (OJ EU L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1).\n(5)  Where Singapore is the importing Party, ‘economic operator’ shall mean the importer of the product concerned.\n(6)  The terms ‘import licensing’, ‘automatic import licensing’ and ‘non-automatic import licensing’ are defined in Articles 1 to 3 of the WTO Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures.\nANNEX 2-C\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND MEDICAL DEVICES\nARTICLE 1\nGeneral Provisions\nThe Parties confirm the following shared objectives and principles of:\n(a)\npreventing and eliminating non-tariff barriers to bilateral trade;\n(b)\nestablishing competitive market conditions based on principles of openness, non-discrimination and transparency;\n(c)\npromoting innovation relating to safe and effective pharmaceutical products and medical devices, and promoting timely access to such pharmaceutical products and medical devices, through transparent and accountable procedures, without impeding a Party's ability to apply high standards of safety, efficacy and quality; and\n(d)\nenhancing cooperation between their respective health authorities, based on international standards, practices and guidelines within the framework of relevant international organisations such as the World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as ‘WHO’), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (hereinafter referred to as ‘OECD’), the International Conference on Harmonisation (hereinafter referred to as ‘ICH’), the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (hereinafter referred to as ‘PIC/S’) for pharmaceutical products and the Global Harmonization Task Force (hereinafter referred to as ‘GHTF’) for medical devices.\nARTICLE 2\nInternational Standards\nThe Parties shall base their technical regulations on international standards, practices and guidelines for pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including those developed by the WHO, the OECD, the ICH, the PIC/S and the GHTF, unless there are substantiated reasons based on scientific or technical information why such international standards, practices or guidelines would be ineffective or inappropriate for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued.\nARTICLE 3\nTransparency\n1.   With respect to measures of general application relating to pharmaceutical products and medical devices, each Party shall ensure that:\n(a)\nsuch measures are readily available to interested persons and the other Party, in a non-discriminatory manner, via an officially designated medium and, where feasible and possible, via electronic means, in such manner as to enable interested persons and the other Party to become acquainted with them;\n(b)\nan explanation of the objective of and rationale for such measures is provided to the extent possible; and\n(c)\nthere is reasonable time between publication and entry into force of such measures, except where not possible on grounds of urgency.\n2.   In accordance with their respective domestic law, each Party shall, to the extent possible:\n(a)\npublish in advance any proposal to adopt or amend any measure of general application relating to the regulation of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including an explanation of the objective of and rationale for the proposal;\n(b)\nprovide reasonable opportunities for interested persons and the other Party to comment on such proposed measures, allowing, in particular, for sufficient time for such opportunities; and\n(c)\ntake into account the comments received from interested persons and the other Party with respect to such proposed measures.\n3.   To the extent that a Party's health care authorities introduce or operate procedures for the listing, pricing or reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, the Party shall:\n(a)\nensure that the criteria, rules, procedures, and where relevant, any guidelines, that apply to the listing, pricing or reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, are objective, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and are available to interested persons upon request;\n(b)\nensure that decisions on all applications for the pricing of pharmaceutical products, or for the approval of such products for reimbursement, are adopted and communicated to the applicant within a reasonable and specified period, which shall be measured from the date of the receipt of the application; if the information submitted by the applicant is deemed inadequate or insufficient and the procedure is suspended as a result, the Party's competent authorities shall notify the applicant of the additional information that is required and shall resume the original decision-making process upon receipt of this additional information;\n(c)\nprovide applicants with appropriate opportunities to provide comments at relevant points in the decision-making process for pricing and reimbursement decisions, without prejudice to the applicable domestic law on confidentiality;\n(d)\nin case of a negative decision on listing, pricing or reimbursement, provide the applicant with a statement of reasons that is sufficiently detailed for the applicant to understand the basis of the decision, including the criteria applied and, if appropriate, provide any expert opinions or recommendations on which the decision is based; in addition, the applicant shall be informed of any remedies available under domestic law and of the time limits for applying for such remedies.\nARTICLE 4\nRegulatory Cooperation\nThe Committee on Trade in Goods shall:\n(a)\nmonitor and support the implementation of this Annex;\n(b)\nfacilitate cooperation and the exchange of information between the Parties, with a view to furthering the objectives of this Annex;\n(c)\ndiscuss ways to foster the compatibility of regulatory approval processes wherever possible; and\n(d)\ndiscuss ways to facilitate bilateral trade in active pharmaceutical ingredients.\nARTICLE 5\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Annex:\n(a)\n‘pharmaceutical products’ means:\n(i)\nany substance or combination of substances presented for treating or preventing diseases in human beings; or\n(ii)\nany substance or combination of substances which may be administered to human beings with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions in human beings.\nPharmaceutical products include, for example, chemical medicinal products, biological medicinal products (e.g. vaccines, (anti)toxins), including medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma, advanced therapy medicinal products (e.g. gene therapy medicinal products, cell therapy medicinal products), herbal medicinal products, and radiopharmaceuticals;\n(b)\n‘medical device’ (1) means any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, appliance, implant, in vitro reagent or calibrator, software, material, or other similar or related article, intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for one or more of the specific purpose(s) of:\n(i)\nthe diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease;\n(ii)\nthe diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury;\n(iii)\nthe investigation, replacement, modification or support of the anatomy or of a physiological process;\n(iv)\nthe control of conception;\n(v)\nsupporting or sustaining life;\n(vi)\nthe disinfection of medical devices;\n(vii)\nproviding information for medical or diagnostic purposes by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body;\n(c)\n‘a Party's health care authorities’ means entities that are part of or have been established by a Party to operate or administer its health care programmes, unless otherwise specified; and\n(d)\n‘manufacturer’ means the legal right holder of the product in the respective Party's territory.\n(1)  For greater clarity, medical device does not achieve its primary intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but may be assisted in its function by such means.\nANNEX 4-A\nELECTRONICS\nARTICLE 1\nGeneral Provisions\n1.   The Parties confirm the following shared objectives and principles:\n(a)\neliminating and preventing non-tariff barriers to bilateral trade;\n(b)\nbasing their standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, wherever appropriate, on relevant international standards;\n(c)\neliminating duplicative and unnecessarily burdensome conformity assessment procedures; and\n(d)\nenhancing cooperation to foster the development of their bilateral trade in electronics.\n2.   This Annex shall apply only to standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures of either Party that relate to the safety and electromagnetic compatibility (hereinafter referred to as ‘EMC’) of electrical and electronic equipment, electrical household appliances and consumer electronics, as defined in Appendix 4-A-1 (hereinafter referred to as ‘covered products’).\nARTICLE 2\nInternational Standards and Standard-setting Bodies\n1.   The Parties recognise that the International Organization for Standards (hereinafter referred to as ‘ISO’), the International Electrotechnical Commission (hereinafter referred to as ‘IEC’) and the International Telecommunication Union (hereinafter referred to as ‘ITU’) are the relevant international standard-setting bodies for EMC and for the safety of products covered by this Annex (1).\n2.   Where relevant international standards established by ISO, IEC and ITU exist, the Parties shall use such international standards or the relevant parts of such standards as a basis for any standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, except for cases where such international standards or relevant parts would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued by a Party. In such cases, upon the request of a Party, the other Party shall identify the parts of the respective standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure which substantially deviate from the relevant international standard, and shall justify the deviation.\n3.   Without prejudice to Article 2.3 of the TBT Agreement, insofar as a Party maintains technical regulations that deviate from existing relevant international standards as referred to in paragraph 2, that Party shall review such technical regulations at regular intervals, which shall not exceed five years, in order to assess whether the circumstances that gave rise to the deviation from the relevant international standard still exist. The outcome of such reviews shall be communicated to the other Party upon request.\n4.   The Parties shall encourage their standard-setting bodies to participate in the development of international standards in the ISO, IEC and ITU, and to consult within the framework of those international standard-setting bodies, with a view to establishing common approaches.\nARTICLE 3\nInnovation\n1.   No Party shall prevent or unduly delay the placing of a product on its market on the grounds that the product incorporates a new technology or a new feature which has not yet been regulated.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not prejudice the right of the importing Party, where it demonstrates duly substantiated concerns to the supplier of a product referred to in paragraph 1, to require evidence that the new technology or new feature concerned does not create a risk for safety or EMC or for any other legitimate objective as listed in Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement.\nARTICLE 4\nConformity Assessment Procedures\n1.   The Parties shall not prepare, adopt or apply conformity assessment procedures with the purpose or effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade with the other Party. In principle, Parties should avoid requiring mandatory third-party conformity assessments to prove that covered products comply with applicable technical regulations on safety and/or EMC, and instead should consider the use of a supplier's declaration of conformity and/or post-market surveillance mechanisms to ensure that products conform with relevant standards or technical requirements.\n2.   Except as provided in Article 5 (Safeguard Measures), Article 6 (Exceptions) and Appendix 4-A-2, insofar as a Party requires a positive assurance of conformity with domestic technical regulations on the safety and/or EMC of covered products, each Party shall accept products on its market on the basis of one or more of the following:\n(a)\na supplier's declaration of conformity, where intervention by a conformity assessment body or the testing of the product by a recognised test laboratory is not mandatory and, if testing is undertaken, such testing can be carried out by the manufacturer itself or by a competent body of its choice; or\n(b)\na supplier's declaration of conformity that is based on a test report issued by a Certification Body (‘CB’) Testing Laboratory of the other Party under the CB Scheme of the Worldwide System for Conformity Testing and Certification of Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) (hereinafter referred to as ‘IECEE CB Scheme’), and that is accompanied by a valid CB Test Certificate that was issued in accordance with the rules and procedures of the IECEE CB Scheme and with the commitments by the Parties thereunder; or\n(c)\na supplier's declaration of conformity that is based on a test report issued by any testing laboratory or is based on a certificate issued by any certification body in the other Party that has concluded voluntary arrangements for the mutual acceptance of test reports or certificates with one or more conformity assessment bodies designated by the importing Party.\nThe choice of basis under this paragraph shall rest with the supplier.\n3.   The supplier's declaration of conformity referred to in paragraph 2 shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 17050. The Parties shall accept that the supplier is solely responsible for issuing, changing or withdrawing the declaration of conformity, for preparing the technical documentation which shall enable the assessment whether the products concerned conform with the applicable technical regulations, and for affixing any required markings. The Parties may require that the declaration of conformity be dated and identify the supplier or the supplier's authorised representative in their territories, that the person empowered by the manufacturer or his authorised representative sign the declaration, the products covered by the declaration, and the applied technical regulations to which the declaration of conformity relates.\n4.   In addition to paragraphs 1 to 3, no Party shall require any form of registration of products or of suppliers, where such registration could prevent or otherwise delay the placing on the market of products that comply with the Party's technical regulations. Where a Party reviews the supplier's declaration, such review shall be limited solely to verifying, on the basis of the documentation submitted, that the test was done in accordance with the Party's relevant technical regulations, and that the information contained in the documentation is complete. Such reviews shall not cause undue delay for the placing of the products on the Party's market, and the Party shall accept the declaration, without exceptions, if the products comply with the Party's technical regulations and the documentation submitted is complete. In the event that a Party rejects a declaration, that Party shall communicate its decision to the supplier, together with an explanation of the grounds for the rejection. At the request of the supplier, the Party shall provide information or guidance, as appropriate, on how to rectify the shortcomings, as well as an explanation of possibilities for appealing the decision.\nARTICLE 5\nSafeguard Measures\nNotwithstanding Article 4 (Conformity Assessment Procedures), either Party may introduce requirements for mandatory third-party testing or certification of the EMC or safety of covered products, or may introduce administrative procedures for approving or reviewing test reports, for particular covered products under the following conditions:\n(a)\nthere exist compelling reasons related to the protection of human health or safety that justify the introduction of such requirements or procedures, supported by substantiated technical or scientific information;\n(b)\nsuch requirements or procedures are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the Party's legitimate objectives, taking into account the risks that non-fulfilment would create; and\n(c)\nthe Party could not have reasonably foreseen the need for introducing such requirements or procedures at the time of entry into force of this Agreement.\nWithout prejudice to Article 2.10 of the TBT Agreement, before introducing the requirements or procedures, each Party shall notify the other Party and, following consultations, shall take the comments of the other Party into account to the greatest extent possible in devising such requirements or procedures. Any requirements that are introduced shall comply with this Annex to the greatest extent possible. Once adopted, any requirement or procedure that is introduced shall be regularly reviewed, and shall be repealed if the reasons for introducing that requirement or procedure no longer exist.\nARTICLE 6\nExceptions\n1.   Pursuant to Singapore's agreement to substantially reduce the list of products for which it requires a positive assurance of conformity with its mandatory safety and/or EMC requirements, in the form of third-party certification, at the time of entry into force of this Agreement, Singapore shall only require such third-party certification for the product categories listed in Appendix 4-A-2.\n2.   By the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Singapore shall have undertaken a review of its Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme with a view to reducing the number of products categories that are covered by the scheme and listed in Appendix 4-A-2. Such review shall examine the necessity of maintaining that scheme in its existing form, or whether that scheme's desired outcomes of ensuring human health and safety in Singapore can be achieved with simplified procedures that better facilitate trade (2).\n3.   The review referred to in paragraph 2 shall include a risk assessment for each of the products covered by the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme to ascertain whether moving towards post-market surveillance in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 4 (Conformity Assessment Procedures) or accepting a positive assurance of conformity in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 4 (Conformity Assessment Procedures) would create unreasonable risks for human health and safety. The risk assessment shall be conducted on the basis of available scientific and technical information, such as consumer reports on safety accidents and the non-conformity rate of product inspection. The risk assessment shall also consider whether the products had been used for their intended end-uses and whether those products had been used with reasonable and usual care.\n4.   Depending on the outcome of the review referred to in paragraph 3, Singapore may maintain its requirements for the positive assurance of conformity by means of third-party certification for those products that are covered by the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme, and are listed in Appendix 4-A-2, where the results of the risk assessment referred to in paragraph 3 demonstrate that adopting the procedures in paragraph 2 of Article 4 (Conformity Assessment Procedures) for such products would create unreasonable risks for human health and safety, or where it would not be possible to set up the post-market surveillance system to address such risks effectively.\n5.   Singapore shall table the risk assessment referred to in paragraph 3 for discussion at the first meeting of the Committee on Trade in Goods. Following the review carried out by Singapore, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Trade and Goods may modify Appendix 4-A-2 as appropriate.\n6.   Insofar as Singapore continues to require positive assurances of conformity with its mandatory safety and/or EMC requirements in the form of third-party certification for covered products, Singapore shall accept certificates of conformity with its technical regulations that have been issued by a conformity assessment body in the Union that was designated by Singapore (3). Singapore shall also ensure that, for the purposes of issuing such certification, the conformity assessment bodies designated by Singapore accept test reports issued:\n(a)\nin accordance with the rules and procedures of the IECEE CB Scheme, and in accordance with the commitments of the Parties thereunder, by one of the Recognised CB Testing Laboratories or Recognised CB Manufacturer's Testing Laboratories of the Union;\n(b)\nin accordance with relevant international standards, guides and recommendations (including ISO/IEC 17025), by any testing laboratory of the Union that has been accredited by an accreditation body which is a signatory to the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation or one of its regional bodies' mutual recognition agreements to which Singapore is a Party; or\n(c)\nby any testing laboratory in the Union that has concluded voluntary arrangements for mutual acceptance of test reports with one or more conformity assessment bodies designated by Singapore.\n7.   Five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, and thereafter at regular intervals that shall not exceed five years, Singapore shall review Appendix 4-A-2 again, with the aim of reducing the number of product categories listed therein. Such reviews shall include the risk assessments laid out in paragraph 3. Singapore shall submit such risk assessments for discussion at the Committee on Trade in Goods.\n8.

For lawyers providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures may take, inter alia, the form of compliance with local codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance requirements, simple registration with the host country Bar or a simplified admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional domicile in the host country. Legal services in respect of Union law shall be carried out in principle by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in a Member State of the Union acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State of the Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the Union might therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the Union since it involves practice of Union and national procedural law. However, in some Member States, foreign lawyers not fully admitted to the Bar are allowed to represent a party in civil proceedings where that party is a national of or belonging to the State in which the lawyer is entitled to practice.\n(7)  Does not include legal advisory and legal representational services on tax matters, which are to be found under 1.A.(a) Legal Services.\n(8)  The supply of pharmaceuticals to the general public, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing and qualification requirements and procedures applicable in the Member States of the Union.

Provision of legal services is only authorised in respect of public international law, Union law and the law of any jurisdiction where the service supplier or its personnel is qualified to practice as a lawyer, and, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing requirements and procedures applicable in the Member States of the Union. For lawyers providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures may take, inter alia, the form of compliance with local codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance requirements, simple registration with the host country Bar or a simplified admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional domicile in the host country.

Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the Union might therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the Union since it involves practice of Union and national procedural law.

The Parties will, with a view to granting further market access, review their commitments in legal services no later than two years after entry into force of the EUSFTA. The Trade Committee may amend either Party’s schedules in this respect.\n(4)  A ‘letter’ means any communication in written form on any kind of physical medium to be conveyed and delivered (otherwise than electronically) to a particular addressee or address indicated by the sender on the letter itself or on its wrapping, and includes a postal article containing such communication, but does not include any book, catalogue, newspaper or periodical.\n(5)  The security conditions cannot in any case constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the EU operators, or a disguised restriction on establishment or cross border supply of services.\n(6)  A ‘local express letter’ means a letter originating from a sender in Singapore and intended for delivery within Singapore within the same working day.\n(7)  An ‘international express letter’ means a letter – (i) originating from a sender in Singapore and intended for delivery to a destination outside Singapore at a rate faster than the published delivery standard for air mail letters despatched by the public postal licensee; or (ii) originating from a sender outside Singapore and intended for delivery within the same working day in Singapore.\n(8)  Telecommunication services exclude broadcasting services, which are services consisting of the uninterrupted chains of transmission by wired or wireless means required for the reception and/or display of aural and/or visual programme signals by all or part of the public.\n(9)  Basic Telecommunication Services may be provided using satellite technology.\n(10)  This includes voice, data and facsimile services.\n(11)  Mobile Services may be provided using satellite technology.\n(12)  Local tertiary institutions are tertiary institutions which are established pursuant to an Act of Parliament, or as designated by the Ministry of Education.\n(13)  For example, partnerships and sole proprietorships are generally not acceptable juridical forms for depository financial institutions in Singapore.

Young offenders are detained in an ‘approved school’ for rehabilitation rather than for formal education.\nAppendix 8-B-2\nSINGAPORE\nSCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS – APPENDIX ON FINANCIAL SERVICES\nA.   SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS\nAll the commitments in this Schedule are subject to horizontal commitments in Singapore's Schedule of Specific Commitments. All the commitments in this Schedule are also subject to entry requirements, admission criteria, domestic laws, guidelines, rules and regulations, terms and conditions of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) or any other relevant authority or body in Singapore, as the case may be provided that they do not circumvent Singapore's obligations taken herewith. Juridical persons supplying financial services are subject to non-discriminatory limitations on juridical form (1).\nRelated to Insurance\n1.\nSingapore shall not require product filing or approval for insurance products other than for life insurance products (2), Central Provident Fund-related products and investment-linked products. Where product filing or approval is required, Singapore shall allow the introduction of the product, which Singapore shall deem to be approved unless the product is disapproved within a reasonable time, endeavouring to do so in 30 days. Singapore shall not maintain limitations on the number or frequency of product introduction. This specific commitment does not apply where a financial institution of the Union seeks to supply a new financial service pursuant to Article 8.53 (New Financial Services).\nRelated to Portfolio Management\n2.\n(a)\nSingapore shall allow, in a manner consistent with Article 8.49 (Scope and Definitions), a financial service supplier other than a trust company or insurance company, organised outside its territory to provide investment advice and portfolio management services, excluding (1) custodial services and (2) trustee services and (3) execution services that are not related to managing a collective investment scheme, to the manager of a collective investment scheme, where the manager is:\n(i)\nlocated in the territory of Singapore; and\n(ii)\nrelated to the financial service supplier.\n(b)\nFor purposes of this paragraph,\n(i)\n‘collective investment scheme’ has the meaning given to it under Section 2 of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289); and\n(ii)\n‘related’ means a related corporation as defined under Section 6 of the Companies Act (Cap. 50).\nRelated to Credit and Charge Cards\n3.\nSingapore shall consider applications for access to automated teller machine networks operated by local banks in Singapore for credit and charge cards of non-bank issuers that are controlled by persons of the Union. Where such applications are approved, non-bank issuers will thereafter be permitted to negotiate for access to the automated teller machine networks operated by local banks on commercial terms.\nB.   OTHERS\n1.\n(a)\nSolely in the context of future liberalisation of its banking subsector, and not for the purposes of affording protection to local financial service suppliers within the banking subsector, Singapore may impose new non-conforming measures on a most-favoured nation treatment basis. Such measures may include, but are not limited to:\n(i)\nrequirements regarding the composition of boards of directors of banks and finance companies; and\n(ii)\nlimitations on the number of customer service locations of finance companies,\nprovided that any such non-conforming measure shall not derogate from commitments undertaken by Singapore in the Financial Services Section of its Schedule of Specific Commitments to liberalise on quantitative restrictions on the number of licences or on customer service locations for Union banks or establish time periods for allowing Union banks access to any ATM network in Singapore.\n(b)\nWhere a Union financial service supplier chooses not to participate in a future liberalisation described in subparagraph (a), Singapore shall not apply any related new non-conforming measure or take any adverse action with respect to the financial service supplier.\n(c)\nIf Singapore imposes any new non-conforming measure described in paragraph (a), it will:\n(i)\nnotify the Union of its intent at least three months in advance of implementation of the measure;\n(ii)\nconsult with the Union concerning the measure and give due consideration to the views expressed by the Union in this respect; and\n(iii)\nmake compensatory adjustments to the Financial Services Section of its Schedule of Specific Commitments with respect to the same class of financial service supplier of the banking subsector as are affected by the measure, such that the general level of commitments is more favourable to trade in the banking subsector than prior to the new measure (3).\n(d)\nSubparagraph (a) shall not apply to any commitments that Singapore makes in respect of additional licences and customer service locations.\n(1)  For example, partnerships and sole proprietorships are generally not acceptable juridical forms for depository financial institutions in Singapore. This headnote is not itself intended to affect, or otherwise limit, a choice by a financial service supplier of the other Party between branches or subsidiaries.\n(2)  Life insurance products here would include non-short term accident and health policies and term policies exceeding five years.\n(3)  It is understood that compensatory adjustments shall not be regarded as inadequate solely because the general level of commitments after the introduction of the new measure is not significantly more favourable to trade in the banking subsector than prior to the introduction of the measure.\nANNEX 9-A\nCENTRAL ENTITIES WHICH PROCURE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT\nPART 1\nSINGAPORE'S COMMITMENTS\nGoods (specified in Annex 9-D)\nThreshold: SDR 50 000\nServices (specified in Annex 9-E)\nThreshold: SDR 50 000\nConstruction (specified in Annex 9-F)\nThreshold: SDR 5 000 000\nList of Entities:\nAuditor-General's Office\nAttorney-General's Chambers\nCabinet Office\nIstana\nJudicature\nMinistry of Transport\nMinistry of Culture, Community and Youth\nMinistry of Education\nMinistry of Environment and Water Resources\nMinistry of Finance\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nMinistry of Health\nMinistry of Home Affairs\nMinistry of Communications and Information\nMinistry of Manpower\nMinistry of Law\nMinistry of National Development\nMinistry of Social and Family Development\nMinistry of Trade and Industry\nParliament\nPresidential Councils\nPrime Minister's Office\nPublic Service Commission\nMinistry of Defence\nThis Agreement applies to purchases by the Singapore Ministry of Defence of the following FSC categories (others being excluded) subject to the Government of Singapore's determinations under the provision of paragraph 1 of Article 9.3 (Security and General Exceptions).\nFSC\nDescription\n22\nRailway Equipment\n23\nGround Effect Vehicles, Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Cycles\n24\nTractors\n25\nVehicular Equipment Components\n26\nTires and Tubes\n29\nEngine Accessories\n30\nMechanical Power Transmission Equipment\n31\nBearings\n32\nWoodworking Machinery and Equipment\n34\nMetalworking Machinery\n35\nService and Trade Equipment\n36\nSpecial Industry Machinery\n37\nAgricultural Machinery and Equipment\n38\nConstruction, Mining, Excavating and Highway Maintenance Equipment\n39\nMaterials Handling Equipment\n40\nRope, Cable, Chain and Fittings\n41\nRefrigeration, Air Conditioning and Air Circulating Equipment\n42\nFire Fighting, Rescue and Safety Equipment\n43\nPumps and Compressors\n44\nFurnace, Steam Plant and Drying Equipment\n45\nPlumbing, Heating and Sanitation Equipment\n46\nWater Purification and Sewage Treatment Equipment\n47\nPipe, Tubing, Hose and Fittings\n48\nValves\n51\nHandtools\n52\nMeasuring Tools\n53\nHardware and Abrasives\n54\nPrefabricated Structures and Scaffolding\n55\nLumber, Millwork, Plywood and Veneer\n56\nConstruction and Building Materials\n61\nElectric Wire, and Power and Distribution Equipment\n62\nLighting, Fixtures and Lamps\n63\nAlarm, Signal and Security Detection Systems\n65\nMedical, Dental and Veterinary Equipment and Supplies\n67\nPhotographic Equipment\n68\nChemicals and Chemical Products\n69\nTraining Aids and Devices\n70\nGeneral Purpose Automatic Data Processing Equipment, Software, Supplies and Support Equipment\n71\nFurniture\n72\nHousehold and Commercial Furnishings and Appliances\n73\nFood Preparation and Serving Equipment\n74\nOffice Machines, Text Processing Systems and Visible Record Equipment\n75\nOffice Supplies and Devices\n76\nBooks, Maps and other Publications\n77\nMusical Instruments, Phonographs and Home-Type Radios\n78\nRecreational and Athletic Equipment\n79\nCleaning Equipment and Supplies\n80\nBrushes, Paints, Sealers and Adhesives\n81\nContainers, Packaging and Packing Supplies\n83\nTextiles, Leather, Furs, Apparel and Shoe Findings, Tents and Flags\n84\nClothing, Individual Equipment, and Insignia\n85\nToiletries\n87\nAgricultural Supplies\n88\nLive Animals\n89\nSubsistence\n91\nFuels, Lubricants, Oils and Waxes\n93\nNon-metallic Fabricated Materials\n94\nNon-metallic Crude Materials\n95\nMetal Bars, Sheets and Shapes\n96\nOres, Minerals, and their Primary Products\n99\nMiscellaneous\nNotes to Part 1 of Annex 9-A:\n1.\nThe Agreement does not apply to any procurement in respect of:\n(a)\nconstruction contracts for chanceries abroad and headquarters buildings entered into by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs;

European Union\n2.   \nFor Singapore:\n(a)\nFor paragraph 2(a) of Article 9.5 (Information on the Procurement System):\nThe Republic of Singapore Government Gazette\n(b)\nFor paragraph 2(b) of Article 9.5 (Information on the Procurement System):\nThe Government Electronic Business portal (GeBIZ)\nhttp://www.gebiz.gov.sg/\nANNEX 9-I\nPUBLIC-PRIVATE-PARTNERSHIPS\n1.\nThe Parties share the understanding that a public-private-partnership (hereinafter referred to as ‘PPP’) refers to a contractual arrangement between a procuring entity and a supplier to deliver a set of services, in which the supplier is granted a major role, in particular in that the risks generally borne by the public sector (such as operative or financial risk) are partially or fully transferred to the supplier.\nPossible Types of PPP Arrangements\n2.\nFor the purpose of Chapter Nine (Government Procurement) and this Annex, PPP in particular include but are not limited to the following types of arrangements:\n(a)\nbuild-operate-transfer: any contractual arrangement the purpose of which is to provide for the construction or rehabilitation of physical infrastructures, buildings, facilities or other government-owned works and under which, as consideration for a supplier's execution of a contractual arrangement, a procuring entity grants to the supplier, for a specified period of time, temporary ownership or a right to control and operate, and demand payment for, the use of such works for the duration of the contract;\n(b)\nbuild-rent-own-transfer/build-lease-operate contracts: where a private operator may rent or lease the asset after the transfer to the procuring entity;\n(c)\ndesign-finance-build-operate contracts: where a private operator designs, builds, develops, operates and manages an asset, without a requirement to transfer the asset at the end of contract; or\n(d)\nlease-develop-operate contracts: where a private operator leases an existing asset, possibly expands or restores it, and operates it.\nTreatment of PPP under the Union's and Singapore's Respective Legal Frameworks\n3.\nFor the purposes of Chapter Nine (Government Procurement) and this Annex:\n(a)\nfor the Union, PPP falls into the two categories of either public works / public services contracts or public works / public services concessions, as prescribed in the Union's relevant legislation governing public procurement;\n(b)\nfor Singapore, PPP is governed by the provisions of the Government Procurement Act and its subsidiary legislation, provided they meet the criteria set out therein.\nCoverage of PPP and Rules Applicable to PPP\n4.\nPPP is covered under Chapter Nine (Government Procurement) subject to Article 9.2 (Scope and Coverage).\n5.\nThe commitments under Chapter Nine (Government Procurement) only apply to the PPP contract concluded between a covered procuring entity and a supplier to which the PPP contract is awarded. Chapter Nine (Government Procurement) does not govern:\n(a)\nthe internal arrangement of the supplier where the supplier is a group of persons providing or seeking to provide services; or\n(b)\nthe acquisition of goods, construction services or other services or any combination of the aforesaid by the supplier to which the PPP contract is awarded.\nANNEX 10-A\nLIST OF NAMES TO BE APPLIED FOR

1\nSECTION 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nARTICLE 1\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Protocol:\n(a)\n‘ASEAN country’ means a member state of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations which is not a Party to this Agreement;\n(b)\n‘chapters’ and ‘headings’ and ‘subheadings’ mean the chapters, the headings and sub-headings used in the nomenclature which makes up the Harmonized System with the changes pursuant to the Recommendation of 26 June 2004 of the Customs Cooperation Council;\n(c)\n‘classified’ refers to the classification of a product or material under a particular chapter, heading, or sub-heading of the Harmonized System;\n(d)\n‘consignment’ means products which are either sent simultaneously from one exporter to one consignee or covered by a single transport document covering their shipment from the exporter to the consignee or, in the absence of such a document, by a single invoice;\n(e)\n‘customs value’ means the value as determined in accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement;\n(f)\n‘ex-works price’ means the price paid for the product ex-works to the manufacturer in whose undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided that the price includes the value of all the materials used and all other costs related to its production, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported.\nWhere the actual price paid does not reflect all costs related to the manufacturing of the product which are actually incurred in the Union or in Singapore, the ex-works price means the sum of all those costs, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported;\n(g)\n‘fungible materials’ means materials that are of the same kind and commercial quality, with the same technical and physical characteristics, and which cannot be distinguished from one another once they are incorporated into the finished product;\n(h)\n‘goods’ means both materials and products;\n(i)\n‘manufacture’ means any kind of working or processing including assembly;\n(j)\n‘material’ means any ingredient, raw material, component or part, etc., used in the manufacture of the product;\n(k)\n‘product’ means the product being manufactured, even if it is intended for later use in another manufacturing operation; and\n(l)\n‘value of materials’ means the customs value at the time of importation of the non-originating materials used, or, if this is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the materials in the Union or in Singapore.\n2.   For the purposes of subparagraph 1(f), where the last working or processing has been subcontracted to a manufacturer, the term ‘manufacturer’ may refer to the enterprise that has employed the subcontractor.\nSECTION 2\nDEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF ‘ORIGINATING PRODUCTS’\nARTICLE 2\nGeneral Requirements\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in a Party:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4; and\n(b)\nproducts obtained in a Party incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Party concerned within the meaning of Article 5.\nARTICLE 3\nCumulation of Origin\n1.   Notwithstanding Article 2 (General Requirements), products shall be considered as originating in a Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials originating in the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). It shall not be necessary that the materials of the other Party have undergone sufficient working or processing.\n2.   Materials originating in an ASEAN country which is applying with the Union a preferential agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the GATT 1994, shall be considered as materials originating in a Party when incorporated in a product obtained in that Party, provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to the rules of origin applicable in the framework of the Union's preferential agreements with those countries.\n4.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the originating status of materials exported from one of the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of origin under which these materials could be exported directly to the Union.\n5.   The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 2 to 7 may only be applied provided that:\n(a)\nthe ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to:\n(i)\ncomply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and\n(ii)\nprovide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol both with regard to the Union and among themselves;\n(b)\nthe undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the Union.\n6.   Origin declarations issued by application of paragraph 4 shall bear one of the following entries:\n(a)\n‘Application of Article 3(2) of Protocol 1 of the EU/Singapore FTA’; or\n(b)\n‘Application du paragraphe 2 de l'article 3 du protocole no 1 de l'ALE UE/Singapour’.\n7.   The materials listed in Annex C to this Protocol shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in paragraphs 2 to 6 where at the time of importation of the product:\n(a)\nthe tariff preference applicable to the materials in a Party is not the same for all the countries involved in the cumulation; and\n(b)\nthe materials concerned would benefit, through cumulation, from a tariff treatment more favourable than the one they would benefit from if directly exported to a Party.\n8.   At the request of a Party, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may modify Annex C to this Protocol. Any request for such a modification shall be communicated to the other Party at least two months before the meeting of that Committee.\n9.   Materials originating in an ASEAN country shall be considered as materials originating in a Party when further processed or incorporated into one of the products listed in Annex D to this Protocol obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).\n10.   For the purposes of paragraph 9, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to the preferential rules of origin applicable to General System of Preferences (hereinafter referred to as ‘GSP’) beneficiary countries which are laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 (1).\n11.   For the purposes of paragraph 9, the originating status of materials exported from one of the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of origin in accordance with the preferential rules applicable to GSP beneficiary countries as laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446.\n12.   The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 9 to 13 may only be applied on the condition that:\n(a)\nthe ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to:\n(i)\ncomply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and\n(ii)\nprovide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol both with regard to the Union and between themselves;\n(b)\nthe undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the Union.\n13.   Origin declarations issued by application of paragraph 9 shall bear one of the following entries:\n(a)\n‘Application of Article 3(9) of Protocol 1 of the EU/Singapore FTA’; or\n(b)\n‘Application du paragraphe 9 de l'article 3 du protocole no 1 de l'ALE UE/Singapour’.\n14.   At the request of a Party, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may modify Annex D to this Protocol. Any request for such a modification shall be communicated to the other Party at least two months before the meeting of the Committee.\n15.   The cumulation provided for in paragraph 9 to 13 shall cease to apply when conditions of paragraphs 2 to 7 are met.\nARTICLE 4\nWholly Obtained Products\n1.   The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in a Party:\n(a)\nmineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;\n(b)\nplants and vegetable products grown or harvested there;\n(c)\nlive animals born and raised there;\n(d)\nproducts from live animals raised there;\n(e)\nproducts from slaughtered animals born and raised there;\n(f)\nproducts obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;\n(g)\nproducts of aquaculture from fish, crustaceans and molluscs that are born and raised there;\n(h)\nproducts of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial seas of a Party by their vessels;\n(i)\nproducts made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (h);\n(j)\nused articles collected there that are fit only for the recovery of raw materials;\n(k)\nwaste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n(l)\nproducts extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside the territorial seas of a Party, provided that the Party has sole rights to work that soil or subsoil; and\n(m)\ngoods produced there exclusively from products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (l).\n2.   The terms ‘their vessels’ and ‘their factory ships’ in subparagraphs 1(h) and 1(i) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:\n(a)\nwhich are registered in a Member State of the Union or in Singapore;\n(b)\nwhich sail under the flag of a Member State of the Union or of Singapore; and\n(c)\nwhich meet one of the following conditions:\n(i)\nthey are at least fifty percent owned by nationals of a Member State of the Union or of Singapore;\nor\n(ii)\nthey are owned by companies:\n(1)\nwhich have their head office and their main place of business in a Member State of the Union or in Singapore, and\n(2)\nwhich are at least fifty percent owned by a Member State of the Union or by Singapore, by public entities or nationals of a Party.\nARTICLE 5\nSufficiently Worked or Processed Products\n1.   For the purposes of subparagraph (b) of Article 2 (General Requirements), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol are fulfilled.\n2.   The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing, and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to the product that acquired originating status, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:\n(a)\nten percent of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of the Harmonized System, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;\n(b)\nten percent of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex A to this Protocol, shall apply.\n4.   Paragraph 3 shall not be construed to allow any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the list in Annex B to this Protocol to be exceeded.\n5.   Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). However, without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification) the tolerance provided for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule for that product laid down in the list in Annex B to this Protocol requires that such materials be wholly obtained.\nARTICLE 6\nInsufficient Working or Processing\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) are satisfied:\n(a)\npreserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;\n(b)\nthe breaking-up and assembly of packages;\n(c)\nthe washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;\n(d)\nthe ironing or pressing of textiles and textile articles;\n(e)\nsimple painting and polishing operations;\n(f)\nthe husking and partial or total milling of rice; the polishing and glazing of cereals and rice;\n(g)\noperations to colour or flavour sugar or form sugar lumps; the partial or total milling of crystal sugar;\n(h)\nthe peeling, stoning and shelling of fruits, nuts and vegetables;\n(i)\nsharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;\n(j)\nsifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles);\n(k)\nsimple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;\n(l)\nthe affixing or printing of marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n(m)\nthe simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any material;\n(n)\nthe simple addition of water to or the dilution, dehydration or denaturation of products;\n(o)\nthe simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or the disassembly of products into parts;\n(p)\na combination of two or more of the operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (o); or\n(q)\nthe slaughter of animals.\n2.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, operations shall be considered simple when no special skills or machines, apparatus or tools that were especially produced or installed for those operations are required for their performance.\n3.   All operations on a given product carried out either in the Union or in Singapore shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.\nARTICLE 7\nUnit of Qualification\n1.   The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.\n2.   When a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each individual item shall be taken into account when applying the provisions of this Protocol.\nWhere, under General Interpretative Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, the packaging shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.\nARTICLE 8\nAccessories, Spare Parts and Tools\nAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.\nARTICLE 9\nSets\nSets, as defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed fifteen percent of the ex-works price of the set.\nARTICLE 10\nNeutral Elements\nIn order to determine whether a product originates in a Party, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following elements which might be used in its manufacture:\n(a)\nenergy and fuel;\n(b)\nplant and equipment, including goods to be used for their maintenance;\n(c)\nmachines and tools and dies and moulds; spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings; lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies; equipment, devices and supplies used for testing or inspecting the good; catalysts and solvents; and\n(d)\nother goods which do not enter, and which are not intended to enter, into the final composition of the product.\nARTICLE 11\nAccounting Segregation\n1.   If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or processing of a product, the competent governmental authorities, at the written request of economic operators, may authorise the management of materials using the accounting segregation method without keeping the materials in separate stocks.\n2.   The competent governmental authorities may make the granting of the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions they deem appropriate.\n3.   The authorisation shall be granted only if it can be ensured by use of the accounting segregation method that, at any given time, the number of products obtained which could be considered as originating in the Union or in Singapore is the same as the number that would have been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks.\n4.   If authorised, the accounting segregation method, for example, averaging, last-in, first-out, or first-in, first-out, shall be applied and the method used shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the Union or in Singapore, depending on where the product is manufactured.\n5.   A manufacturer using the accounting segregation method shall make out or apply for origin declarations for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the exporting Party. At the request of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting Party, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.\n6.   The competent governmental authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisations referred to in paragraph 3 and may withdraw them if a manufacturer makes improper use of the authorisation or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.\nSECTION 3\nTERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS\nARTICLE 12\nPrinciple of Territoriality\n1.   The conditions set out in Section 2 relating to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in a Party.\n2.   If originating goods exported from a Party to a non-Party return, they must be considered as non-originating goods, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nthe returning goods are the same as those exported; and\n(b)\nthey have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that non-Party or while being exported.\nARTICLE 13\nNon Alteration\n1.   The products declared for importation in a Party shall be the same products as exported from the other Party in which they are considered to originate. They shall not have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than operations to preserve them in good condition or other than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any other documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing Party, prior to being declared for import.\n2.   The storage of products or consignments may take place, provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.\n3.   Without prejudice to Section 5, the splitting of consignments may take place where carried out by the exporter or under his responsibility provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.\n4.   Compliance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be considered as satisfied unless the customs authorities have reason to believe the contrary; in such cases, the customs authorities may request the declarant to provide evidence of compliance, which may be given by any means, including contractual transport documents such as bills of lading or factual or concrete evidence based on marking or numbering of packages or any evidence related to the goods themselves.\nARTICLE 14\nExhibitions\n1.   Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than a Party and sold after the exhibition for importation in a Party shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nan exporter has consigned these products from a Party to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;\n(b)\nthe products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in a Party;\n(c)\nthe products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and\n(d)\nthe products have not been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition since they were consigned for exhibition.\n2.   An origin declaration shall be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, during which the products remain under customs control.\nSECTION 4\nDRAWBACK OR EXEMPTION\nARTICLE 15\nProhibition of Drawback of, or Exemption from, Customs Duties\n1.   Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the Union or in Singapore, for which an origin declaration has been issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Section 5, shall not be subject in the Union or in Singapore to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.\n2.   The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, whether partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the Union or in Singapore to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, whether expressly or in effect, where the products obtained from such materials are exported, but not where they are retained in a Party for home use.\n3.   The exporter of products covered by an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents to prove that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.\n4.   The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 8 (Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools), and products in a set within the meaning of Article 9 (Sets), when such items are non-originating.\n5.   The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are subject to this Protocol.\nSECTION 5\nORIGIN DECLARATION\nARTICLE 16\nGeneral Requirements\n1.   Products originating in the Union, on importation into Singapore, and products originating in Singapore, on importation into the Union, shall benefit from preferential tariff treatment of this Agreement upon submission of a declaration, (hereinafter referred to as ‘origin declaration’). The origin declaration is to be provided on an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the originating product in sufficient detail to enable its identification.\n2.   Originating products within the meaning of this Protocol, in the cases specified in Article 22 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration), shall benefit from preferential tariff treatment of this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to in paragraph 1.\nARTICLE 17\nConditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration\n1.   An origin declaration as referred to in Article 16 (General Requirements) may be made out:\n(a)\nin the Union:\n(i)\nby an exporter within the meaning of Article 18 (Approved Exporter); or\n(ii)\nby an exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed 6 000 euro.\n(b)\nin Singapore by an exporter who is:\n(i)\nregistered with the competent authority and who has received a Unique Entity Number; and\n(ii)\ncomplying with relevant regulatory provisions in Singapore pertaining to making out of origin declarations.\n2.   An origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Union or in Singapore and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n3.   The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared at all times to submit, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents as referred to under Article 23 (Supporting Documents) proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n4.   An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex E to this Protocol, in accordance with the domestic law of the exporting Party. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in capital characters. In the case of exports from Singapore, the origin declaration shall be set out using the English version, and in the case of exports from Union, the origin declaration may be set out in one of the linguistic versions, in Annex E to this Protocol.\n5.   Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. An approved exporter as referred to in Article 18 (Approved Exporter) shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.\n6.   By derogation from paragraph 1, an origin declaration may exceptionally be made out after exportation (‘retrospective statement’) on condition that it is presented in the importing Party no later than two years, in the case of the Union, and one year, in the case of Singapore, after the entry of the goods into the territory.\nARTICLE 18\nApproved Exporter\n1.   The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union may authorise any exporter who exports products under this Agreement to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned (hereinafter referred to as ‘approved exporter’). An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.\n3.   The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.\n4.   The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.\n5.   The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.\nARTICLE 19\nValidity of Origin Declaration\n1.   An origin declaration shall be valid for twelve months from the date of issue in the exporting Party. Preferential tariff treatment shall be claimed within such period to the customs authorities of the importing Party.\n2.   Origin declarations which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purposes of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.\n3.   In cases of belated presentation other than those of paragraph 2, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the origin declarations where the products have been submitted before such final date.\nARTICLE 20\nSubmission of Origin Declaration\nFor the purposes of claiming preferential tariff treatment, origin declarations shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that Party. Such authorities may require a translation of an origin declaration.\nARTICLE 21\nImportation in Instalments\nWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonized System are imported in instalments, a single origin declaration for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.\nARTICLE 22\nExemptions from Origin Declaration\n1.   Products which are sent as small packages from private persons to private persons, or which form part of travellers' personal luggage, shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of an origin declaration, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol, and provided that there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.\n2.   Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or of travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is intended.\n3.   The total value of these products shall not exceed 500 euro in the case of small packages or 1 200 euro in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.\nARTICLE 23\nSupporting Documents\nThe documents referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by an origin declaration can be considered as products originating in the Union or in Singapore and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist, inter alia, of the following:\n(a)\ndirect evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal book-keeping;\n(b)\ndocuments proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in a Party, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law; or\n(c)\ndocuments proving the working or processing of materials in a Party, issued or made out in a Party, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law.\nARTICLE 24\nPreservation of Origin Declaration and Supporting Documents\n1.   The exporter making out an origin declaration shall keep a copy of this origin declaration, as well as the documents referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration), for at least three years.\n2.   The customs authorities of the importing Party shall keep the origin declarations submitted to them for at least three years.\n3.   Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party's laws and regulations, exporters in its territory to maintain documentation or records in any medium, provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed.\nARTICLE 25\nDiscrepancies and Formal Errors\n1.   The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the origin declaration and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purposes of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the origin declaration null and void if it is duly established that that document corresponds to the products submitted.\n2.   Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a origin declaration should not cause the document to be rejected if those errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in the document.\nARTICLE 26\nAmounts Expressed in Euro\n1.   For the application of the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article 22 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Union equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.\n2.   A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article 22 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the Party concerned.\n3.   The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.\n4.   A Member State of the Union may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than five percent. A Member State of the Union may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than fifteen percent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n5.   The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Parties in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees) at the request of the Union or of Singapore. When carrying out this review, the Parties shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For these purposes, the Parties may, by decision in the Committee on Customs, modify the amounts expressed in euro.\nSECTION 6\nARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nARTICLE 27\nCooperation between Competent Authorities\n1.   The customs authorities of the Parties shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying the origin declarations.\n2.   In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Parties shall assist each other, through their competent authorities, in checking the authenticity of origin declarations and the correctness of the information given in such documents.\nARTICLE 28\nVerification of Origin Declarations\n1.   Subsequent verifications of origin declarations shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, if it has been submitted, the customs authorities of the importing Party shall return the origin declaration, or a copy of that document, to the customs authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any document and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the origin declarations is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.\n3.   The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to request any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.\n4.   If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, the release of the products shall be offered to the importer, subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. Any suspension of preferential treatment shall be reinstated as soon as possible after the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol has been ascertained by the customs authorities of the importing Party.\n5.   The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n6.   If, in cases of reasonable doubt, there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or the reply does not contain sufficient information to allow the requesting customs authorities to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities, except in exceptional circumstances, shall refuse entitlement to the preferences.\nARTICLE 29\nAdministrative Enquiries\n1.   Where the results of the verification procedure or any other available substantive information appear to indicate that the provisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the exporting Party, on its own initiative or at the request of the other Party, shall carry out appropriate enquiries or arrange for such enquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions. The results of such enquiries shall be communicated to the Party requesting verification.\n2.   The Party requesting verification may be present at the enquiries, subject to conditions that may be laid down by the competent authority in the exporting Party.\n3.   Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a repeated failure (2) to provide administrative cooperation under this Section, or of systematic and intentional fraud from the other Party, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product or products concerned in accordance with paragraph 4.\n4.   The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe Party which has made a finding in accordance with paragraph 3 shall without undue delay notify the Trade Committee established pursuant to Article 16.1 (Trade Committee) of its finding together with the objective information and its recommended course of action to be taken. Upon receipt of such notification, the Trade Committee shall deliberate on the appropriate course of action on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties. During the period of consultations referred to above, the product(s) concerned shall enjoy the preferential treatment;\n(b)\nwhere the Parties have entered into consultations with the Trade Committee and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in so far as is strictly necessary to address the Party's concerns. Such temporary suspension shall be notified to the Trade Committee without undue delay;\n(c)\ntemporary suspensions under this Article shall be commensurate with the impact on the financial interests of the Party concerned arising from the situation giving rise to the finding of the Party referred to paragraph 3. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed, if at the date of expiry nothing substantive has changed with respect to the condition that gave rise to the initial suspension; and\n(d)\ntemporary suspensions, and any renewal thereof, shall be notified immediately after their adoption to the Trade Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Trade Committee, in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application no longer apply.\nARTICLE 30\nSettlement of Disputes\n1.   Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 28 (Verification of Origin Declarations) which cannot be settled between the competent authorities requesting a verification and the competent authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees).\n2.   All disputes between the importer and the competent authorities of the importing Party shall be settled under the legislation of that Party.\nARTICLE 31\nPenalties\nThe Parties shall provide for procedures for penalties to be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.\nSECTION 7\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\nARTICLE 32\nApplication of this Protocol\n1.   The term ‘Union’ does not cover Ceuta and Melilla.\n2.   Products originating in Singapore, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Union under Protocol 2 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties (3). Singapore shall grant to imports of products covered by the Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Union.\n3.   For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 33 (Special Conditions).\nARTICLE 33\nSpecial Conditions\n1.   Provided that they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 (Non Alteration), the following shall be considered as:\n(a)\nproducts originating in Ceuta and Melilla:\n(i)\nproducts wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;\n(ii)\nproducts obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:\n(aa)\nsuch products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products); or\n(bb)\nthose products are originating in a Party, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).\n(b)\nproducts originating in Singapore:\n(i)\nproducts wholly obtained in Singapore;\n(ii)\nproducts obtained in Singapore in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:\n(aa)\nsuch products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products); or\n(bb)\nsuch products originate in Ceuta and Melilla or in the Union, and provided that they have undergone working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).\n2.   Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.\n3.   The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter ‘Singapore’ and ‘Ceuta and Melilla’ on origin declarations for products originating in these territories respectively.\n4.   The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.\nSECTION 8\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nARTICLE 34\nAmendments to this Protocol\nThe Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may amend the provisions of this Protocol.\nFollowing the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the Union and one or several ASEAN countries, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may amend or adapt this Protocol and in particular Annex C referred to in paragraph 7 of Article 3 (Cumulation of Origin) to ensure coherence between the rules of origin applicable within the context of the preferential exchanges between ASEAN countries and the Union.\nARTICLE 35\nTransitional Provisions for Goods in Transit or Storage\nThis Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Protocol, and which on the date of entry into force of this Agreement are either in transit, in the Parties in temporary storage, in customs warehouses or in free zones, provided that an origin declaration that was made out retrospectively is submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party within twelve months of that date, and, if requested, such declaration is submitted together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly in accordance with Article 13 (Non Alteration).\n(1)  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 of 28 July 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed rules concerning certain provisions of the Union Customs Code (OJ EU L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 1).\n(2)  For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article 29 (Administrative Enquiries), a repeated failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia, a repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned, or a repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of enquiries and/or subsequent verification of the proof of origin, over a continuous period of ten months.\n(3)  OJ EU L 302, 15.11.1985, p. 23.\nANNEX A\nINTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX B\nNote 1 – General introduction\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol. There are four different types of rule, which vary according to the product:\n(a)\nthrough working or processing, a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;\n(b)\nthrough working or processing, the applicable 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit Harmonized System sub-heading for the manufactured products becomes different from the respective 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading for the materials used;\n(c)\na specific working and processing operation is carried out; and\n(d)\nworking or processing is carried out on certain wholly-obtained materials.\nNote 2 – The structure of the list\n2.1.\nThe first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ‘ex’, this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n2.2.\nWhere several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1, or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.\n2.3.\nWhere there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3.\n2.4.\nWhere two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by ‘or’, it is at the choice of the exporter which one to use.\nNote 3 – Examples of how to apply the rules\n3.1.\nArticle 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.\n3.2.\nPursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) of the Protocol, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.\nSubject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status.\nThus, if a rule provides that non-originating material may be used at a certain stage of manufacture, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\nIf a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may not be used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of materials at a later stage is not.\nExample: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that ‘non-originating materials of headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20 per cent weight’, the use (i.e. importation) of cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of manufacture) is not limited.\n3.3.\nWithout prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading’, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.\nThe expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading […]’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.\n3.4.\nWhen a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\n3.5.\nWhere a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the rule does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.\n3.6.\nWhere a rule in the list gives two percentages for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, those percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.\nNote 4 – General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods\n4.1.\nAgricultural goods which fall within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401, and which are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country, shall be treated as originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country.\n4.2.\nIn cases where the content of non originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.\nNote 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products\n5.1.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.\n5.2.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.\n5.3.\nThe terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, but which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n5.4.\nThe term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.\nNote 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials\n6.1.\nWhere, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).\n6.2.\nThe tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n—\nsilk;\n—\nwool;\n—\ncoarse animal hair;\n—\nfine animal hair;\n—\nhorsehair;\n—\ncotton;\n—\npaper-making materials and paper;\n—\nflax;\n—\ntrue hemp;\n—\njute and other textile bast fibres;\n—\nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;\n—\ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;\n—\nsynthetic man-made filaments;\n—\nartificial man-made filaments;\n—\ncurrent-conducting filaments;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);\n—\nother synthetic man-made staple fibres;\n—\nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;\n—\nother artificial man-made staple fibres;\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped;\n—\nproducts of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;\n—\nother products of heading 5605;\n—\nglass fibres;\n—\nmetal fibres.\nExample:\nA yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.\nExample:\nA woollen fabric of heading 5112 that is made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.\nExample:\nTufted textile fabric of heading 5802 that is made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\nExample:\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.\n6.3.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.\n6.4.\nIn the case of products incorporating a ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film, whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, the tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.\nNote 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products\n7.1.\nWhere, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings) which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used, provided that they are classified under a heading other than that of the product, and provided that that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.\n7.2.\nWithout prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.\nExample:\nIf a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\n7.3.\nWhere a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\nNote 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of Chapter 27\n8.1.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation.\n8.2.\nFor the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation;\n(j)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n(k)\nin respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n(l)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n(m)\nin respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;\n(n)\nin respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;\n(o)\nin respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.\n8.3.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.\nANNEX B\nLIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS\nHS Heading\nDescription of product\nWorking or processing, carried out on non-originating materials, which confers originating status\nChapter 1\nLive animals\nAll the animals of Chapter 1 are wholly obtained\nChapter 2\nMeat and edible meat offal\nManufacture in which all the meat and edible meat offal used are wholly obtained\nex Chapter 3\nFish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates, except for:\nAll fish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates are wholly obtained\nex 0301 10\nSaltwater ornamental fish from aquaculture\nRaised there from eggs, larvae, fry or fingerlings for a period of not less than 2 months, in which the value of the eggs, larvae, fry, fingerlings used does not exceed 65 % of the ex-works price of the product\n0304\nFish fillets and other fish meat (whether or not minced), fresh, chilled of frozen\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapter 3 used are wholly obtained\n0305\nFish, dried, salted or in brine;
