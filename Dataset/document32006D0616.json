In accordance with the provision referred to above, this declaration indicates the competence that the Member States have transferred to the Community under the Treaties in matters governed by the Protocol. The scope and the exercise of such Community competence are, by their nature, subject to continuous development as the Community further adopts relevant rules and regulations, and the Community will complete or amend this declaration, if necessary, in accordance with Article 21(3) of the Protocol.\nThe Community points out that it has competence with regard to the crossing of external borders of the Member States, regulating standards and procedures when carrying out checks on persons at such borders and rules on visas for intended stays of no more than three months. The Community is also competent for measures on immigration policy regarding conditions of entry and residence and measures to counter illegal immigration and illegal residence, including repatriation of illegal residents. Moreover, it can take measures to ensure cooperation between the relevant departments of the administrations of the Member States, as well as between those departments and the Commission, in the aforementioned areas. In these fields the Community has adopted rules and regulations and, where it has done so, it is hence solely for the Community to enter into external undertakings with third States or competent international organisations.\nIn addition, Community policy in the sphere of development cooperation complements policies pursued by Member States and includes provisions to prevent and combat smuggling of migrants.", "summary": "Smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air — UN protocol\nSmuggling of migrants by land, sea and air — UN protocol\nSUMMARY OF:\n          \nCouncil decisions 2006/616/EC and 2006/617/EC on the conclusion of the UN protocol against the smuggling of migrants (by land, sea and air), supplementing the UN convention against transnational organised crime\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DO THESE DECISIONS DO?\n              \nThey formally approve the EU's signing of the UN protocol against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea or air to the extent that it falls within EU competence.
