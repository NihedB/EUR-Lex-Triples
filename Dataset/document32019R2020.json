{"celex_id": "32019R2020", "reference": "5.12.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 315/209\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2019/2020\nof 1 October 2019\nlaying down ecodesign requirements for light sources and separate control gears pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Regulations (EC) No 244/2009, (EC) No 245/2009 and (EU) No 1194/2012\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products (1), and in particular Article 15(1) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nPursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC the Commission should set ecodesign requirements for energy-related products which account for significant volumes of sales and trade in the Union and which have a significant environmental impact and presenting significant potential for improvement through design in terms of their environmental impact, without entailing excessive costs.\n(2)\nThe Ecodesign Working Plan 2016-2019 (2) established by the Commission in application of Article 16(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC sets out the working priorities under the ecodesign and energy labelling framework for the period 2016-2019. The Working Plan identifies the energy-related product groups to be considered as priorities for the undertaking of preparatory studies and eventual adoption of implementing measures, as well as the review of the current regulations.\n(3)\nMeasures from the Working Plan have an estimated potential to deliver a total in excess of 260 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030, which is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 100 million tonnes per year in 2030. Lighting is one of the product groups listed in the Working Plan, with an estimated 41,9 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030.\n(4)\nThe Commission established ecodesign requirements for lighting products in Commission Regulations (EC) No 244/2009 (3), (EC) No 245/2009 (4) and (EU) No 1194/2012 (5). Pursuant to those Regulations the Commission should review them in the light of technological progress.\n(5)\nThe Commission has reviewed those Regulations and analysed the technical, environmental and economic aspects of lighting products as well as real-life user behaviour. The review was carried out in close cooperation with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and third countries. The results of the review were made public and presented to the Consultation Forum established by Article 18 of Directive 2009/125/EC.\n(6)\nThe review shows the benefit of updating the requirements for lighting products and the benefit of simplifying the requirements to be applied to lighting products, in particular by having one single regulation for this product group. This is in line with the Commission's ‘Better Regulation’ policy and should decrease the administrative burden for manufacturers and importers, and to facilitate verification by market surveillance authorities, inter alia, by better defining the scope and exemptions, reducing the number of parameters for compliance testing and decreasing the time of some test procedures.\n(7)\nIn accordance with the review, broadly, all lighting products that fall within the scope of the three existing regulations should be covered by this Regulation. Furthermore, a uniform formula should be set to calculate the energy efficiency of such lighting products.\n(8)\nThe annual electricity consumption of products subject to this Regulation in the Union was estimated at 336 TWh in 2015. This covers 12,4 % of the overall use of electricity by the 28 Member States and corresponds to 132 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. The energy consumption of lighting products in a business-as-usual scenario is projected to decrease by 2030. However, this reduction is expected to slow down unless the existing ecodesign requirements are updated.\n(9)\nThe environmental aspects of lighting products that have been identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation are energy consumption in the use phase along with mercury content.\n(10)\nThe use of hazardous substances, including mercury in light sources, is governed by Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (RoHS) (6). No specific ecodesign requirements on mercury content should therefore be set in this Regulation.\n(11)\nThe Commission Communication on the circular economy (7) and the Working Plan underline the importance of using the ecodesign framework to support the move towards more resource efficient and circular economy. Directive 2012/19/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) refers to Directive 2009/125/EC and indicates that ecodesign requirements should facilitate the re-use, dismantling and recovery of waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) by tackling the issues upstream. The WEEE Directive sets requirements for separate collection and recycling of lighting products, with new provisions from August 2018. This Regulation should therefore not lay down further requirements for this. At the same time, this Regulation supports the repairability of products containing light sources.\n(12)\nIn view of the need to promote the circular economy and the ongoing work for material efficiency standardisation in relation to energy-related products, future standardisation work should also address the modularisation of LED lighting products, including aspects such as luminous flux, radiation spectrum and light distribution.\n(13)\nSpecific requirements for the standby and networked standby electric power demand of lighting products should be laid down. Therefore, the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1275/2008 (9) should not apply to lighting products covered by the scope of this Regulation.\n(14)\nMandatory ecodesign requirements apply to products placed on the Union market wherever they are installed or used and should therefore not be made dependent on the application in which the product is used.\n(15)\nExemptions from the requirements set out in this Regulation should be made for light sources with special technical features for use in specific applications, including those related to health and safety, and for which higher energy efficiency alternatives are not available or not cost-effective.\n(16)\nThe relevant product parameters should be measured using reliable, accurate and reproducible methods. Those methods should take into account recognised state-of-the-art measurement methods, including, where available, harmonised standards adopted by the European standardisation organisations, as listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(17)\nIn accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2009/125/EC, this Regulation should specify the applicable conformity assessment procedures.\n(18)\nTo facilitate compliance checks, manufacturers, importers or authorised representatives should provide information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V to Directive 2009/125/EC in so far as that information relates to the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The parameters of the technical documentation in accordance with this Regulation which are identical to the parameters of the product information sheet in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2015 (11) and which have been entered in the product database established by Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) should no longer be included in the technical documentation of this Regulation.\n(19)\nThis Regulation should specify tolerance values for lighting parameters taking into account the approach to information declaration laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/2282 (13).\n(20)\nTo improve the effectiveness of this Regulation and to protect consumers, products that automatically alter their performance in test conditions to improve the declared parameters should be prohibited.\n(21)\nIn addition to the legally binding requirements laid down in this Regulation, indicative benchmarks for best available technologies should be identified to make information on products' environmental performance over their life cycle subject to this Regulation widely available and easily accessible, in accordance with Directive 2009/125/EC, Annex 1, part 3, point 2.\n(22)\nA review of this Regulation should assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of its provisions in achieving its goals. The timing of the review should allow for all provisions to be implemented and show an effect on the market.\n(23)\nRegulations (EC) No 244/2009, (EC) No 245/2009 and (EU) No 1194/2012 should therefore be repealed.\n(24)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

measured parameters by Member State authorities. These tolerances shall not be used by the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative as an allowed tolerance to establish the values in the technical documentation or in interpreting these values with a view to achieving compliance or to communicate better performance by any means.\nWhere a model has been designed to be able to detect it is being tested (e.g. by recognising the test conditions or test cycle), and to react specifically by automatically altering its performance during the test with the objective of reaching a more favourable level for any of the parameters specified in this Regulation or included in the technical documentation or included in any of the documentation provided, the model and all equivalent models shall be considered not compliant.\nWhen verifying the compliance of a product model with the requirements laid down in this Regulation pursuant to Article 3(2) of Directive 2009/125/EC, the authorities of the Member States shall apply the following procedure:\n1.\nThe Member State authorities shall verify one single unit of the model for points 2(a) and 2(b) of this Annex.\nThe Member State authorities shall verify 10 units of the light source model or 3 units of the separate control gear model. The verification tolerances are laid down in Table 6 of this Annex.\n2.\nThe model shall be considered to comply with the applicable requirements if:\n(a)\nthe values given in the technical documentation pursuant to point 2 of Annex IV to Directive 2009/125/EC (declared values), and, where applicable, the values used to calculate these values, are not more favourable for the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative than the results of the corresponding measurements carried out pursuant to paragraph (g) thereof; and\n(b)\nthe declared values meet any requirements laid down in this Regulation, and any required product information published by the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative does not contain values that are more favourable for the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative than the declared values; and\n(c)\nwhen the authorities of the Member State test the units of the model, the determined values comply with the respective verification tolerances as given in Table 6 of this Annex, where ‘determined value’ means the arithmetic mean over the tested units of the measured values for a given parameter or the arithmetic mean of parameter values calculated from measured values.\n3.\nIf the results referred to in point 2(a), (b) or (c) are not achieved, the model and all equivalent models shall be considered not to comply with this Regulation.\n4.\nThe authorities of the Member State shall provide all relevant information to the authorities of the other Member States and to the Commission without delay after a decision is taken on the non-compliance of the model in accordance with point 3 of this Annex.\nThe authorities of the Member State shall only apply the verification tolerances that are set out in Table 6 and shall use only the procedure described in this Annex. For the parameters in Table 6, no other tolerances, such as those set out in harmonised standards or in any other measurement method, shall be applied.\nTable 6\nVerification tolerances\nParameter\nSample size\nVerification tolerances\nFull-load on-mode power Pon\n [W]:\nPon ≤ 2W\n10\nThe determined value shall not exceed the declared value by more than 0,20  W.\n2W < Pon ≤ 5W\n10\nThe determined value shall not exceed the declared value by more than 10 %.\n5W < Pon ≤ 25W\n10\nThe determined value shall not exceed the declared value by more than 5 %.\n25W < Pon ≤ 100W\n10\nThe determined value shall not exceed the declared value by more than 5 %.\n100W < Pon\n10\nThe determined value shall not exceed the declared value by more than 2,5  %.\nDisplacement factor [0-1]\n10\nThe determined value shall not be less than the declared value minus 0,1  units.\nUseful luminous flux Φuse\n [lm]\n10\nThe determined value shall not be less than the declared value minus 10 %.\nNo-load power Pno, Standby power Psb and Networked standby power Pnet [W]\n10\nThe determined value shall not exceed the declared value by more than 0,10  W.\nCRI [0-100]\n10\nThe determined value shall not be less than the declared value by more than 2,0  units.\nFlicker [Pst LM] and stroboscopic effect [SVM]\n10\nThe determined value shall not exceed the declared value by more than 10 %.\nColour consistency [MacAdam ellips steps]\n10\nThe determined number of steps shall not exceed the declared number of steps.

The light source manufacturer or importer shall indicate which separate control gear is suitable for this length.\nWhen verifying if a product is a light source, market surveillance authorities shall compare the measured values for chromaticity coordinates (x and y), luminous flux, luminous flux density, and colour rendering index directly with the limit values set out in the definition for light source of Article 2 of this Regulation, without applying any tolerances. If any of the 10 units in the sample satisfies the conditions for being a light source, the product model shall be considered to be a light source.\nLight sources that allow the end-user to control, manually or automatically, directly or remotely, the luminous intensity, colour, correlated colour temperature, spectrum, and/or beam angle of the emitted light shall be evaluated using the reference control settings.\n(1)  There is no tolerance associated with this metric, as it is a fixed requirement and it is up to the manufacturer to declare an L70B50 value to meet it.\nANNEX V\nFunctionality after endurance testing\nModels of LED- and OLED- light sources shall undergo endurance testing to verify their lumen maintenance and survival factor. This endurance testing consists of the test method outlined below. The authorities of a Member State shall test 10 units of the model for this test.\nThe endurance test for LED and OLED light sources shall be conducted as follows:\n(a)\nAmbient conditions and test setup:\n(i)\nThe switching cycles are to be conducted in a room with an ambient temperature of 25 ± 10 °C and an average air velocity of less than 0,2 m/s.\n(ii)\nThe switching cycles on the sample shall be conducted in free air in a vertical base-up position. However, if a manufacturer or importer has declared the light source suitable for use in a specific orientation only, then the sample shall be mounted in that orientation.\n(iii)\nThe applied voltage during the switching cycles shall have a tolerance within 2 %. The total harmonic content of the supply voltage shall not exceed 3 %. Standards provide guidance on the supply voltage source. Light sources designed to be operated on mains voltage shall be tested at 230 V, 50 Hz supply, even if the products are able to be operated on variable supply conditions.\n(b)\nEndurance test method:\n(i)\nInitial flux measurement: measure the luminous flux of the light source prior to starting the endurance test switching cycle.\n(ii)\nSwitching cycles: operate the light source for 1 200 cycles of repeated, continuous switching cycles without interruption. One complete switching cycle consists of 150 minutes of the light source switched ON at full power followed by 30 minutes of the light source switched OFF. The hours of operation recorded (i.e. 3 000 hours) include only the periods of the switching cycle when the light source was switched ON, i.e. the total test time is 3 600 hours.\n(iii)\nFinal flux measurement: at the end of the 1 200 switching cycles, note if any light sources have failed (see ‘Survival factor’ in Annex IV, Table 6 of this Regulation) and measure the luminous flux of the light sources that have not failed.\n(iv)\nFor each of the units in the sample which have not failed, divide the measured final flux by the measured initial flux. Average the resulting values over all the units that did not fail to compute the determined value for the lumen maintenance factor XLMF %.\nANNEX VI\nBenchmarks\nFor the environmental aspects that were considered significant and are quantifiable, the best available technology on the market, at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, is indicated below.\nThe best available technology on the market for light sources in terms of their efficacy based on useful luminous flux was identified as follows:\n—\nMains voltage non-directional light sources: 120-140 lm/W\n—\nMains voltage directional light sources: 90-100 lm/W\n—\nDirectional light sources not operating on the mains: 85- 95 lm/W\n—\nLinear light sources (tubes): 140-160 lm/W\nThe best available technology on the market for separate control gears has an energy efficiency of 95 %.\nFeatures required in certain applications, e.g. a high colour rendering, might prevent products offering those features from achieving these benchmarks.\nThe best available technology on the market for light sources and separate control gears do not have any mercury content.", "summary": "Ecodesign and energy labelling — light sources and separate control gear\nEcodesign and energy labelling — light sources and separate control gear\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2020 on ecodesign requirements for light sources and separate control gears\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2015 on energy labelling of light sources\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2020 establishes ecodesign* requirements for the sale or putting into service of light sources and separate control gears.

It does not include power supplies.\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2020:\nstipulates in Annex II the date (1 September 2021) when the ecodesign requirements come into force, covering energy efficiencyfunctional requirementsinformation and labelling for professionals and end-users;\nsets out exemptions in Annex III for light sources or control gear specifically designed to operate in potentially explosive atmospheresfor emergency usein radiological and nuclear medicine installationsin or on military or civil defence establishments, equipment, ground vehicles, marine equipment or aircraftin or on motor vehicles, their trailers and systems, towed equipment, components and separate technical unitsin or on non-road mobile machineryin or on certain equipment intended to be towedin or on civil aviation aircraftin railway vehicle lightingin marine equipmentin medical devices;\nsets out additional exemptions, such as electronic displays (e.g. televisions, computer monitors, notebooks, tablets, mobile phones and game consoles)light sources and separate control gears in battery-operated products, including torches, mobile phones with an integrated torch light, toys including light sources and desk lamps operating only on batterieslight sources for spectroscopy and photometric applicationslight sources and separate control gears on bicycles and other non-motorised vehiclescertain other light sources listed in Annex III, which must only fulfil the information requirements in the regulation.\nNational authorities must apply the verification procedures laid down in Annex IV when carrying out market surveillance checks.\nModels of inorganic and organic light emitting diode light sources must undergo endurance testing to verify their lumen maintenance and survival factor.\nAnnex VI sets out indicative benchmarks for the environmental aspects considered significant and quantifiable, based on the best available technology.\nThe European Commission must review the regulation in the light of technological progress and to assess a number of aspects 5 years after its entry into force.\nUnder Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2015:\nSuppliers of light sources must ensure that: each light source has a printed label on the packaging, in the format set out in Annex III;the parameters of the product information sheet and the content of the technical documentation, as set out in Annexes V and VI, are entered into the product database;on request by dealers, product information sheets are made available in printed form;visual advertising and any technical promotional material, including technical promotional material on the internet, contains the energy efficiency class of the light source model and the range of energy efficiency classes available on the label, in accordance with Annex VII and Annex VIII;an electronic label in the format and containing the information, as set out in Annex III, is made available to dealers for each light source model;an electronic product information sheet, as set out in Annex V, is made available to dealers for each light source model;on request by dealers, printed rescaled* product labels are provided as a sticker of the same size as the one which already exists.\nDealers must ensure that: at the point of sale, each light source bears the clearly visible energy class label provided by suppliers;in the event of distance selling, the label and product information sheet are provided;any visual advertising or technical promotional material, including on the internet, contains the energy efficiency class of the lighting source model and the range of energy efficiency classes available on the label;existing labels on light sources at points of sale are covered by the rescaled labels, at the latest 18 months after the application date of the regulation.\nWhere an internet hosting service provider allows the selling of light sources through its internet site, the service provider must enable the display of the electronic label and electronic product information sheet provided by the dealer and must inform the dealer of the obligation to display them.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2021/340 amends Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2015 by: replacing the definition of containing product*;requiring the values of the parameters included in the product information sheet, as set out in Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2019/2015, to be entered into the public part of the product database (applies from 1 March 2022);allowing dealers, on request, to use printed labels to rescale products in the form of a sticker, of the same size as the one which already exists;allowing suppliers, when placing a light source on the market, to provide it with the existing label until 31 August 2021 and with the rescaled label from 1 September 2021 — the supplier may choose to already provide light sources placed on the market during the period from 1 July to 31 August 2021 with the rescaled label, if no light sources belonging to the same model or equivalent models were placed on the market before 1 July 2021: in that case, the dealer must not offer those light sources for sale before 1 September 2021;allowing existing labels on light sources at points of sale to be replaced by the rescaled labels in such a way as to cover the existing label, including when printed on or attached to the package, within 18 months after the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2019/2015, and rescaled labels are not displayed before that date.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\n              \nThey have both applied since 1 September 2021.\nBACKGROUND\nDirective 2009/125/EC establishes a framework to set ecodesign requirements for energy-related products. It tasks the Commission with setting these for products which are widely sold and traded in the EU and have a significant environmental impact.\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1369 establishes a framework to set energy labelling requirements for energy-related products to enable consumers to choose more efficient products to reduce their energy consumption.\nFor more information, see: The new ecodesign measures explained (European Commission)About the energy label and ecodesign (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nEcodesign: a policy to improve, through better design, products’ environmental performance throughout their life cycle, especially their energy efficiency.\nRescaled product labels: energy efficiency labels that were reclassified, so that products previously ranging from ‘A+++’ to ‘G’ were replaced by ‘A’ to ‘G’ to balance out the high number of the more energy-efficient classes.\nContaining product: a product containing one or more light sources, separate control gears or both. Examples of containing products are luminaires that can be taken apart to allow separate verification of the contained light source(s), household appliances containing light source(s) and furniture (shelves, mirrors, display cabinets) containing light source(s). If a containing product cannot be taken apart for verification of the light source and separate control gear, the entire containing product is to be considered a light source.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) 2019/2020 of 1 October 2019 laying down ecodesign requirements for light sources and separate control gears pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Regulations (EC) No 244/2009, (EC) No 245/2009 and (EU) No 1194/2012 (OJ L 315, 5.12.2019, pp. 209-240)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2020 have been incorporated into the original text.
