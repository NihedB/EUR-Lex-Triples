The registries of the Parties shall meet the criteria set out in Annex I, Part C.\n2.   To operationalise the link between the EU ETS and the ETS of Switzerland, a direct link between the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL) of the Union registry and the Swiss Supplementary Transaction Log (SSTL) of the Swiss registry shall be established, which will enable the registry-to-registry transfer of emission allowances issued under either ETS.\n3.   The registry link shall, inter alia:\n(a)\nbe administered for Switzerland by the Swiss registry administrator and for the Union by the Union central administrator,\n(b)\noperate in accordance with the applicable laws in each jurisdiction,\n(c)\nbe supported by automated processes integrated into both the Swiss registry and the Union registry to enable transactions,\n(d)\nbe implemented so as to ensure, to the extent possible, consistent functionality for users of the Swiss registry and the Union registry.\n4.   The Swiss registry administrator, the Union central administrator or both administrators jointly may temporarily close the registry link for system maintenance, security breach or security risk in accordance with the applicable Swiss and European Union legislations. The Parties shall give notice as early as possible of a temporary closure of the registry link for system maintenance, security breach or security risk and shall make the temporary closure as brief as possible.\n5.   The Parties shall act promptly and in close cooperation using measures available in their respective jurisdictions to prevent fraud and to preserve market integrity of the linked ETS. In the context of the linked ETS, the Swiss registry administrator, the Union central administrator and national administrators from Member States of the Union shall work together to minimise the risk of fraud, misuse or criminal activity involving the registries, to respond to such incidents, and to protect the integrity of the registry link. Measures agreed by the administrators to address the risk of fraud, misuse or criminal activity shall be adopted by decision of the Joint Committee.\n6.   The Swiss registry administrator and the Union central administrator shall determine common operational procedures (COP) related to technical or other matters necessary for the operation of the linking and taking into account the priorities of domestic legislation. The COP developed by the administrators shall take effect when adopted by decision of the Joint Committee.\n7.   The Swiss registry administrator and the Union central administrator shall develop Linking Technical Standards (LTS) based on the principles set out in Annex II, describing the detailed requirements for establishing a robust and secure connection between the SSTL and the EUTL. The LTS developed by the administrators shall take effect when adopted by decision of the Joint Committee.\n8.   Issues requiring resolution arising out of the implementation and operation of the registry link shall be resolved through timely consultation by the Swiss registry administrator and the Union central administrator and in accordance with the determined COP.\nArticle 4\nEmission allowances and accounting\n1.   Emission allowances that can be used for compliance under the ETS of one Party shall be recognised for compliance under the ETS of the other Party.\n‘Emission allowance’ means an allowance to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent during a specified period, which has been issued under the EU ETS or the ETS of Switzerland valid for the purposes of meeting the requirements under the EU ETS or the ETS of Switzerland.\n2.   Existing restrictions on the use of specific allowances in one ETS may be applied in the other ETS.\n3.   The ETS in which an emission allowance was issued shall be identifiable to the registry administrators and the account holders on the basis of at least the country code of the serial number of the emission allowance.\n4.   Each Party shall inform the other Party on at least an annual basis of the total holdings of emission allowances issued under the other ETS, and of the number of emission allowances issued under the other ETS that have been surrendered for compliance or that have been cancelled voluntarily.\n5.   Parties shall account for net flows of allowances in accordance with UNFCCC approved principles and rules for accounting following their entry into force. This mechanism shall be determined in an Annex to this Agreement adopted by decision of the Joint Committee.\n6.   Upon entry into force of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the Parties shall transfer or acquire a sufficient number of Assigned Amount Units (‘AAUs’) valid for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol at an agreed interval, and in case of termination in accordance with Article 16, to account for net flows of allowances between the Parties to the extent that such allowances have been surrendered by ETS operators for compliance and to the extent that such allowances represent emissions included in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol. The mechanism for such transactions shall be determined in an Annex to this Agreement adopted by decision of the Joint Committee following the entry into force of the amendment of the Kyoto Protocol. That Annex shall also include an agreement on the management of the share of proceeds applied to the first international transfer of AAUs.\nArticle 5\nAuctioning\n1.   Allowances shall be sold by the Parties through auctioning only.\n2.   Operators under either ETS shall be eligible to apply for admission to bid in auctions for allowances. Access to such auctions for operators under either ETS shall be given on a non-discriminatory basis. To ensure the integrity of the auctions, the eligibility to apply for admission to the auctions may only be extended to other categories of participants that are regulated under the laws of a Party or that are specifically authorised to participate in auctions.\n3.   Auctioning shall be conducted in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory manner and according to the criteria set out in Annex I, Part D.\nCHAPTER III\nAVIATION\nArticle 6\nInclusion of aviation activities\nAviation activities shall be included by the Parties in their respective ETS in accordance with the essential criteria set out in Annex I, Part B. Inclusion of aviation activities in the ETS of Switzerland shall reflect the same principles as those of the EU ETS, in particular with regard to coverage, cap and allocation rules.\nArticle 7\nReview of this Agreement in the case of changes concerning aviation activities\n1.   In the case of changes regarding aviation activities in the EU ETS, the corresponding Annex I, Part B shall be reviewed by the Joint Committee pursuant to Article 13(2).\n2.   The Joint Committee shall in any event convene by the end of 2018 to review the relevant provisions of this Agreement regarding the scope of coverage of aviation activities pursuant to Article 13(2).\nCHAPTER IV\nSENSITIVE INFORMATION AND SECURITY\nArticle 8\nSensitive information\n1.   ‘Sensitive information’ means information and material, whether in oral, visual, electronic, magnetic or documentary form, including equipment and technology, which has been provided by or exchanged between the Parties in connection with this Agreement and (i) the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause varying degrees of damage or harm to the interests of Switzerland, the Union or one or more of the Member States of the Union; (ii) which requires protection against unauthorised disclosure in the security interests of one of the Parties; and (iii) which bears a sensitivity marking assigned by one of the Parties.\n2.   Without prejudice to the respective laws and regulations of the Parties, each Party shall protect sensitive information, in particular against unauthorised disclosure or integrity loss, in accordance with the security requirements, the sensitivity levels and the handling instructions set out in Annexes II, III, and IV respectively. ‘Handling’ includes generating, processing, storing, transmitting or destroying the sensitive information or any other information contained therein.\nArticle 9\nSensitivity levels\n1.   Each Party is solely responsible for marking the information it releases as sensitive and for downgrading or removing the level of sensitivity of information it releases. Where sensitive information is released jointly by the Parties, the Parties shall agree together on the marking and the level of sensitivity, as well as the downgrading and removal of the level of sensitivity.\n2.   Sensitive information shall be marked ETS CRITICAL, ETS SENSITIVE or ETS LIMITED in accordance with its level of sensitivity as set out in Annex III.\n3.   The sensitive information originator of the releasing Party shall downgrade sensitive information to a lower sensitivity level as soon as it ceases to require a higher degree of protection and shall remove the sensitivity status as soon as the information ceases to require protection against unauthorised disclosure or loss of integrity.\n4.   The releasing Party shall inform the recipient Party of any new sensitive information and its level of sensitivity, as well as of any downgrades in sensitivity level or removals of sensitivity status.\n5.   A shared sensitive information list shall be established and maintained by the Parties.\nCHAPTER V\nDEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION\nArticle 10\nDevelopment of legislation\n1.

The main elements of the auctioning method, including the schedule, dates and estimated volumes of sales shall be published on the website of the entity conducting the auction at least one month before the start of the auction. Any significant adjustment shall be announced as early as practicable in advance as well.\n5\nThe auctioning of allowances shall be performed with the objective of minimising any impact on the ETS of each Party. The entity in charge of auctioning shall ensure that the auctioning prices do not deviate significantly from the relevant price for allowances in the secondary market over the auctioning period, a situation which would indicate a deficiency of the auctions.\n6\nAll non-confidential information pertinent to the auctions, including all legislation, guidance and forms, shall be published in an open and transparent manner. The results of each auction conducted shall be published as soon as is reasonably practicable and include the relevant non-confidential information. Reports on the results of the auctions shall be published at least annually.\n7\nThe auctioning of allowances shall be subject to adequate rules and procedures to mitigate the risk of anti-competitive behaviour, market abuse, money-laundering and terrorist financing in auctions. Such rules and procedures shall be, to the extent possible, not less stringent than those applicable to financial markets in the respective legal regimes of the Parties.

It shall also monitor the behaviour of market participants and notify the competent public authorities in the event of anti-competitive behaviour, market abuse, money laundering or terrorist financing.\n8\nThe entity conducting the auctions and the auctioning of allowances shall be subject to adequate supervision by competent authorities. Designated competent authorities shall have necessary legal competences and technical arrangements to supervise:\n—\nthe organisation and conduct of operators of auction platforms;\n—\nthe organisation and conduct of professional intermediaries acting on behalf of clients;\n—\nthe behaviour and transactions of market participants, in order to prevent insider dealing and market manipulation;\n—\nthe transactions of market participants, in order to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.\nTo the extent possible, the supervision shall not be less stringent than the supervision on financial markets in the respective legal regimes of the Parties.\nSwitzerland shall endeavour to make use of a private entity for the auctioning of its allowances, in accordance with public procurement rules.\nUntil such an entity is contracted, and provided that the number of allowances to be auctioned in a year is below a fixed threshold, Switzerland may continue to use the current arrangements for auctioning, namely the auctions operated by the FOEN, under the following conditions:\n1.\nThe threshold shall be 1 000 000 allowances, including allowances to be auctioned for aviation activities.\n2.\nThe essential criteria under points 1 to 8 shall apply, with the exception of criteria 1 and 2, while the criteria 7 and 8 only apply to the FOEN to the extent possible. Essential criteria under point 3 shall apply, together with the following provision: admission to bid in auctions of Swiss allowances under the arrangements for auctioning which were in place at the time this Agreement was signed, shall be guaranteed for all entities in the EEA which are admitted to bid in auctions in the Union.\nSwitzerland may mandate entities conducting the auction which are located in the EEA.\nANNEX II\nLINKING TECHNICAL STANDARDS\nThe Linking Technical Standards (LTS) shall specify:\n—\nthe architecture of the communication link;\n—\nthe security of data transfer;\n—\nthe list of functions (transactions, reconciliation …);\n—\nthe definition of the web services;\n—\nthe data logging requirements;\n—\nthe operational arrangements (Call desk, support);\n—\nthe communication activation plan and the testing procedure;\n—\nthe security testing procedure.\nThe LTS shall specify that the administrators shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the SSTL, the EUTL and the link are operational 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, and that any interruptions to the operation of the SSTL, the EUTL and the link are kept to the minimum.\nThe LTS shall specify that the communications between the SSTL and the EUTL consist of secure exchanges of Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages based on the following technologies (1):\n—\nweb services using SOAP;\n—\nhardware-based Virtual Private Network (VPN);\n—\nXML (Extensible Markup Language);\n—\ndigital signature; and\n—\nnetwork time protocols.\nThe LTS shall set out additional security requirements for the Swiss registry, the SSTL, the Union registry and the EUTL and shall be documented in a ‘security management plan’. In particular, the LTS shall specify that:\n—\nif there is a suspicion that the security of the Swiss registry, the SSTL, the Union registry or the EUTL has been compromised, both Parties shall immediately inform each other and suspend the link between the SSTL and the EUTL;\n—\nin the event of a security breach, the Parties shall commit to immediately share the information with each other. To the extent that the technical details are available, a report describing the incident (date, cause, impact, remedies) shall be shared between the Swiss registry administrator and the Union central administrator within 24 hours after the security breach.\nThe security testing procedure set out in the LTS shall be completed before the communication link between the SSTL and the EUTL is established, and whenever a new version or release of the SSTL or the EUTL is required.\nThe LTS shall provide two testing environments in addition to the Production environment: a developer testing environment and an acceptance environment.\nThe Parties shall provide evidence through the Swiss registry administrator and the Union central administrator that an independent security assessment of their systems has been performed in the last twelve months in accordance with the security requirements set out in the LTS. Security testing and in particular penetration testing shall be performed on all new major releases of the software in accordance with the security requirements set out in the LTS. The penetration testing shall not be performed by the software developer or by a subcontractor of the software developer.\n(1)  Those technologies are currently used for establishing a connection between the Union Registry and the International Transaction Log as well as between the Swiss Registry and the International Transaction Log.\nANNEX III\nSENSITIVITY LEVELS AND HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS\nThe Parties shall make use of the following sensitivity levels to identify sensitive information that is handled and exchanged within this Agreement:\n—\nETS Limited\n—\nETS Sensitive\n—\nETS Critical\nInformation that is marked as ‘ETS Critical’ is more sensitive than information that is marked as ‘ETS Sensitive’, which in turn is more sensitive than information that is marked as ‘ETS Limited’.\nThe Parties agree to develop handling instructions on the basis of the existing ETS information classification policy of the Union and on the basis of the Information Protection Ordinance (IPO) and the Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) of Switzerland.

Those ratings allow the global sensitivity level of the information to be evaluated by means of the mapping table provided in section A.3.\nA.2 – Confidentiality and Integrity rating\nA.2.1 – ‘Low rating’\nA low rating shall be given to any information relating to the ETS the disclosure to unauthorised persons, and/or loss of integrity of which would cause moderate damage to the Parties or other institutions which, in turn, would be likely to:\n—\nmoderately affect political or diplomatic relations;\n—\ncause local negative publicity to the image or reputation of the Parties or other institutions;\n—\ncause embarrassment to individuals;\n—\naffect staff morale/productivity;\n—\ncause limited financial loss or, moderately facilitate improper gain or advantage for individuals or companies;\n—\nmoderately affect the effective development or operation of the Parties' policies;\n—\nmoderately affect the proper management of the Parties and their operations.\nA.2.2 – ‘Medium rating’\nA medium rating shall be given to any information relating to the ETS the disclosure to unauthorised persons, and/or loss of integrity of which would cause damage to the Parties or other institutions which, in turn, would be likely to:\n—\ncause embarrassment to political or diplomatic relations;\n—\ncause damage to the image or reputation of the Parties or other institutions;\n—\ncause distress to individuals;\n—\ncause consequential reduction in staff morale/productivity;\n—\nembarrass the Parties or other institutions in commercial or policy negotiations with others;\n—\ncause financial loss or facilitate improper gain or advantage for individuals or companies;\n—\naffect the investigation of crime;\n—\nbreach legal or contractual obligations on confidentiality of information;\n—\naffect the development or operation of the Parties' policies;\n—\naffect the proper management of the Parties and their operations.\nA.2.3 – ‘High rating’\nA high rating shall be given to any information relating to the ETS the disclosure to unauthorised persons, and/or loss of integrity of which would cause catastrophic and/or unacceptable damage to the Parties or other institutions which, in turn, would be likely to:\n—\nadversely affect diplomatic relations;\n—\ncause substantial distress to individuals;\n—\nmake it more difficult to maintain the operational effectiveness or security of Parties or other contributors' forces;\n—\ncause financial loss or facilitate improper gain or advantage for individuals or companies;\n—\nbreach proper undertakings to maintain the confidence of information provided by third parties;\n—\nbreach statutory restrictions on disclosure of information;\n—\nprejudice the investigation or facilitate the commission of crime;\n—\ndisadvantage the Parties in commercial or policy negotiations with others;\n—\nimpede the effective development or operation of the Parties' policies;\n—\nundermine the proper management of the Parties and their operations.\nA.3 – ETS Sensitive information level assessment\nBased on the ratings for Confidentiality and for Integrity pursuant to section A.2, the global information sensitivity level is established using the following mapping table:\nConfidentiality rating\nIntegrity rating\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\nLow\nETS Limited\nETS Sensitive\n(or ETS Limited (*1))\nETS Critical\nMedium\nETS Sensitive\n(or ETS Limited (*1))\nETS Sensitive\n(or ETS Critical (*1))\nETS Critical\nHigh\nETS Critical\nETS Critical\nETS Critical\n(*1)  Possible variation to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.", "summary": "Agreement between the EU and Switzerland on the greenhouse gas emissions trading system (ETS)\nAgreement between the EU and Switzerland on the greenhouse gas emissions trading system (ETS)\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement between the EU and Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems\nDecision (EU) 2017/2240 on the signing and provisional application of the agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems\nDecision (EU) 2018/219 on the conclusion of the agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT?\nThe agreement aims to link the EU’s emissions trading system (EU ETS) with Switzerland’s ETS (CHETS). The EU considers its emissions trading system (ETS) to be a policy tool which cost-effectively reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Linking emissions trading systems to enable the trade of emission allowances between systems will help build a robust international carbon emission market and further reinforce the emission-reduction efforts of the parties who have linked their systems, thus contributing also towards the objectives of the Paris agreement on climate change.\nThe linking of the two systems will only become fully operational once the Switzerland has brought into force all the requisite rules in its national legislation, notably on extending its ETS to aviation. However, under the terms of this agreement, the Joint Committee (JC) it set up started functioning from the signing of the agreement (November 2017) in order to ensure coordination between the parties, including on developments regarding the entry into force of the relevant Swiss rules.\nKEY POINTS\nCap and trade: how the EU ETS works\nThe EU ETS, set up by Directive 2003/87/EC, works on the ‘cap and trade’ principle. A cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by power plants and industrial installations covered by the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall.\nBesides stationary installations, the EU ETS applies to all flights between airports in the EU and the European Economic Area.\nWithin the cap, companies receive or buy emission allowances* which they can then trade with one another as needed. Before 2021 they could also use limited amounts of international credits from emission-saving projects around the world for compliance with the system. The limit on the total number of allowances available ensures that they retain their value.\nEach year a company must hand over enough allowances to cover all its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed. If a company reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future needs or else sell them to another company that is short of allowances.\nTrading brings flexibility that ensures emissions are cut where it is most cost-effective. It also promotes investment in clean, low-carbon technologies.\nEU-Swiss agreement\nThe agreement sets out the key objectives and principles, as well as the institutional structure, for linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading systems.\nOnce the link between the EU ETS and the CH ETS becomes operational, emission allowances that originate from one system are eligible for compliance with the other system.\nEssential criteria\nTo ensure the 2 systems are compatible, certain essential criteria, laid down in an annex to the agreement, must be met. These criteria largely reflect the provisions of the EU ETS legislation or its implementing acts. Either system can adopt rules that are more stringent than the essential criteria.\nThe agreement allows for the possibility of future legislative developments in the linked systems without the need for substantial renegotiation as long as the systems continue to meet the essential criteria.\nInformation sharing and coordination\nThe agreement establishes a process for information sharing and coordination in areas of relevance. This is to ensure its proper implementation and the ongoing integrity of the linked systems. This process permits the parties to keep each other informed of relevant legislative developments.\nAviation\nThe agreement clarifies that Switzerland will mirror the EU ETS provisions on aviation in the CH ETS for the linking of the two emissions trading systems to enter into force.\nAviation operators will be administered by an EEA state or Switzerland under the ‘one-stop shop’ approach. This means that a single authority takes responsibility for the implementation of the 2 systems so that operators will only have to deal with one authority under the linked system.\nThe special situation of the bi-national Basel airport is addressed to avoid double-counting, should Switzerland reach a bilateral agreement on the coverage of activities from Basel airport.\nJoint Committee\nThe agreement establishes a JC as its main steering structure. The JC:\ncomprises representatives of both parties and is responsible for the administration and proper implementation of the agreement;\nplays a key role in the information sharing and coordination process, as well as in assessing whether the parties continue to meet the essential criteria;\ncan propose changes to articles of the agreement and make amendments to the annexes;\nbecame functional from the date of signature of the agreement under the terms of the agreement on the provisional application of certain articles.\nDispute-settlement mechanism\nDisputes on the interpretation or application of the agreement can be referred by either party to the JC for resolution. Where the JC is unsuccessful in settling the dispute within 6 months, it can be referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the request of either party.\nTechnical rules\nIn addition to the principles, objectives and institutional arrangements, the agreement contains technical provisions governing the operation of registries, accounting, auctioning, sensitive information and security.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 1 January 2020.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information see:\nEU and Switzerland sign agreement to link emissions trading systems (European Commission)\nGreen light for the agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading systems (Council of the EU)\nEU emissions trading system (EU ETS) (EUR-Lex).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nEmission allowance: an allowance to emit 1 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent during a specified period, issued by the EU ETS or the CH ETS.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems (OJ L 322, 7.12.2017, pp. 3-26)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2017/2240 of 10 November 2017 on the signing, on behalf of the Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems (OJ L 322, 7.12.2017, pp. 1-2)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2018/219 of 23 January 2018 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems (OJ L 43, 16.2.2018, pp. 1-2)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nNotice concerning the entry into force of the Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems (OJ L 330, 20.12.2019, p. 1)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2018/1279 of 18 September 2018 on the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Joint Committee established by the Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems regarding the adoption of its Rules of Procedure (OJ L 239, 24.9.2018, pp. 8-13)\nDirective 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, pp. 32-46)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2003/87/EC have been incorporated in the original text.
