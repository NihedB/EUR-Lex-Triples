The primary purpose of the Certificate is to declare the airworthiness of maintenance work undertaken on products, parts and appliances (hereafter referred to as ‘item(s)’).\n1.2.   Correlation must be established between the Certificate and the item(s). The originator must retain a Certificate in a form that allows verification of the original data.\n1.3.   The Certificate is acceptable to many airworthiness authorities, but may be dependent on the existence of bilateral agreements and/or the policy of the airworthiness authority. The ‘approved design data’ mentioned in this Certificate then means approved by the airworthiness authority of the importing country.\n1.4.   The Certificate is not a delivery or shipping note.\n1.5.   Aircraft are not to be released using the Certificate.\n1.6.   The Certificate does not constitute approval to install the item on a particular aircraft, engine, or propeller but helps the end user determine its airworthiness approval status.\n1.7.   A mixture of production released and maintenance released items is not permitted on the same Certificate.\n2.   GENERAL FORMAT\n2.1.   The Certificate must comply with the format attached including block numbers and the location of each block. The size of each block may however be varied to suit the individual application, but not to the extent that would make the Certificate unrecognisable.\n2.2.   The Certificate must be in ‘landscape’ format but the overall size may be significantly increased or decreased so long as the Certificate remains recognisable and legible. If in doubt consult the Competent Authority.\n2.3.   The User/Installer responsibility statement can be placed on either side of the form.\n2.4.   All printing must be clear and legible to permit easy reading.\n2.5.   The Certificate may either be pre-printed or computer generated but in either case the printing of lines and characters must be clear and legible and in accordance with the defined format.\n2.6.   The Certificate should be in English, and if appropriate, in one or more other languages.\n2.7.   The details to be entered on the Certificate may be either machine/computer printed or hand-written using block letters and must permit easy reading.\n2.8.   Limit the use of abbreviations to a minimum, to aid clarity.\n2.9.   The space remaining on the reverse side of the Certificate may be used by the originator for any additional information but must not include any certification statement. Any use of the reverse side of the Certificate must be referenced in the appropriate block on the front side of the Certificate\n3.   COPIES\n3.1.   There is no restriction in the number of copies of the Certificate sent to the customer or retained by the originator.\n4.   ERROR(S) ON A CERTIFICATE\n4.1.   If an end-user finds an error(s) on a Certificate, he must identify it/them in writing to the originator. The originator may issue a new Certificate only if the error(s) can be verified and corrected.\n4.2.   The new Certificate must have a new tracking number, signature and date.\n4.3.   The request for a new Certificate may be honoured without re-verification of the item(s) condition. The new Certificate is not a statement of current condition and should refer to the previous Certificate in block 12 by the following statement; ‘This Certificate corrects the error(s) in block(s) [enter block(s) corrected] of the Certificate [enter original tracking number] dated [enter original issuance date] and does not cover conformity/condition/release to service’.

An organisation must be granted an approval ranging from a single class and rating with limitations to all classes and ratings with limitations.\n2.\nIn addition to the table referred to in point 13, the approved maintenance organisation is required to indicate its scope of work in its maintenance organisation manual/exposition. See also point 11.\n3.\nWithin the approval class(es) and rating(s) granted by the competent authority, the scope of work specified in the maintenance organisation exposition defines the exact limits of approval. It is therefore essential that the approval class(es) and rating(s) and the organisations scope of work are matching.\n4.\nA category A class rating means that the approved maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance on the aircraft and any component (including engines and/or Auxiliary Power Units (APUs), in accordance with aircraft maintenance data or, if agreed by the competent authority, in accordance with component maintenance data, only whilst such components are fitted to the aircraft. Nevertheless, such A-rated approved maintenance organisation may temporarily remove a component for maintenance, in order to improve access to that component, except when such removal generates the need for additional maintenance not eligible for the provisions of this point. This will be subject to a control procedure in the maintenance organisation exposition to be approved by the competent authority. The limitation section will specify the scope of such maintenance thereby indicating the extent of approval.\n5.\nA category B class rating means that the approved maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance on the uninstalled engine and/or APU and engine and/or APU components, in accordance with engine and/or APU maintenance data or, if agreed by the competent authority, in accordance with component maintenance data, only whilst such components are fitted to the engine and/or APU. Nevertheless, such B-rated approved maintenance organisation may temporarily remove a component for maintenance, in order to improve access to that component, except when such removal generates the need for additional maintenance not eligible for the provisions of this point. The limitation section will specify the scope of such maintenance thereby indicating the extent of approval. A maintenance organisation approved with a category B class rating may also carry out maintenance on an installed engine during ‘base’ and ‘line’ maintenance subject to a control procedure in the maintenance organisation exposition to be approved by the competent authority. The maintenance organisation exposition scope of work shall reflect such activity where permitted by the competent authority.\n6.\nA category C class rating means that the approved maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance on uninstalled components (excluding engines and APUs) intended for fitment to the aircraft or engine/APU. The limitation section will specify the scope of such maintenance thereby indicating the extent of approval. A maintenance organisation approved with a category C class rating may also carry out maintenance on an installed component during base and line maintenance or at an engine/APU maintenance facility subject to a control procedure in the maintenance organisation exposition to be approved by the competent authority. The maintenance organisation exposition scope of work shall reflect such activity where permitted by the competent authority.\n7.\nA category D class rating is a self contained class rating not necessarily related to a specific aircraft, engine or other component. The D1 — Non Destructive Testing (NDT) rating is only necessary for an approved maintenance organisation that carries out NDT as a particular task for another organisation. A maintenance organisation approved with a class rating in A or B or C category may carry out NDT on products it is maintaining subject to the maintenance organisation exposition containing NDT procedures, without the need for a D1 class rating.\n8.\nIn the case of maintenance organisations approved in accordance with Annex II (Part-145), category A class ratings are subdivided into ‘Base’ or ‘Line’ maintenance. Such an organisation may be approved for either ‘Base’ or ‘Line’ maintenance or both. It should be noted that a ‘Line’ facility located at a main base facility requires a ‘Line’ maintenance approval.\n9.\nThe limitation section is intended to give the competent authorities the flexibility to customise the approval to any particular organisation. Ratings shall be mentioned on the approval only when appropriately limited. The table referred to in point 13 specifies the types of limitation possible. Whilst maintenance is listed last in each class rating it is acceptable to stress the maintenance task rather than the aircraft or engine type or manufacturer, if this is more appropriate to the organisation (an example could be avionic systems installations and related maintenance). Such mention in the limitation section indicates that the maintenance organisation is approved to carry out maintenance up to and including this particular type/task.\n10.\nWhen reference is made to series, type and group in the limitation section of class A and B, series means a specific type series such as Airbus 300 or 310 or 319 or Boeing 737-300 series or RB211-524 series or Cessna 150 or Cessna 172 or Beech 55 series or continental O-200 series etc; type means a specific type or model such as Airbus 310-240 type or RB 211-524 B4 type or Cessna 172RG type; any number of series or types may be quoted; group means for example Cessna single piston engine aircraft or Lycoming non-supercharged piston engines etc.\n11.\nWhen a lengthy capability list is used which could be subject to frequent amendment, then such amendment may be in accordance with the indirect approval procedure referred to in points M.A.604(c) and M.B.606(c) or 145.A.70(c) and 145.B.40, as applicable.\n12.\nA maintenance organisation which employs only one person to both plan and carry out all maintenance can only hold a limited scope of approval rating. The maximum permissible limits are:\nCLASS\nRATING\nLIMITATION\nCLASS AIRCRAFT\nRATING A2 AEROPLANES 5 700 KG AND BELOW\nPISTON ENGINE 5 700 KG AND BELOW\nCLASS AIRCRAFT\nRATING A3 HELICOPTERS\nSINGLE PISTON ENGINE 3 175 KG AND BELOW\nCLASS AIRCRAFT\nRATING A4 AIRCRAFT OTHER THAN A1, A2 AND A3\nNO LIMITATION\nCLASS ENGINES\nRATING B2 PISTON\nLESS THAN 450 HP\nCLASS COMPONENTS RATING OTHER THAN COMPLETE ENGINES OR APU'S.\nC1 TO C22\nAS PER CAPABILITY LIST\nCLASS SPECIALISED\nD1 NDT\nNDT METHOD(S) TO BE SPECIFIED.\nIt should be noted that such an organisation may be further limited by the competent authority in the scope of approval dependent upon the capability of the particular organisation.\n13.\nTable\nCLASS\nRATING\nLIMITATION\nBASE\nLINE\nAIRCRAFT\nA1\nAeroplanes above 5 700 kg\n[Rating reserved to Maintenance Organisations approved in accordance with Annex II (Part-145)]\n[Shall state aeroplane manufacturer or group or series or type and/or the maintenance tasks]\nExample: Airbus A320 Series\n[YES/NO]*\n[YES/NO]*\nA2\nAeroplanes 5 700 kg and below\n[Shall state aeroplane manufacturer or group or series or type and/or the maintenance tasks]\nExample: DHC-6 Twin Otter Series\n[YES/NO]*\n[YES/NO]*\nA3\nHelicopters\n[Shall state helicopter manufacturer or group or series or type and/or the maintenance task(s)]\nExample: Robinson R44\n[YES/NO]*\n[YES/NO]*\nA4\nAircraft other than A1, A2 and A3\n[Shall state aircraft series or type and/or the maintenance task(s).]\n[YES/NO]*\n[YES/NO]*\nENGINES\nB1\nTurbine\n[Shall state engine series or type and/or the maintenance task(s)]\nExample: PT6A Series\nB2\nPiston\n[Shall state engine manufacturer or group or series or type and/or the maintenance task(s)]\nB3\nAPU\n[Shall state engine manufacturer or series or type and/or the maintenance task(s)]\nCOMPONENTS OTHER THAN COMPLETE ENGINES OR APUs\nC1\nAir Cond & Press\n[Shall state aircraft type or aircraft manufacturer or component manufacturer or the particular component and/or cross refer to a capability list in the exposition and/or the maintenance task(s).]\nExample: PT6A Fuel Control\nC2\nAuto Flight\nC3\nComms and Nav\nC4\nDoors — Hatches\nC5\nElectrical Power & Lights\nC6\nEquipment\nC7\nEngine — APU\nC8\nFlight Controls\nC9\nFuel\nC10\nHelicopter — Rotors\nC11\nHelicopter — Trans\nC12\nHydraulic Power\nC13\nIndicating — recording system\nC14\nLanding Gear\nC15\nOxygen\nC16\nPropellers\nC17\nPneumatic & Vacuum\nC18\nProtection ice/rain/fire\nC19\nWindows\nC20\nStructural\nC21\nWater ballast\nC22\nPropulsion Augmentation\nSPECIALISED SERVICES\nD1\nNon Destructive Testing\n[Shall state particular NDT method(s)]\nAppendix V\nMaintenance Organisation Approval referred to in Annex I (Part-M) Subpart F\nAppendix VI\nContinuing Airworthiness Management Organisation Approval referred to in Annex I (Part-M) Subpart G\nAppendix VII\nComplex Maintenance Tasks\nThe following constitutes the complex maintenance tasks referred to in points M.A.502(d)3, M.A.801(b)2 and M.A.801(c):\n1.\nThe modification, repair or replacement by riveting, bonding, laminating, or welding of any of the following airframe parts:\n(a)\na box beam;\n(b)\na wing stringer or chord member;\n(c)\na spar;\n(d)\na spar flange;\n(e)\na member of a truss-type beam;\n(f)\nthe web of a beam;\n(g)\na keel or chine member of a flying boat hull or a float;\n(h)\na corrugated sheet compression member in a wing or tail surface;\n(i)\na wing main rib;\n(j)\na wing or tail surface brace strut;\n(k)\nan engine mount;\n(l)\na fuselage longeron or frame;\n(m)\na member of a side truss, horizontal truss or bulkhead;\n(n)\na seat support brace or bracket;\n(o)\na seat rail replacement;\n(p)\na landing gear strut or brace strut;\n(q)\nan axle;\n(r)\na wheel;

and\n(d)\nany other structure, not listed in (1), that a manufacturer has identified as primary structure in its maintenance manual, structural repair manual or instructions for continuing airworthiness.\n3.\nThe performance of the following maintenance on a piston engine:\n(a)\ndismantling and subsequent reassembling of a piston engine other than (i) to obtain access to the piston/cylinder assemblies; or (ii) to remove the rear accessory cover to inspect and/or replace oil pump assemblies, where such work does not involve the removal and re-fitment of internal gears;\n(b)\ndismantling and subsequent reassembling of reduction gears;\n(c)\nwelding and brazing of joints, other than minor weld repairs to exhaust units carried out by a suitably approved or authorised welder but excluding component replacement;\n(d)\nthe disturbing of individual parts of units which are supplied as bench tested units, except for the replacement or adjustment of items normally replaceable or adjustable in service.\n4.\nThe balancing of a propeller, except:\n(a)\nfor the certification of static balancing where required by the maintenance manual;\n(b)\ndynamic balancing on installed propellers using electronic balancing equipment where permitted by the maintenance manual or other approved airworthiness data;\n5.\nAny additional task that requires:\n(a)\nspecialized tooling, equipment or facilities; or\n(b)\nsignificant coordination procedures because of the extensive duration of the tasks and the involvement of several persons.\nAppendix VIII\nlimited Pilot-owner maintenance\nIn addition to the requirements laid down in Annex I (Part-M), the following basic principles are to be complied with before any maintenance task is carried out under the terms of Pilot-owner maintenance:\n(a)\nCompetence and responsibility\n1.\nThe Pilot-owner is always responsible for any maintenance that he performs.\n2.\nBefore carrying out any Pilot-owner maintenance tasks, the Pilot-owner must satisfy himself that he is competent to do the task. It is the responsibility of Pilot-owners to familiarize themselves with the standard maintenance practices for their aircraft and with the aircraft maintenance programme. If the Pilot-owner is not competent for the task to be carried out, the task cannot be released by the Pilot-owner.\n3.\nThe Pilot-owner (or his contracted continuing airworthiness management organisation referred to in Subpart G, Section A of this Annex) is responsible for identifying the Pilot-owner tasks according to these basic principles in the maintenance programme and for ensuring that the document is updated in a timely manner.\n4.\nThe approval of the maintenance programme has to be carried out in accordance with point M.A.302.\n(b)\nTasks\nThe Pilot-owner may carry out simple visual inspections or operations to check for general condition and obvious damage and normal operation of the airframe, engines, systems and components.\nMaintenance tasks shall not be carried out by the Pilot-owner when the task:\n1.\nis critically safety related, whose incorrect performance will drastically affect the airworthiness of the aircraft or is a flight safety sensitive maintenance task as specified in point M.A.402(a) and/or;\n2.\nrequires the removal of major components or major assembly and/or;\n3.\nis carried out in compliance with an Airworthiness Directive or an Airworthiness Limitation Item, unless specifically allowed in the AD or the ALI and/or;\n4.\nrequires the use of special tools, calibrated tools (except torque wrench and crimping tool) and/or;\n5.\nrequires the use of test equipments or special testing (e.g. NDT, system tests or operational checks for avionic equipment) and/or;\n6.\nis composed of any unscheduled special inspections (e.g. heavy landing check) and/or;\n7.\nis effecting systems essential for the IFR operations and/or;\n8.\nis listed in Appendix VII to this Annex or is a component maintenance task in accordance with points M.A.502(a), (b), (c) or (d).\nThe criteria 1 to 8 listed above can not be overridden by less restrictive instructions issued in accordance with ‘M.A.302(d) Maintenance Programme’.\nAny task described in the aircraft flight manual as preparing the aircraft for flight (Example: assembling the glider wings or pre-flight), is considered to be a pilot task and is not considered a Pilot-owner maintenance task and therefore does not require a Certificate of Release to Service.\n(c)\nPerformance of the maintenance Pilot-owner tasks and records\nThe maintenance data as specified in point M.A.401 must be always available during the conduct of Pilot-owner maintenance and must be complied with. Details of the data referred to in the conduct of Pilot-owner maintenance must be included in the Certificate of Release to Service in accordance with point M.A.803(d).\nThe Pilot-owner must inform the approved continuing airworthiness management organisation responsible for the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft (if applicable) not later than 30 days after completion of the Pilot-owner maintenance task in accordance with point M.A.305(a).\nANNEX II\n(Part-145)\nCONTENTS\n145.1   General\nSECTION A —\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n145.A.10\nScope\n145.A.15\nApplication\n145.A.20\nTerms of approval\n145.A.25\nFacility requirements\n145.A.30\nPersonnel requirements\n145.A.35\nCertifying staff and support staff\n145.A.40\nEquipment, tools and material\n145.A.42\nAcceptance of components\n145.A.45\nMaintenance data\n145.A.47\nProduction planning\n145.A.50\nCertification of maintenance\n145.A.55\nMaintenance records\n145.A.60\nOccurrence reporting\n145.A.65\nSafety and quality policy, maintenance procedures and quality system\n145.A.70\nMaintenance organisation exposition\n145.A.75\nPrivileges of the organisation\n145.A.80\nLimitations on the organisation\n145.A.85\nChanges to the organisation\n145.A.90\nContinued validity\n145.A.95\nFindings\nSECTION B —\nPROCEDURES FOR COMPETENT AUTHORITIES\n145.B.1\nScope\n145.B.10\nCompetent authority\n145.B.15\nOrganisations located in several Member States\n145.B.20\nInitial approval\n145.B.25\nIssue of approval\n145.B.30\nContinuation of an approval\n145.B.35\nChanges\n145.B.40\nChanges to the Maintenance Organisation Exposition\n145.B.45\nRevocation, suspension and limitation of approval\n145.B.50\nFindings\n145.B.55\nRecord-keeping\n145.B.60\nExemptions\nAppendix I —\nAuthorised Release Certificate EASA Form 1\nAppendix II —\nClass and Ratings System used for the Approval of Maintenance Organisations referred to in Annex I (Part-M) Subpart F and in Annex II (Part-145)\nAppendix III —\nMaintenance Organisation Approval referred to in Annex II (Part-145)\nAppendix IV —\nConditions for the use of staff not qualified in accordance with Annex III (Part-66) referred to in points 145.A.30(j) 1 and 2\n145.1   General\nFor the purpose of this Part, the competent authority shall be:\n1.\nfor organisations having their principal place of business in a Member State, the authority designated by that Member State, or;\n2.\nfor organisations having their principal place of business located in a third country, the Agency.\nSECTION A\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n145.A.10   Scope\nThis Section establishes the requirements to be met by an organisation to qualify for the issue or continuation of an approval for the maintenance of aircraft and components.\n145.A.15   Application\nAn application for the issue or change of an approval shall be made to the competent authority in a form and manner established by such authority.\n145.A.20   Terms of Approval\nThe organisation shall specify the scope of work deemed to constitute approval in its exposition (Appendix IV to Annex I (Part-M) contains a table of all classes and ratings).\n145.A.25   Facility requirements\nThe organisation shall ensure that:\n(a)\nFacilities are provided appropriate for all planned work, ensuring in particular, protection from the weather elements. Specialised workshops and bays are segregated as appropriate, to ensure that environmental and work area contamination is unlikely to occur.\n1.\nFor base maintenance of aircraft, aircraft hangars are both available and large enough to accommodate aircraft on planned base maintenance;\n2.\nFor component maintenance, component workshops are large enough to accommodate the components on planned maintenance.\n(b)\nOffice accommodation is provided for the management of the planned work referred to in point (a), and certifying staff so that they can carry out their designated tasks in a manner that contributes to good aircraft maintenance standards.\n(c)\nThe working environment including aircraft hangars, component workshops and office accommodation is appropriate for the task carried out and in particular special requirements observed. Unless otherwise dictated by the particular task environment, the working environment must be such that the effectiveness of personnel is not impaired:\n1.\ntemperatures must be maintained such that personnel can carry out required tasks without undue discomfort.\n2.\ndust and any other airborne contamination are kept to a minimum and not be permitted to reach a level in the work task area where visible aircraft/component surface contamination is evident. Where dust/other airborne contamination results in visible surface contamination, all susceptible systems are sealed until acceptable conditions are re-established.\n3.\nlighting is such as to ensure each inspection and maintenance task can be carried out in an effective manner.\n4.\nnoise shall not distract personnel from carrying out inspection tasks. Where it is impractical to control the noise source, such personnel are provided with the necessary personal equipment to stop excessive noise causing distraction during inspection tasks.\n5.\nwhere a particular maintenance task requires the application of specific environmental conditions different to the foregoing, then such conditions are observed. Specific conditions are identified in the maintenance data.\n6.\nthe working environment for line maintenance is such that the particular maintenance or inspection task can be carried out without undue distraction. Therefore where the working environment deteriorates to an unacceptable level in respect of temperature, moisture, hail, ice, snow, wind, light, dust/other airborne contamination, the particular maintenance or inspection tasks must be suspended until satisfactory conditions are re-established.\n(d)\nSecure storage facilities are provided for components, equipment, tools and material. Storage conditions ensure segregation of serviceable components and material from unserviceable aircraft components, material, equipment and tools. The conditions of storage are in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to prevent deterioration and damage of stored items. Access to storage facilities is restricted to authorised personnel.\n145.A.30   Personnel requirements\n(a)\nThe organisation shall appoint an accountable manager who has corporate authority for ensuring that all maintenance required by the customer can be financed and carried out to the standard required by this Part. The accountable manager shall:\n1.\nensure that all necessary resources are available to accomplish maintenance in accordance with point 145.A.65(b) to support the organisation approval.\n2.\nestablish and promote the safety and quality policy specified in point 145.A.65(a).\n3.\ndemonstrate a basic understanding of this Annex (Part-145).\n(b)\nThe organisation shall nominate a person or group of persons, whose responsibilities include ensuring that the organisation complies with this Part. Such person(s) shall ultimately be responsible to the accountable manager.\n1.\nThe person or persons nominated shall represent the maintenance management structure of the organisation and be responsible for all functions specified in this Part.\n2.\nThe person or persons nominated shall be identified and their credentials submitted in a form and manner established by the competent authority.\n3.\nThe person or persons nominated shall be able to demonstrate relevant knowledge, background and satisfactory experience related to aircraft or component maintenance and demonstrate a working knowledge of this Part.\n4.\nProcedures shall make clear who deputises for any particular person in the case of lengthy absence of the said person.\n(c)\nThe accountable manager under point (a) shall appoint a person with responsibility for monitoring the quality system, including the associated feedback system as required by point 145.A.65(c). The appointed person shall have direct access to the accountable manager to ensure that the accountable manager is kept properly informed on quality and compliance matters.\n(d)\nThe organisation shall have a maintenance man-hour plan showing that the organisation has sufficient staff to plan, perform, supervise, inspect and quality monitor the organisation in accordance with the approval. In addition the organisation shall have a procedure to reassess work intended to be carried out when actual staff availability is less than the planned staffing level for any particular work shift or period.\n(e)\nThe organisation shall establish and control the competence of personnel involved in any maintenance, management and/or quality audits in accordance with a procedure and to a standard agreed by the competent authority. In addition to the necessary expertise related to the job function, competence must include an understanding of the application of human factors and human performance issues appropriate to that person's function in the organisation. ‘Human factors’ means principles which apply to aeronautical design, certification, training, operations and maintenance and which seek safe interface between the human and other system components by proper consideration of human performance. ‘Human performance’ means human capabilities and limitations which have an impact on the safety and efficiency of aeronautical operations.\n(f)\nThe organisation shall ensure that personnel who carry out and/or control a continued airworthiness non-destructive test of aircraft structures and/or components are appropriately qualified for the particular non-destructive test in accordance with the European or equivalent Standard recognised by the Agency.

General\nAircraft type training shall consist of theoretical training and examination, and, except for the category C ratings, practical training and assessment.\n(a)\nTheoretical training and examination shall comply with the following requirements:\n(i)\nShall be conducted by a maintenance training organisation appropriately approved in accordance with Annex IV (Part-147) or, when conducted by other organisations, as directly approved by the competent authority.\n(ii)\nShall comply, except as permitted by the differences training described in point (c), with:\nthe relevant elements defined in the mandatory part of the operational suitability data established in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 or, if such elements are not available, the standard described in point 3.1 of this Appendix, and\nthe type training examination standard described in point 4.1 of this Appendix.\n(iii)\nIn the case of a category C person qualified by holding an academic degree as specified in point 66.A.30(a)(5), the first relevant aircraft type theoretical training shall be at the category B1 or B2 level.\n(iv)\nShall have been started and completed within the 3 years preceding the application for a type rating endorsement.\n(b)\nPractical training and assessment shall comply with the following requirements:\n(i)\nShall be conducted by a maintenance training organisation appropriately approved in accordance with Annex IV (Part-147) or, when conducted by other organisations, as directly approved by the competent authority.\n(ii)\nShall comply, except as permitted by the differences training described in point (c), with:\nthe relevant elements defined in the mandatory part of the operational suitability data established in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 or, if such elements are not available, the standard described in point 3.2 of this Appendix, and\nthe type training assessment standard described in point 4.2 of this Appendix.\n(iii)\nShall include a representative cross section of maintenance activities relevant to the aircraft type.\n(iv)\nShall include demonstrations using equipment, components, simulators, other training devices or aircraft.\n(v)\nShall have been started and completed within the 3 years preceding the application for a type rating endorsement.\n(c)\nDifferences training\n(i)\nDifferences training is the training required in order to cover the differences between two different aircraft type ratings of the same manufacturer as determined by the Agency.\n(ii)\nDifferences training has to be defined on a case-to-case basis taking into account the requirements contained in this Appendix III in respect of both theoretical and practical elements of type rating training.\n(iii)\nA type rating shall only be endorsed on a licence after differences training when the applicant also complies with one of the following conditions:\n—\nhaving already endorsed on the licence the aircraft type rating from which the differences are being identified, or\n—\nhaving completed the type training requirements for the aircraft from which the differences are being identified.\n2.   Aircraft type training levels\nThe three levels listed below define the objectives, the depth of training and the level of knowledge that the training is intended to achieve.\n—\nLevel 1: A brief overview of the airframe, systems and powerplant as outlined in the Systems Description Section of the Aircraft Maintenance Manual/Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\nCourse objectives: Upon completion of Level 1 training, the student will be able to:\n(a)\nprovide a simple description of the whole subject, using common words and examples, using typical terms and identify safety precautions related to the airframe, its systems and powerplant;\n(b)\nidentify aircraft manuals, maintenance practices important to the airframe, its systems and powerplant;\n(c)\ndefine the general layout of the aircraft's major systems;\n(d)\ndefine the general layout and characteristics of the powerplant;\n(e)\nidentify special tooling and test equipment used with the aircraft.\n—\nLevel 2: Basic system overview of controls, indicators, principal components, including their location and purpose, servicing and minor troubleshooting. General knowledge of the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.\nCourse objectives: In addition to the information contained in the Level 1 training, at the completion of Level 2 training, the student will be able to:\n(a)\nunderstand the theoretical fundamentals; apply knowledge in a practical manner using detailed procedures;\n(b)\nrecall the safety precautions to be observed when working on or near the aircraft, powerplant and systems;\n(c)\ndescribe systems and aircraft handling particularly access, power availability and sources;\n(d)\nidentify the locations of the principal components;\n(e)\nexplain the normal functioning of each major system, including terminology and nomenclature;\n(f)\nperform the procedures for servicing associated with the aircraft for the following systems: Fuel, Power Plants, Hydraulics, Landing Gear, Water/Waste, and Oxygen;\n(g)\ndemonstrate proficiency in use of crew reports and on-board reporting systems (minor troubleshooting) and determine aircraft airworthiness per the MEL/CDL;\n(h)\ndemonstrate the use, interpretation and application of appropriate documentation including instructions for continued airworthiness, maintenance manual, illustrated parts catalogue, etc.\n—\nLevel 3: Detailed description, operation, component location, removal/installation and bite and troubleshooting procedures to maintenance manual level.\nCourse objectives: In addition to the information contained in Level 1 and Level 2 training, at the completion of Level 3 training, the student will be able to:\n(a)\ndemonstrate a theoretical knowledge of aircraft systems and structures and interrelationships with other systems, provide a detailed description of the subject using theoretical fundamentals and specific examples and to interpret results from various sources and measurements and apply corrective action where appropriate;\n(b)\nperform system, powerplant, component and functional checks as specified in the aircraft maintenance manual;\n(c)\ndemonstrate the use, interpret and apply appropriate documentation including structural repair manual, troubleshooting manual, etc.;\n(d)\ncorrelate information for the purpose of making decisions in respect of fault diagnosis and rectification to maintenance manual level;\n(e)\ndescribe procedures for replacement of components unique to aircraft type.\n3.   Aircraft type training standard\nAlthough aircraft type training includes both theoretical and practical elements, courses can be approved for the theoretical element, the practical element or for a combination of both.\n3.1.   Theoretical element\n(a)\nObjective:\nOn completion of a theoretical training course the student shall be able to demonstrate, to the levels identified in the Appendix III syllabus, the detailed theoretical knowledge of the aircraft's applicable systems, structure, operations, maintenance, repair, and troubleshooting according to approved maintenance data. The student shall be able to demonstrate the use of manuals and approved procedures, including the knowledge of relevant inspections and limitations.\n(b)\nLevel of training:\nTraining levels are those levels defined in point 2 above.\nAfter the first type course for category C certifying staff all subsequent courses need only be to level 1.\nDuring a level 3 theoretical training, level 1 and 2 training material may be used to teach the full scope of the chapter if required. However, during the training the majority of the course material and training time shall be at the higher level.\n(c)\nDuration:\nThe theoretical training minimum tuition hours are contained in the following table:\nCategory\nHours\nAeroplanes with a maximum take-off mass above 30 000 kg:\nB1.1\n150\nB1.2\n120\nB2\n100\nC\n30\nAeroplanes with a maximum take-off mass equal or less than 30 000 kg and above 5 700 kg:\nB1.1\n120\nB1.2\n100\nB2\n100\nC\n25\nAeroplanes with a maximum take-off mass of 5 700 kg and below\n (1)\nB1.1\n80\nB1.2\n60\nB2\n60\nC\n15\nHelicopters\n (2)\nB1.3\n120\nB1.4\n100\nB2\n100\nC\n25\nFor the purpose of the table above, a tuition hour means 60 minutes of teaching and exclude any breaks, examination, revision, preparation and aircraft visit.\nThese hours apply only to theoretical courses for complete aircraft/engine combinations according to the type rating as defined by the Agency.\n(d)\nJustification of course duration:\nTraining courses carried out in a maintenance training organisation approved in accordance with Annex IV (Part-147) and courses directly approved by the competent authority shall justify their hour duration and the coverage of the full syllabus by a training needs analysis based on:\n—\nthe design of the aircraft type, its maintenance needs and the types of operation,\n—\ndetailed analysis of applicable chapters — see contents table in point 3.1(e) below,\n—\ndetailed competency analysis showing that the objectives as stated in point 3.1(a) above are fully met.\nWhere the training needs analysis shows that more hours are needed, course lengths shall be longer than the minimum specified in the table.\nSimilarly, tuition hours of differences courses or other training course combinations (such as combined B1/B2 courses), and in cases of theoretical type training courses below the figures given in point 3.1(c) above, these shall be justified to the competent authority by the training needs analysis as described above.\nIn addition, the course must describe and justify the following:\n—\nThe minimum attendance required to the trainee, in order to meet the objectives of the course.\n—\nThe maximum number of hours of training per day, taking into account pedagogical and human factors principles.\nIf the minimum attendance required is not met, the certificate of recognition shall not be issued. Additional training may be provided by the training organisation in order to meet the minimum attendance time.\n(e)\nContent:\nAs a minimum, the elements in the Syllabus below that are specific to the aircraft type shall be covered. Additional elements introduced due to type variations, technological changes, etc. shall also be included.\nThe training syllabus shall be focused on mechanical and electrical aspects for B1 personnel, and electrical and avionic aspects for B2.\nLevel\nChapters\nAeroplanes turbine\nAeroplanes piston\nHelicopters turbine\nHelicopters piston\nAvionics\nLicence category.\nB1\nC\nB1\nC\nB1\nC\nB1\nC\nB2\nIntroduction module:\n05\nTime limits/maintenance checks\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n06\nDimensions/Areas (MTOM, etc.)\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n07\nLifting and Shoring\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n08\nLevelling and weighing\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n09\nTowing and taxiing\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n10\nParking/mooring, Storing and Return to Service\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n11\nPlacards and Markings\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n12\nServicing\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n20\nStandard practices — only type particular\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nHelicopters\n18\nVibration and Noise Analysis (Blade tracking)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n60\nStandard Practices Rotor\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n62\nRotors\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n62A\nRotors — Monitoring and indicating\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n63\nRotor Drives\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n63A\nRotor Drives — Monitoring and indicating\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n64\nTail Rotor\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n64A\nTail rotor — Monitoring and indicating\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n65\nTail Rotor Drive\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n65A\nTail Rotor Drive — Monitoring and indicating\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n66\nFolding Blades/Pylon\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n67\nRotors Flight Control\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n53\nAirframe Structure (Helicopter)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n25\nEmergency Flotation Equipment\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n1\n3\n1\n1\nAirframe structures\n51\nStandard practices and structures (damage classification, assessment and repair)\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n53\nFuselage\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n54\nNacelles/Pylons\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n55\nStabilisers\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n56\nWindows\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n57\nWings\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n27A\nFlight Control Surfaces (All)\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n52\nDoors\n3\n1\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\nZonal and Station Identification Systems.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nAirframe systems:\n21\nAir Conditioning\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n21A\nAir Supply\n3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n3\n3\n1\n2\n21B\nPressurisation\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n21C\nSafety and Warning Devices\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n22\nAutoflight\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n3\n23\nCommunications\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n3\n24\nElectrical Power\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n25\nEquipment and Furnishings\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n25A\nElectronic Equipment including emergency equipment\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n3\n26\nFire Protection\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n27\nFlight Controls\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n2\n27A\nSys.

Practical element\n(a)\nObjective:\nThe objective of practical training is to gain the required competence in performing safe maintenance, inspections and routine work according to the maintenance manual and other relevant instructions and tasks as appropriate for the type of aircraft, for example troubleshooting, repairs, adjustments, replacements, rigging and functional checks. It includes the awareness of the use of all technical literature and documentation for the aircraft, the use of specialist/special tooling and test equipment for performing removal and replacement of components and modules unique to type, including any on-wing maintenance activity.\n(b)\nContent:\nAt least 50 % of the crossed items in the table below, which are relevant to the particular aircraft type, shall be completed as part of the practical training.\nTasks crossed represent subjects that are important for practical training purposes to ensure that the operation, function, installation and safety significance of key maintenance tasks is adequately addressed; particularly where these cannot be fully explained by theoretical training alone. Although the list details the minimum practical training subjects, other items may be added where applicable to the particular aircraft type.\nTasks to be completed shall be representative of the aircraft and systems both in complexity and in the technical input required to complete that task. While relatively simple tasks may be included, other more complex tasks shall also be incorporated and undertaken as appropriate to the aircraft type.\nGlossary of the table: LOC: Location; FOT: Functional/Operational Test; SGH: Service and Ground Handling; R/I: Removal/Installation; MEL: Minimum Equipment List; TS: TroubleShooting.\nChapters\nB1/B2\nB1\nB2\nLOC\nFOT\nSGH\nR/I\nMEL\nTS\nFOT\nSGH\nR/I\nMEL\nTS\nIntroduction module:\n5\nTime limits/maintenance checks\nX/X\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n6\nDimensions/Areas (MTOM, etc.)\nX/X\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n7\nLifting and Shoring\nX/X\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n8\nLevelling and weighing\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n9\nTowing and taxiing\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n10\nParking/mooring, Storing and Return to Service\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n11\nPlacards and Markings\nX/X\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n12\nServicing\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n20\nStandard practices — only type particular\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\nHelicopters:\n18\nVibration and Noise Analysis (Blade tracking)\nX/—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n60\nStandard Practices Rotor — only type specific\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n62\nRotors\nX/—\n—\nX\nX\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n62A\nRotors — Monitoring and indicating\nX/X\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\n—\nX\n63\nRotor Drives\nX/—\nX\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n63A\nRotor Drives — Monitoring and indicating\nX/X\nX\n—\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\n—\nX\n64\nTail Rotor\nX/—\n—\nX\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n64A\nTail rotor -Monitoring and indicating\nX/X\nX\n—\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\n—\nX\n65\nTail Rotor Drive\nX/—\nX\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n65A\nTail Rotor Drive — Monitoring and indicating\nX/X\nX\n—\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\n—\nX\n66\nFolding Blades/Pylon\nX/—\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n67\nRotors Flight Control\nX/—\nX\nX\n—\nX\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n53\nAirframe Structure (Helicopter)\nNote: covered under Airframe structures\n25\nEmergency Flotation Equipment\nX/X\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\n—\nAirframe structures:\n51\nStandard Practices and Structures (damage classification, assessment and repair)\n53\nFuselage\nX/—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n54\nNacelles/Pylons\nX/—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n55\nStabilisers\nX/—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n56\nWindows\nX/—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n57\nWings\nX/—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n27A\nFlight Control Surfaces\nX/—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n52\nDoors\nX/X\nX\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\nAirframe systems:\n21\nAir Conditioning\nX/X\nX\nX\n—\nX\nX\nX\nX\n—\nX\nX\n21A\nAir Supply\nX/X\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n21B\nPressurisation\nX/X\nX\n—\n—\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\nX\n21C\nSafety and warning Devices\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\n—\n—\n22\nAutoflight\nX/X\n—\n—\n—\nX\n—\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n23\nCommunications\nX/X\n—\nX\n—\nX\n—\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n24\nElectrical Power\nX/X\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n25\nEquipment and Furnishings\nX/X\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\n25A\nElectronic Equipment including emergency equipment\nX/X\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\n26\nFire Protection\nX/X\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n27\nFlight Controls\nX/X\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n—\n—\n—\n—\n27A\nSys.

Type training examination and assessment standard\n4.1.   Theoretical element examination standard\nAfter the theoretical portion of the aircraft type training has been completed, a written examination shall be performed, which shall comply with the following:\n(a)\nFormat of the examination is of the multi-choice type. Each multi-choice question shall have 3 alternative answers of which only one shall be the correct answer. The total time is based on the total number of questions and the time for answering is based upon a nominal average of 90 seconds per question.\n(b)\nThe incorrect alternatives shall seem equally plausible to anyone ignorant of the subject. All the alternatives shall be clearly related to the question and of similar vocabulary, grammatical construction and length.\n(c)\nIn numerical questions, the incorrect answers shall correspond to procedural errors such as the use of incorrect sense (+ versus -) or incorrect measurement units. They shall not be mere random numbers.\n(d)\nThe level of examination for each chapter (3) shall be the one defined in point 2 ‘Aircraft type training levels’. However, the use of a limited number of questions at a lower level is acceptable.\n(e)\nThe examination shall be of the closed book type. No reference material is permitted. An exception will be made for the case of examining a B1 or B2 candidate's ability to interpret technical documents.\n(f)\nThe number of questions shall be at least 1 question per hour of instruction. The number of questions for each chapter and level shall be proportionate to:\n—\nthe effective training hours spent teaching at that chapter and level,\n—\nthe learning objectives as given by the training needs analysis.\nThe competent authority of the Member State will assess the number and the level of the questions when approving the course.\n(g)\nThe minimum examination pass mark is 75 %. When the type training examination is split in several examinations, each examination shall be passed with at least a 75 % mark. In order to be possible to achieve exactly a 75 % pass mark, the number of questions in the examination shall be a multiple of 4.\n(h)\nPenalty marking (negative points for failed questions) is not to be used.\n(i)\nEnd of module phase examinations cannot be used as part of the final examination unless they contain the correct number and level of questions required.\n4.2.   Practical element assessment standard\nAfter the practical element of the aircraft type training has been completed, an assessment must be performed, which must comply with the following:\n(a)\nThe assessment shall be performed by designated assessors appropriately qualified.\n(b)\nThe assessment shall evaluate the knowledge and skills of the trainee.\n5.   Type examination standard\nType examination shall be conducted by training organisations appropriately approved under Part-147 or by the competent authority.\nThe examination shall be oral, written or practical assessment based, or a combination thereof and it shall comply with the following requirements:\n(a)\nOral examination questions shall be open.\n(b)\nWritten examination questions shall be essay type or multi-choice questions.\n(c)\nPractical assessment shall determine a person's competence to perform a task.\n(d)\nExaminations shall be on a sample of chapters (4) drawn from point 3 type training/examination syllabus, at the indicated level.\n(e)\nThe incorrect alternatives shall seem equally plausible to anyone ignorant of the subject. All of the alternatives shall be clearly related to the question and of similar vocabulary, grammatical construction and length.\n(f)\nIn numerical questions, the incorrect answers shall correspond to procedural errors such as corrections applied in the wrong sense or incorrect unit conversions: they shall not be mere random numbers.\n(g)\nThe examination shall ensure that the following objectives are met:\n1.\nProperly discuss with confidence the aircraft and its systems.\n2.\nEnsure safe performance of maintenance, inspections and routine work according to the maintenance manual and other relevant instructions and tasks as appropriate for the type of aircraft, for example troubleshooting, repairs, adjustments, replacements, rigging and functional checks such as engine run, etc., if required.\n3.\nCorrectly use all technical literature and documentation for the aircraft.\n4.\nCorrectly use specialist/special tooling and test equipment, perform removal and replacement of components and modules unique to type, including any on-wing maintenance activity\n(h)\nThe following conditions apply to the examination:\n1.\nThe maximum number of consecutive attempts is three. Further sets of three attempts are allowed with a 1 year waiting period between sets. A waiting period of 30 days is required after the first failed attempt within one set, and a waiting period of 60 days is required after the second failed attempt.\nThe applicant shall confirm in writing to the maintenance training organisation or the competent authority to which they apply for an examination, the number and dates of attempts during the last year and the maintenance training organisation or the competent authority where these attempts took place. The maintenance training organisation or the competent authority is responsible for checking the number of attempts within the applicable timeframes.\n2.\nThe type examination shall be passed and the required practical experience shall be completed within the 3 years preceding the application for the rating endorsement on the aircraft maintenance licence.\n3.\nType examination shall be performed with at least one examiner present. The examiner(s) shall not have been involved in the applicant's training.\n(i)\nA written and signed report shall be made by the examiner(s) to explain why the candidate has passed or failed.\n6.   On the Job Training\nOn the Job Training (OJT) shall be approved by the competent authority who has issued the licence.\nIt shall be conducted at and under the control of a maintenance organisation appropriately approved for the maintenance of the particular aircraft type and shall be assessed by designated assessors appropriately qualified.\nIt shall have been started and completed within the 3 years preceding the application for a type rating endorsement.\n(a)\nObjective:\nThe objective of OJT is to gain the required competence and experience in performing safe maintenance.\n(b)\nContent:\nOJT shall cover a cross section of tasks acceptable to the competent authority. The OJT tasks to be completed shall be representative of the aircraft and systems both in complexity and in the technical input required to complete that task. While relatively simple tasks may be included, other more complex maintenance tasks shall also be incorporated and undertaken as appropriate to the aircraft type.\nEach task shall be signed off by the student and countersigned by a designated supervisor.
