as relevance and necessity that guide this Agreement and its implementation by the European Union and the United States; and\nHAVING REGARD to the possibility of the Parties to further discuss the transfer of PNR data in the maritime mode;\nHEREBY AGREE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nPurpose\n1.   The purpose of this Agreement is to ensure security and to protect the life and safety of the public.\n2.   For this purpose, this Agreement sets forth the responsibilities of the Parties with respect to the conditions under which PNR may be transferred, processed and used, and protected.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   PNR, as set forth in the Guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, shall mean the record created by air carriers or their authorised agents for each journey booked by or on behalf of any passenger and contained in carriers’ reservation systems, departure control systems, or equivalent systems providing similar functionality (collectively referred to in this Agreement as ‘reservation systems’). Specifically, as used in this Agreement, PNR consists of the data types set forth in the Annex to this Agreement (‘Annex’).\n2.   This Agreement shall apply to carriers operating passenger flights between the European Union and the United States.\n3.   This Agreement shall also apply to carriers incorporated or storing data in the European Union and operating passenger flights to or from the United States.\nArticle 3\nProvision of PNR\nThe Parties agree that carriers shall provide PNR contained in their reservation systems to DHS as required by and in accordance with DHS standards and consistent with this Agreement. Should PNR transferred by carriers include data beyond those listed in the Annex, DHS shall delete such data upon receipt.\nArticle 4\nUse of PNR\n1.   The United States collects, uses and processes PNR for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating, and prosecuting:\n(a)\nTerrorist offences and related crimes, including:\n(i)\nConduct that —\n1.\ninvolves a violent act or an act dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; and\n2.\nappears to be intended to —\na.\nintimidate or coerce a civilian population;\nb.\ninfluence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\nc.\naffect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage-taking;\n(ii)\nActivities constituting an offence within the scope of and as defined in applicable international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism;\n(iii)\nProviding or collecting funds, by any means, directly or indirectly, with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out any of the acts described in subparagraphs (i) or (ii);\n(iv)\nAttempting to commit any of the acts described in subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii);\n(v)\nParticipating as an accomplice in the commission of any of the acts described in subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii);\n(vi)\nOrganising or directing others to commit any of the acts described in subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii);\n(vii)\nContributing in any other way to the commission of any of the acts described in subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii);\n(viii)\nThreatening to commit an act described in subparagraph (i) under circumstances which indicate that the threat is credible;\n(b)\nOther crimes that are punishable by a sentence of imprisonment of three years or more and that are transnational in nature.\nA crime is considered as transnational in nature in particular if:\n(i)\nit is committed in more than one country;\n(ii)\nit is committed in one country but a substantial part of its preparation, planning, direction or control takes place in another country;\n(iii)\nit is committed in one country but involves an organised criminal group that engages in criminal activities in more than one country;\n(iv)\nit is committed in one country but has substantial effects in another country; or\n(v)\nit is committed in one country and the offender is in or intends to travel to another country.\n2.   PNR may be used and processed on a case-by-case basis where necessary in view of a serious threat and for the protection of vital interests of any individual or if ordered by a court.\n3.   PNR may be used and processed by DHS to identify persons who would be subject to closer questioning or examination upon arrival to or departure from the United States or who may require further examination.\n4.   Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 shall be without prejudice to domestic law enforcement, judicial powers, or proceedings, where other violations of law or indications thereof are detected in the course of the use and processing of PNR.\nCHAPTER II\nSAFEGUARDS APPLICABLE TO THE USE OF PNR\nArticle 5\nData security\n1.   DHS shall ensure that appropriate technical measures and organisational arrangements are implemented to protect personal data and personal information contained in PNR against accidental, unlawful or unauthorised destruction, loss, disclosure, alteration, access, processing or use.\n2.   DHS shall make appropriate use of technology to ensure data protection, security, confidentiality and integrity. In particular, DHS shall ensure that:\n(a)\nencryption, authorisation and documentation procedures recognised by competent authorities are applied. In particular, access to PNR shall be secured and limited to specifically authorised officials;\n(b)\nPNR shall be held in a secure physical environment and protected with physical intrusion controls; and\n(c)\na mechanism exists to ensure that PNR queries are conducted consistent with Article 4.\n3.   In the event of a privacy incident (including unauthorised access or disclosure), DHS shall take reasonable measures to notify affected individuals as appropriate, to mitigate the risk of harm of unauthorised disclosures of personal data and information, and to institute remedial measures as may be technically practicable.\n4.   Within the scope of this Agreement, DHS shall inform without undue delay the relevant European authorities about cases of significant privacy incidents involving PNR of EU citizens or residents resulting from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, or any unlawful forms of processing or use.\n5.   The United States confirms that effective administrative, civil, and criminal enforcement measures are available under US law for privacy incidents. DHS may take disciplinary action against persons responsible for any such privacy incident, as appropriate, to include denial of system access, formal reprimands, suspension, demotion, or removal from duty.\n6.   All access to PNR, as well as its processing and use, shall be logged or documented by DHS. Logs or documentation shall be used only for oversight, auditing, and system maintenance purposes or as otherwise required by law.\nArticle 6\nSensitive data\n1.   To the extent that PNR of a passenger as collected includes sensitive data (i.e. personal data and information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or data concerning the health or sex life of the individual), DHS shall employ automated systems to filter and mask out sensitive data from PNR. In addition, DHS shall not further process or use such data, except in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4.\n2.   DHS shall provide to the European Commission within 90 days of the entry into force of this Agreement a list of codes and terms identifying sensitive data that shall be filtered out.\n3.   Access to, as well as processing and use of, sensitive data shall be permitted in exceptional circumstances where the life of an individual could be imperilled or seriously impaired. Such data may be exclusively accessed using restrictive processes on a case-by-case basis with the approval of a DHS senior manager.\n4.   Sensitive data shall be permanently deleted not later than 30 days from the last receipt of PNR containing such data by DHS. However, sensitive data may be retained for the time specified in US law for the purpose of a specific investigation, prosecution or enforcement action.\nArticle 7\nAutomated individual decisions\nThe United States shall not make decisions that produce significant adverse actions affecting the legal interests of individuals based solely on automated processing and use of PNR.\nArticle 8\nRetention of data\n1.   DHS retains PNR in an active database for up to five years. After the initial six months of this period, PNR shall be depersonalised and masked in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. Access to this active database shall, unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement, be restricted to a limited number of specifically authorised officials.\n2.   To achieve depersonalisation, personally identifiable information contained in the following PNR data types shall be masked out:\n(a)\nname(s);\n(b)\nother names on PNR;\n(c)\nall available contact information (including originator information);\n(d)\ngeneral remarks, including other supplementary information (OSI), special service information (SSI), and special service request (SSR); and\n(e)\nany collected Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) information.\n3.   After this active period, PNR shall be transferred to a dormant database for a period of up to ten years. This dormant database shall be subject to additional controls, including a more restricted number of authorised personnel, as well as a higher level of supervisory approval required before access. In this dormant database, PNR shall not be repersonalised except in connection with law enforcement operations and then only in connection with an identifiable case, threat or risk. As regards the purposes as set out in Article 4(1)(b), PNR in this dormant database may only be repersonalised for a period of up to five years.\n4.   Following the dormant period, data retained must be rendered fully anonymised by deleting all data types which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR relate without the possibility of repersonalisation.\n5.   Data that are related to a specific case or investigation may be retained in an active PNR database until the case or investigation is archived. This paragraph is without prejudice to data retention requirements for individual investigation or prosecution files.\n6.   The Parties agree that, within the framework of the evaluation as provided for in Article 23(1), the necessity of a 10-year dormant period of retention will be considered.\nArticle 9\nNon-discrimination\nThe United States shall ensure that the safeguards applicable to processing and use of PNR under this Agreement apply to all passengers on an equal basis without unlawful discrimination.\nArticle 10\nTransparency\n1.   DHS shall provide information to the travelling public regarding its use and processing of PNR through:\n(a)\npublications in the Federal Register;\n(b)\npublications on its website;\n(c)\nnotices that may be incorporated by the carriers into contracts of carriage;\n(d)\nstatutorily required reporting to Congress; and\n(e)\nother appropriate measures as may be developed.\n2.   DHS shall publish and provide to the EU for possible publication its procedures and modalities regarding access, correction or rectification, and redress procedures.\n3.   The Parties shall work with the aviation industry to encourage greater visibility to passengers at the time of booking on the purpose of the collection, processing and use of PNR by DHS, and on how to request access, correction and redress.\nArticle 11\nAccess for individuals\n1.   In accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, any individual, regardless of nationality, country of origin, or place of residence is entitled to request his or her PNR from DHS. DHS shall timely provide such PNR subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.\n2.   Disclosure of information contained in PNR may be subject to reasonable legal limitations, applicable under US law, including any such limitations as may be necessary to safeguard privacy-protected, national security, and law enforcement sensitive information.\n3.   Any refusal or restriction of access shall be set forth in writing and provided to the requesting individual on a timely basis. Such notification shall include the legal basis on which information was withheld and shall inform the individual of the options available under US law for seeking redress.\n4.   DHS shall not disclose PNR to the public, except to the individual whose PNR has been processed and used or his or her representative, or as required by US law.\nArticle 12\nCorrection or rectification for individuals\n1.   Any individual regardless of nationality, country of origin, or place of residence may seek the correction or rectification, including the possibility of erasure or blocking, of his or her PNR by DHS pursuant to the processes described in this Agreement.\n2.   DHS shall inform, without undue delay, the requesting individual in writing of its decision whether to correct or rectify the PNR at issue.\n3.   Any refusal or restriction of correction or rectification shall be set forth in writing and provided to the requesting individual on a timely basis. Such notification shall include the legal basis of such refusal or restriction and shall inform the individual of the options available under US law for seeking redress.\nArticle 13\nRedress for individuals\n1.   Any individual regardless of nationality, country of origin, or place of residence whose personal data and personal information has been processed and used in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement may seek effective administrative and judicial redress in accordance with US law.\n2.   Any individual is entitled to seek to administratively challenge DHS decisions related to the use and processing of PNR.\n3.   Under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law, any individual is entitled to petition for judicial review in US federal court of any final agency action by DHS. Further, any individual is entitled to petition for judicial review in accordance with applicable law and relevant provisions of:\n(a)\nthe Freedom of Information Act;\n(b)\nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act;\n(c)\nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act; and\n(d)\nother applicable provisions of US law.\n4.   In particular, DHS provides all individuals an administrative means (currently the DHS Traveller Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP)) to resolve travel-related inquiries including those related to the use of PNR. DHS TRIP provides a redress process for individuals who believe they have been delayed or prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft because they were wrongly identified as a threat. Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act and Title 49, United States Code, Section 46110, any such aggrieved individual is entitled to petition for judicial review in US federal court from any final agency action by DHS relating to such concerns.\nArticle 14\nOversight\n1.   Compliance with the privacy safeguards in this Agreement shall be subject to independent review and oversight by Department Privacy Officers, such as the DHS Chief Privacy Officer, who:\n(a)\nhave a proven record of autonomy;\n(b)\nexercise effective powers of oversight, investigation, intervention, and review; and\n(c)\nhave the power to refer violations of law related to this Agreement for prosecution or disciplinary action, when appropriate.\nThey shall, in particular, ensure that complaints relating to non-compliance with this Agreement are received, investigated, responded to, and appropriately redressed. These complaints may be brought by any individual, regardless of nationality, country of origin, or place of residence.\n2.   In addition, application of this Agreement by the United States shall be subject to independent review and oversight by one or more of the following entities:\n(a)\nthe DHS Office of Inspector General;\n(b)\nthe Government Accountability Office as established by Congress; and\n(c)\nthe US Congress.\nSuch oversight may be manifested in the findings and recommendations of public reports, public hearings, and analyses.\nCHAPTER III\nMODALITIES OF TRANSFERS\nArticle 15\nMethod of PNR transmission\n1.   For the purposes of this Agreement, carriers shall be required to transfer PNR to DHS using the ‘push’ method, in furtherance of the need for accuracy, timeliness and completeness of PNR.\n2.   Carriers shall be required to transfer PNR to DHS by secure electronic means in compliance with the technical requirements of DHS.\n3.   Carriers shall be required to transfer PNR to DHS in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, initially at 96 hours before the scheduled flight departure and additionally either in real time or for a fixed number of routine and scheduled transfers as specified by DHS.\n4.   In any case, the Parties agree that all carriers shall be required to acquire the technical ability to use the ‘push’ method not later than 24 months following entry into force of this Agreement.\n5.   DHS may, where necessary, on a case-by-case basis, require a carrier to provide PNR between or after the regular transfers described in paragraph 3. Wherever carriers are unable, for technical reasons, to respond timely to requests under this Article in accordance with DHS standards, or, in exceptional circumstances in order to respond to a specific, urgent, and serious threat, DHS may require carriers to otherwise provide access.\nArticle 16\nDomestic sharing\n1.   DHS may share PNR only pursuant to a careful assessment of the following safeguards:\n(a)\nExclusively as consistent with Article 4;\n(b)\nOnly with domestic government authorities when acting in furtherance of the uses outlined in Article 4;\n(c)\nReceiving authorities shall afford to PNR equivalent or comparable safeguards as set out in this Agreement; and\n(d)\nPNR shall be shared only in support of those cases under examination or investigation and pursuant to written understandings and US law on the exchange of information between domestic government authorities.\n2.   When transferring analytical information obtained from PNR under this Agreement, the safeguards set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be respected.\nArticle 17\nOnward transfer\n1.   The United States may transfer PNR to competent government authorities of third countries only under terms consistent with this Agreement and only upon ascertaining that the recipient’s intended use is consistent with those terms.\n2.   Apart from emergency circumstances, any such transfer of data shall occur pursuant to express understandings that incorporate data privacy protections comparable to those applied to PNR by DHS as set out in this Agreement.\n3.   PNR shall be shared only in support of those cases under examination or investigation.\n4.   Where DHS is aware that PNR of a citizen or a resident of an EU Member State is transferred, the competent authorities of the concerned Member State shall be informed of the matter at the earliest appropriate opportunity.\n5.   When transferring analytical information obtained from PNR under this Agreement, the safeguards set forth in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be respected.\nArticle 18\nPolice, law enforcement and judicial cooperation\n1.   Consistent with existing law enforcement or other information-sharing agreements or arrangements between the United States and any EU Member State or Europol and Eurojust, DHS shall provide to competent police, other specialised law enforcement or judicial authorities of the EU Member States and Europol and Eurojust within the remit of their respective mandates, as soon as practicable, relevant, and appropriate, analytical information obtained from PNR in those cases under examination or investigation to prevent, detect, investigate, or prosecute within the European Union terrorist offences and related crimes or transnational crime as described in Article 4(1)(b).\n2.   A police or judicial authority of an EU Member State, or Europol or Eurojust, may request, within its mandate, access to PNR or relevant analytical information obtained from PNR that are necessary in a specific case to prevent, detect, investigate, or prosecute within the European Union terrorist offences and related crimes or transnational crime as described in Article 4(1)(b). DHS shall, subject to the agreements and arrangements noted in paragraph 1 of this Article, provide such information.\n3.   Pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, DHS shall share PNR only following a careful assessment of the following safeguards:\n(a)\nExclusively as consistent with Article 4;\n(b)\nOnly when acting in furtherance of the uses outlined in Article 4; and\n(c)\nReceiving authorities shall afford to PNR equivalent or comparable safeguards as set out in this Agreement.\n4.   When transferring analytical information obtained from PNR under this Agreement, the safeguards set forth in paragraphs 1 to 3 of this Article shall be respected.\nCHAPTER IV\nIMPLEMENTING AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 19\nAdequacy\nIn consideration of this Agreement and its implementation, DHS shall be deemed to provide, within the meaning of relevant EU data protection law, an adequate level of protection for PNR processing and use. In this respect, carriers which have provided PNR to DHS in compliance with this Agreement shall be deemed to have complied with applicable legal requirements in the EU related to the transfer of such data from the EU to the United States.\nArticle 20\nReciprocity\n1.   The Parties shall actively promote the cooperation of carriers within their respective jurisdictions with any PNR system operating or as may be adopted in the other’s jurisdiction, consistent with this Agreement.\n2.   Given that the establishment of an EU PNR system could have a material effect on the Parties’ obligations under this Agreement, if and when an EU PNR system is adopted, the Parties shall consult to determine whether this Agreement would need to be adjusted accordingly to ensure full reciprocity. Such consultations shall in particular examine whether any future EU PNR system would apply less stringent data protection standards than those provided for in this Agreement, and whether, therefore, this Agreement should be amended.\nArticle 21\nImplementation and non-derogation\n1.   This Agreement shall not create or confer, under US law, any right or benefit on any person or entity, private or public. Each Party shall ensure that the provisions of this Agreement are properly implemented.\n2.   Nothing in this Agreement shall derogate from existing obligations of the United States and EU Member States, including under the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance between the European Union and the United States of 25 June 2003 and the related bilateral mutual legal assistance instruments between the United States and EU Member States.\nArticle 22\nNotification of changes in domestic law\nThe Parties shall advise each other regarding the enactment of any legislation that materially affects the implementation of this Agreement.\nArticle 23\nReview and evaluation\n1.   The Parties shall jointly review the implementation of this Agreement one year after its entry into force and regularly thereafter as jointly agreed. Further, the Parties shall jointly evaluate this Agreement four years after its entry into force.\n2.   The Parties shall jointly determine in advance the modalities and terms of the joint review and shall communicate to each other the composition of their respective teams. For the purpose of the joint review, the European Union shall be represented by the European Commission, and the United States shall be represented by DHS. The teams may include appropriate experts on data protection and law enforcement. Subject to applicable laws, participants in the joint review shall be required to have appropriate security clearances and to respect the confidentiality of the discussions. For the purpose of the joint review, DHS shall ensure appropriate access to relevant documentation, systems, and personnel.\n3.   Following the joint review, the European Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The United States shall be given an opportunity to provide written comments which shall be attached to the report.\nArticle 24\nResolution of disputes and suspension of agreement\n1.   Any dispute arising from the implementation of this Agreement, and any matters related thereto, shall give rise to consultations between the Parties, with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution, including providing an opportunity for either Party to cure within a reasonable time.\n2.   In the event that consultations do not result in a resolution of the dispute, either Party may suspend the application of this Agreement by written notification through diplomatic channels, with any such suspension to take effect 90 days from the date of such notification, unless the Parties otherwise agree to a different effective date.\n3.   Notwithstanding any suspension of this Agreement, all PNR obtained by DHS pursuant to this Agreement prior to its suspension shall continue to be processed and used in accordance with the safeguards of this Agreement.\nArticle 25\nTermination\n1.   Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time by written notification through diplomatic channels.\n2.   Termination shall take effect 120 days from the date of such notification, unless the Parties otherwise agree to a different effective date.\n3.   Prior to any termination of this Agreement, the Parties shall consult each other in a manner which allows sufficient time for reaching a mutually agreeable resolution.\n4.   Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, all PNR obtained by DHS pursuant to this Agreement prior to its termination shall continue to be processed and used in accordance with the safeguards of this Agreement.\nArticle 26\nDuration\n1.   Subject to Article 25, this Agreement shall remain in force for a period of seven years from the date of its entry into force.\n2.   Upon the expiry of the period set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article, as well as any subsequent period of renewal under this paragraph, the Agreement shall be renewed for a subsequent period of seven years unless one of the Parties notifies the other in writing through diplomatic channels, at least twelve months in advance, of its intention not to renew the Agreement.\n3.   Notwithstanding the expiration of this Agreement, all PNR obtained by DHS under the terms of this Agreement shall continue to be processed and used in accordance with the safeguards of this Agreement. Similarly, all PNR obtained by DHS under the terms of the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (PNR) data by air carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), signed at Brussels and Washington, 23 and 26 July 2007, shall continue to be processed and used in accordance with the safeguards of that Agreement.\nArticle 27\nFinal provisions\n1.   This Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month after the date on which the Parties have exchanged notifications indicating that they have completed their internal procedures for this purpose.\n2.   This Agreement, as of the date of its entry into force, shall supersede the 23 and 26 July 2007 Agreement.\n3.

Decision 2012/472/EU approves the agreement itself.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nPNR data is the information voluntarily provided by passengers and collected by air carriers during the reservation and check-in procedures. It includes information such as name, dates of travel and travel itinerary, ticket information, contact information, payment/billing information, travel agent, seat number and baggage information.\nKey points of the EU-US PNR agreement are as follows:\nThe use of PNR data will be limited to the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences or transnational crime.\nThere will be a legally binding commitment from the US Department of Homeland Security to inform the Member States and EU authorities of any EU-relevant intelligence leads flowing from the analysis of these PNR data.\nThere will be a robust data protection regime with strong data security and integrity requirements.\nIndividuals will have the right to access their PNR data held in the United States and, if the information is inaccurate, it must be changed or removed.\nThere will be limited usage of PNR data for a period of 10 years for transnational crime and 15 years for terrorism. After 6 months, personally identifiable information of PNR data will be masked out and after 5 years PNR data will be moved to a dormant database with additional controls.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 1 July 2012.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nPNR is the information passengers provide to the airline or travel agent when booking a flight. This information has been used by law enforcement authorities around the world for many years to identify serious criminals and terrorists. It was used, for example, to catch the terrorists behind the planning of a suicide bombing in the subway in New York in 2009. It was also used after the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai and to catch the plotter behind the planned attack in Times Square in 2010. This information is also an extremely important tool to identify drug smugglers.\nThe 2012 EU-US agreement on PNR replaces the EU-US agreement of 2007.\nFor more information, see:\nPassenger Name Record (PNR) (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security (OJ L 215, 11.8.2012, pp. 5-14)\nCouncil Decision 2012/471/EU of 13 December 2011 on the signing, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of Passenger Name Records to the United States Department of Homeland Security (OJ L 215, 11.8.2012, pp. 1-3)\nCouncil Decision 2012/472/EU of 26 April 2012 on the conclusion of the agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security (OJ L 215, 11.8.2012, p. 4)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nInformation concerning the date of entry into force of the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security (OJ L 174, 4.7.2012, p. 1)\nlast update 26.08.2021", "tags": ["agreement (EU)", "ratification of an agreement", "cross-frontier data flow", "terrorism", "personal data", "traveller", "exchange of information", "data recording", "United States"], "subjects": ["Police cooperation", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
