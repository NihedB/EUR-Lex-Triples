For the purposes of this Article, a failure to provide administrative cooperation or assistance shall mean, inter alia:\n(a)\na repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the good(s) concerned;\n(b)\na repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of subsequent verification of the proof of origin;\n(c)\na repeated refusal or undue delay in obtaining authorisation to conduct enquiry visits to determine the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in question.\n4.   For the purposes of this Article, a finding of irregularities or fraud may be made, inter alia, where there is a rapid increase, without satisfactory explanation, in the volume of imports of goods exceeding the usual level of production and export capacity of the other Party that is linked to objective information concerning irregularities or fraud.\n5.   The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe Party which has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation or assistance and/or of irregularities or fraud from the other Party, shall without undue delay notify the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, of its finding together with the objective information and enter into consultations within that Committee, on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties;\n(b)\nwhere the Parties have entered into consultations within the Association Committee in Trade configuration and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the good(s) concerned. A temporary suspension shall be notified to the Association Committee in Trade configuration without undue delay;\n(c)\ntemporary suspensions under this Article shall be limited to that necessary to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed, if at the date of expiry nothing has changed with respect to the condition that gave rise to the initial suspension. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Association Committee in Trade configuration, in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application no longer apply.\n6.   Each Party shall publish in accordance with its internal procedures, notices to importers concerning any: notification referred to in paragraph 5(a); decision referred to in paragraph 5(b); and extension or termination referred to in paragraph 5(c).\nArticle 35\nManagement of administrative errors\nIn case of an error by the competent authorities in the proper management of the preferential system at export, and in particular in the application of the provisions of Protocol I to this Agreement concerning the definition of originating products and methods of administrative cooperation, where this error leads to consequences in terms of import duties, the Party facing such consequences may request the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, to examine the possibilities of adopting all appropriate measures with a view to resolving the situation.\nArticle 36\nAgreements with other countries\n1.   This Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier traffic except in so far as they conflict with trade arrangements provided for in this Agreement.\n2.   Consultations between the Parties shall take place within the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, at the request of either Party, concerning agreements establishing customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier traffic and on other major issues related to their respective trade policy with third countries.

Notwithstanding Article 37 of this Agreement, at the request of the other Party, the Party initiating a safeguard investigation and intending to apply safeguard measures shall provide immediately ad hoc written notification of all the pertinent information leading to the initiation of a safeguard investigation and the imposition of safeguard measures, including, where relevant, information on the initiation of a safeguard investigation, on the provisional findings and on the final findings of the investigation, as well as offer the possibility for consultations to the other Party.\n3.   For the purposes of this Article, a Party shall be considered as having a substantial economic interest when it is among the five largest suppliers of the imported product during the most recent three-year period of time, measured in terms of either absolute volume or value.\nArticle 39\nApplication of measures\n1.   When imposing safeguard measures, the Parties shall endeavour to impose them in a way that affects their bilateral trade the least.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, if a Party considers that the legal requirements for the imposition of definitive safeguard measures are met and intends to apply such measures, that Party shall notify the other Party and give the latter the possibility to hold bilateral consultations. If no satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the notification, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem.\nSection 2\nAnti-dumping and countervailing measures\nArticle 40\nGeneral provisions\n1.

For example, services such as web- or domain-hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services functions.\n3.   Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network, including the internet, include all services that provide:\n(a)\nconsulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of or for computers or computer systems;\n(b)\ncomputer programmes defined as sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), plus consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of or for computer programs; or\n(c)\ndata processing, data storage, data hosting or database services; or maintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers; or training services for staff of clients, related to computer programmes, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.\n4.   Computer and related services enable the provision of other services (e.g. banking) by both electronic and other means. However, there is an important distinction between the enabling service (e.g. web-hosting or application-hosting) and the content or core service that is being delivered electronically (e.g. banking). In such cases, the content or core service is not covered by CPC 84.\nSub-section 4\nPostal and courier services\nArticle 99\nScope and definitions\n1.

A licence may only be required for services which are within the scope of the universal service.\n2.   Where a licence is required, the following shall be made publicly available:\n(a)\nall the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and\n(b)\nthe terms and conditions of licences.\n3.   The reasons for the denial of a licence shall be made known to the applicant upon request and an appeal procedure through an independent body will be established by each Party. Such a procedure will be transparent, non-discriminatory and based on objective criteria.\nArticle 102\nIndependence of the regulatory body\nThe regulatory body shall be legally separate from, and not accountable to any supplier of postal and courier services. The decisions of and the procedures used by the regulatory body shall be impartial with respect to all market participants.\nArticle 103\nGradual approximation\nWith a view to considering further liberalisation of trade in services, the Parties recognise the importance of the gradual approximation of the existing and future legislation of Georgia to the list of the Union acquis included in Annex XV-C to this Agreement.\nSub-section 5\nElectronic communication networks and services\nArticle 104\nScope and definitions\n1.   This Sub-Section sets out the principles of the regulatory framework for all electronic communication services liberalised pursuant to Section 2 (Establishment), Section 3 (Cross-border supply of services) and Section 4 (Temporary presence of natural persons for business purposes) of this Chapter.\n2.

Each Party shall ensure that any services suppliers authorised to provide electronic communication services have the right and obligation to negotiate access and interconnection with suppliers of publicly available electronic communication networks and services. Access and interconnection should in principle be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiation between the services suppliers concerned.\n2.

The regulatory authority may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used;\n(c)\nobligations to meet reasonable requests for access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities, including unbundled access to the local loop, inter alia, in situations where the regulatory authority considers that denial of access or unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level, or would not be in the end user's interest.\nRegulatory authorities may attach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point;\n(d)\nto provide specified services on a wholesale basis for resale by third parties; to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services; to provide co-location or other forms of facility sharing, including duct, building or mast sharing; to provide specified services needed to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users, including facilities for intelligent network services; to provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to ensure fair competition in the provision of services; to interconnect networks or network facilities.\nRegulatory authorities may attach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point;\n(e)\nobligations relating to cost recovery and price controls, including obligations for cost orientation of prices and obligations concerning cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access, in situations where a market analysis indicates that a lack of effective competition means that the operator concerned might sustain prices at an excessively high level, or apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end-users.\nRegulatory authorities shall take into account the investment made by the operator and allow the operator a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed, taking into account the risks involved;\n(f)\nto publish the specific obligations imposed on services suppliers by the regulatory authority identifying the specific product/service and geographical markets. Up-to-date information, provided that it is not confidential and it does not comprise business secrets is made publicly available in a manner that guarantees all interested parties easy access to that information;\n(g)\nobligations for transparency requiring operators to make public specified information and, in particular, where an operator has obligations of non-discrimination, the regulator may require that operator to publish a reference offer, which shall be sufficiently unbundled to ensure that services suppliers are not required to pay for facilities which are not necessary for the service requested, giving a description of the relevant offerings broken down into components according to market needs, and the associated terms and conditions including prices.\n4.   Each Party shall ensure that a service supplier requesting interconnection with a supplier designated as having significant market power shall have recourse, either at any time or after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known, to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in Article 104(2)(d) of this Agreement, to resolve disputes regarding terms and conditions for interconnection and/or access.\nArticle 108\nScarce resources\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, proportionate, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure the effective management of radio frequencies for electronic communication services in their territory with a view to ensure effective and efficient use of the spectrum. Where demand for specific frequencies exceeds their availability, appropriate and transparent procedures shall be followed for the assignment of these frequencies in order to optimise their use and facilitate the development of competition.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that the assignment of national numbering resources and the management of the national numbering plans are entrusted to the regulatory authority.\n4.   Where public or local authorities retain ownership or control of suppliers operating public communications networks and/or services, effective structural separation needs to be ensured between the function responsible for granting the rights of way from activities associated with ownership or control.\nArticle 109\nUniversal service\n1.   Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligations it wishes to maintain.\n2.   Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, objective and non-discriminatory way. The administration of such obligations shall also be neutral with respect to competition and be not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that all suppliers should be eligible to ensure universal service and no services supplier shall be a priori excluded. The designation shall be made through an efficient, transparent, objective and non-discriminatory mechanism. Where necessary, each Party shall assess whether the provision of universal service represents an unfair burden on organisation(s) designated to provide universal service. Where justified on the basis of such calculation, and taking into account the market benefit, if any, which accrues to an organisation that offers the universal service, regulatory authorities shall determine whether a mechanism is required to compensate the services supplier(s) concerned or to share the net cost of universal service obligations.\n4.   Each Party shall ensure that, where directories of all subscribers are available to users, whether printed or electronic, the organisations that provide those directories apply the principle of non-discrimination to the treatment of information that has been provided to them by other organisations.\nArticle 110\nCross-border provision of electronic communication services\nNeither Party may require a service supplier of the other Party to set up an establishment, to establish any form of presence, or to be resident, in its territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service.\nArticle 111\nConfidentiality of information\nEach Party shall ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications and related traffic data by means of a public communication network and publicly available electronic communication services without restricting trade in services.\nArticle 112\nDisputes between services suppliers\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that in the event of a dispute arising between suppliers of electronic communication networks or services in connection with rights and obligations referred to in this Section, the regulatory authority concerned shall, at the request of either Party, issue a binding decision to resolve the dispute in the shortest possible timeframe and in any case within four months.\n2.   The decision of the regulatory authority shall be made available to the public, having regard to the requirements of business confidentiality. The suppliers of electronic communication networks and services concerned shall be given a full statement of the reasons on which it is based.\n3.   When such a dispute concerns the cross-border provision of services, the regulatory authorities concerned shall co-ordinate their efforts in order to bring about a resolution of the dispute.\nArticle 113\nGradual approximation\nWith a view to considering further liberalisation of trade in services, the Parties recognise the importance of the gradual approximation of the existing and future legislation of Georgia to the list of the Union acquis included in the Annex XV-B to this Agreement.\nSub-section 6\nFinancial services\nArticle 114\nScope and definitions\n1.

The Parties shall not impose a general obligation on providers, when providing the services covered by Articles 130, 131 and 132 of this Agreement, to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor shall they impose a general obligation to actively seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity.\n2.   A Party may establish obligations for information society service providers promptly to inform the competent public authorities of alleged illegal activities undertaken or information provided by recipients of their service or obligations to communicate to the competent authorities, at their request, information enabling the identification of recipients of their service with whom they have storage agreements.\nSection 7\nExceptions\nArticle 134\nGeneral exceptions\n1.

The Parties recognise the contribution of transparent, non-discriminatory, competitive and open tendering to sustainable economic development and set as their objective the effective, reciprocal and gradual opening of their respective procurement markets.\n2.   This Chapter envisages mutual access to public procurement markets on the basis of the principle of national treatment at national, regional and local level for public contracts and concessions in the traditional sector as well as in the utilities sector. It provides for a gradual approximation of the public procurement legislation in Georgia with the Union public procurement acquis based on the principles governing public procurement in the Union and the terms and definitions set out in Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (Directive 2004/18/EC) and Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors (Directive 2004/17/EC).\nArticle 142\nScope\n1.   This Chapter applies to works, supplies and services public contracts, as well as works, supplies and services contracts in the utilities sectors and, if and where such contracts are used, to works and services concessions.\n2.   This Chapter applies to any contracting authority and any contracting entity which meets the definitions of the Union public procurement acquis (hereinafter referred to as ‘the contracting entities’). It covers also bodies governed by public law and public undertakings in the field of utilities such as state-owned enterprises carrying out the relevant activities and private undertakings operating on the basis of special and exclusive rights in the field of utilities (25).\n3.   This Chapter applies to contracts above the value thresholds set out in Annex XVI-A to this Agreement.\n4.   The calculation of the estimated value of a public contract shall be based on the total amount payable, net of taxes on value added. When applying these thresholds, Georgia shall calculate and convert contract values into its national currency, using the conversion rate of its national bank.\n5.   Value thresholds shall be revised regularly every two years, beginning in the year of entry into force of this Agreement, based on the average daily value of the euro, expressed in Special Drawing Rights, over the 24 months terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision with effect from January 1. The value of the thresholds thus revised shall, where necessary, be rounded down to nearest thousand euro. The revision of the thresholds shall be adopted by the decision of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement.\nArticle 143\nInstitutional background\n1.   Each Party shall establish or maintain an appropriate institutional framework and mechanisms necessary for the proper functioning of the public procurement system and the implementation of the principles in this Chapter.\n2.   Georgia shall designate in particular:\n(a)\nan executive body at central government level tasked with guaranteeing a coherent policy and its implementation in all areas related to public procurement. That body shall facilitate and coordinate the implementation of this Chapter and guide the process of gradual approximation to the Union acquis, as set out in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement;\n(b)\nan impartial and independent body tasked with the review of decisions taken by contracting authorities or entities during the award of contracts. In this context, ‘independent’ means that that body shall be a public authority which is separate from all contracting entities and economic operators. There shall be a possibility to subject the decisions taken by this body to judicial review.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that decisions taken by the authorities responsible for the review of complaints by economic operators concerning infringements of domestic law shall be effectively enforced.\nArticle 144\n1.   No later than three years from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall comply with a set of basic standards for the award of all contracts as stipulated in paragraphs 2 to 15 of this Article. These basic standards derive directly from the rules and principles of public procurement, as regulated in the Union public procurement acquis, including the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency and proportionality.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that all intended procurements are published in an appropriate media (26) in a manner that is sufficient:\n(a)\nto enable the market to be opened up to competition; and\n(b)\nto allow any interested economic operator to have appropriate access to information regarding the intended procurement prior to the award of the contract and to express its interest in obtaining the contract.\n3.   The publication shall be appropriate to the economic interest of the contract to economic operators.\n4.   The publication shall contain at least the essential details of the contract to be awarded, the criteria for qualitative selection, the award method, the contract award criteria and any other additional information that the economic operators reasonably need to decide whether to express their interest in obtaining the contract.\n5.   All contracts shall be awarded through transparent and impartial award procedures that prevent corruptive practices. This impartiality shall be ensured in particular through the non-discriminatory description of the subject matter of the contract, equal access for all economic operators, appropriate time-limits and a transparent and objective approach.\n6.   When describing the characteristics of the required work, supply or service, the contracting entities shall use general descriptions of performance and functions and international, European or national standards.\n7.   The description of the characteristics required of a work, supply or service shall not refer to a specific make or source, or a particular process, or to trademarks, patents, types or a specific origin or production unless such a reference is justified by the subject matter of the contract and accompanied by the words ‘or equivalent’. Preference shall be given to the use of general descriptions of performance or functions.\n8.   Contracting entities shall not impose conditions resulting in direct or indirect discrimination against the economic operators of the other Party, such as the requirement that economic operators interested in the contract must be established in the same country, region or territory as the contracting entity.\nNotwithstanding the above, in cases where it is justified by the specific circumstances of the contract, the successful applicant may be required to establish certain business infrastructure at the place of performance.\n9.   The time-limits for expression of interest and for submission of offers shall be sufficiently long to allow economic operators from the other Party to make a meaningful assessment of the tender and prepare their offer.\n10.   All participants must be able to know the applicable rules, selection criteria and award criteria in advance. Those rules must apply equally to all participants.\n11.   Contracting entities may invite a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, provided that:\n(a)\nthis is done in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner; and\n(b)\nthe selection is based only on objective factors such as the experience of the applicants in the sector concerned, the size and infrastructure of their businesses or their technical and professional abilities.\nIn inviting a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, account shall be taken of the need to ensure adequate competition.\n12.   Contracting entities may use negotiated procedures only in exceptional and defined cases when the use of such a procedure effectively does not distort competition.\n13.   Contracting entities may use qualification systems only under the condition that the list of qualified operators is compiled by means of a sufficiently advertised, transparent and open procedure. Contracts falling within the scope of such a system shall be awarded also on a non-discriminatory basis.\n14.   Each Party shall ensure that contracts are awarded in a transparent manner to the applicant who has submitted the economically most advantageous offer or the offer with the lowest price, based on the tender criteria and the procedural rules established and communicated in advance. The final decisions shall be communicated to all applicants without undue delay. Upon request of an unsuccessful applicant, reasons must be provided in sufficient detail to allow the review of such a decision.\n15.   Each Party shall ensure that any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been, or risks, being harmed by an alleged infringement is entitled to effective, impartial judicial protection against any decision of the contracting entity related to the award of that contract. The decisions taken in the course and at the end of such review procedure shall be made public in a manner that is sufficient to inform all interested economic operators.\nArticle 145\nPlanning of gradual approximation\n1.   Prior to the commencement of gradual approximation, Georgia shall submit to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, a comprehensive roadmap for the implementation of this Chapter with time schedules and milestones which shall include all reforms in terms of approximation to the Union acquis and institutional capacity building. This roadmap shall comply with the phases and time schedules set out in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement.\n2.   Following a favourable opinion by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, the roadmap shall be considered as the reference document for the implementation of this Chapter. The Union shall make its best efforts in assisting Georgia in the implementation of the roadmap.\nArticle 146\nGradual approximation\n1.   Georgia shall ensure that its legislation on public procurement will be gradually approximated to the Union's public procurement acquis.\n2.   Approximation to the Union acquis shall be carried out in consecutive phases as set out in the schedule in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement and further specified in Annexes XVI-C to XVI-F, XVI-H, XVI-I, and XVI-K thereto. Annexes XVI-G and XVI-J to this Agreement identify non-mandatory elements that need not be approximated, whereas Annexes XVI-L to XVI-O to this Agreement identify elements of the Union acquis that remain outside the scope of approximation. In this process, due account shall be taken of the corresponding case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the implementing measures adopted by the European Commission as well as, should it become necessary, of any modifications of the Union acquis occurring in the meantime. The implementation of each phase shall be evaluated by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, and, following a positive assessment by that Committee, be linked to the reciprocal granting of market access as set out in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement. The European Commission shall notify Georgia without undue delay of any modifications of the Union acquis. It shall, upon request, provide appropriate advice and technical assistance for the purpose of implementing such modifications.\n3.   The Association Committee in Trade configuration shall only proceed to the evaluation of a next phase once the measures to implement the previous phase have been carried out and approved in accordance with the modalities set out in paragraph 2.\n4.   Each Party shall ensure that those aspects and areas of public procurement which are not covered by this Article comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment as set out under Article 144 of this Agreement.\nArticle 147\nMarket access\n1.   The Parties agree that the effective and reciprocal opening of their respective markets shall be attained gradually and simultaneously. During the process of approximation, the extent of the market access mutually granted shall be linked to the progress made in this process as stipulated in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement.\n2.   The decision to proceed to a further phase of market opening shall be made on the basis of an assessment of the compliance of the legislation adopted with the Union acquis as well as its practical implementation. Such assessment shall be carried out regularly by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement.\n3.   In so far as a Party has, in accordance with Annex XVI-B to this Agreement, opened its procurement market to the other Party:\n(a)\nthe Union shall grant access to contract award procedures to Georgian companies, whether established or not in the Union, pursuant to the Union public procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Union companies;\n(b)\nGeorgia shall grant access to contract award procedures for Union companies, whether established or not in Georgia, pursuant to national procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Georgian companies.\n4.   After the implementation of the last phase in the process of approximation, the Parties will examine the possibility to mutually grant market access with regard to procurement below the value thresholds set out in Annex XVI-A to this Agreement.\n5.   Finland reserves its position with regard to the Åland Islands.\nArticle 148\nInformation\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that contracting entities and economic operators are appropriately informed about public procurement procedures, including through the publication of all relevant legislation and administrative rulings.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure the effective dissemination of information on tendering opportunities.\nArticle 149\nCooperation\n1.   The Parties shall enhance their cooperation through exchanges of experience and information relating to their best practices and regulatory frameworks.\n2.   The Union shall facilitate the implementation of this Chapter, including through technical assistance where appropriate. In line with the provisions on financial cooperation in Title VII (Financial Assistance, and Anti-fraud and Control Provisions) of this Agreement, specific decisions on financial assistance shall be taken through the relevant Union funding mechanisms and instruments.\n3.   An indicative list of issues for cooperation is included in Annex XVI-P to this Agreement.\nCHAPTER 9\nIntellectual property rights\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 150\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this Chapter are to:\n(a)\nfacilitate the production and commercialisation of innovative and creative products between the Parties; and\n(b)\nachieve an adequate and effective level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nArticle 151\nNature and scope of obligations\n1.   The Parties shall ensure the adequate and effective implementation of the international treaties dealing with intellectual property to which they are parties including the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). The provisions of this Chapter shall complement and further specify the rights and obligations between the Parties under the TRIPS Agreement and other international treaties in the field of intellectual property.\n2.

Each Party shall provide a right in order to ensure that a single equitable remuneration is paid by the user, if a phonogram published for commercial purposes, or a reproduction of such phonogram, is used for broadcasting by wireless means or for any communication to the public, and to ensure that this remuneration is shared between the relevant performers and phonogram producers.\n2.   Each Party may, in the absence of agreement between the performers and phonogram producers, lay down the conditions as to the sharing of this remuneration between them.\nArticle 159\nTerm of protection\n1.   The rights of an author of a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Article 2 of the Berne Convention shall run for the life of the author and for 70 years after his/her death, irrespective of the date when the work is lawfully made available to the public.\n2.   The term of protection of a musical composition with words shall expire 70 years after the death of the last of the following persons to survive, whether or not those persons are designated as co-authors: the author of the lyrics and the composer of the musical composition, provided that both contributions were specifically created for the respective musical composition with words.\n3.

Having examined the Law of Georgia on appellations of origin and Geographical Indications of Goods, adopted on 22 August 1999, the Union concludes that that law meets the elements laid down in Annex XVII-A to this Agreement.\n2.   Having examined Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 of 10 June 1991 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatised wines, aromatized wine-based drinks and aromatized wine-product cocktails, Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, with its implementing rules, for the registration, control and protection of geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs in the European Union, Section I of Chapter I of Title II of Part II of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) and Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks, Georgia concludes that those laws, rules and procedures meet the elements laid down in Annex XVII-A to this Agreement.\n3.   Georgia, after having completed an objection procedure in accordance with the criteria set in Annex XVII-B to this Agreement, having examined a summary of the specifications of the agricultural products and foodstuffs corresponding to the geographical indications of the Union listed in Annex XVII-C to this Agreement and the geographical indications for wines, aromatised wines and spirit drinks listed in Annex XVII-D to this Agreement, which have been registered by the Union under the legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall protect those geographical indications according to the level of protection laid down in this Sub-section.\n4.   The Union, after having completed an objection procedure in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex XVII-B to this Agreement, having examined a summary of the specifications of the agricultural products and foodstuffs corresponding to the geographical indications of Georgia listed in Annex XVII-C to this Agreement and the geographical indications for wines, aromatised wines and spirit drinks listed in Annex XVII-D to this Agreement, which are registered by Georgia under the legislation referred to in paragraph 1, shall protect those geographical indications according to the level of protection laid down in this Sub-Section.\n5.   The decisions of the Joint Committee set up by Article 11 of the Agreement between the European Union and Georgia on protection of geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs concerning the amendment of Annexes III and IV to that Agreement, which are taken before the entry into force of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be decisions of the Geographical Indications Sub-Committee, and the geographical indications added to Annexes III and IV to that Agreement shall be deemed to be part of Annexes XVII-C and XVII-D of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties shall protect those geographical indications as established geographical indications under this Agreement.\nArticle 171\nAddition of new geographical indications\n1.   The Parties agree on the possibility to add new geographical indications to be protected in Annexes XVII-C and XVII-D to this Agreement in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 179(3) of this Agreement after having completed the objection procedure and after having examined a summary of the specifications as referred to in Article 170(3) and (4) of this Agreement to the satisfaction of both Parties.\n2.   A Party shall not be required to protect as a geographical indication a name that conflicts with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\nArticle 172\nScope of protection of geographical indications\n1.   The geographical indications listed in Annexes XVII-C and XVII-D to this Agreement, as well as those added pursuant to Article 171 of this Agreement, shall be protected against:\n(a)\nany direct or indirect commercial use of a protected name:\n(i)\nfor comparable products not compliant with the product specification of the protected name, or\n(ii)\nin so far as such use exploits the reputation of a geographical indication;\n(b)\nany misuse, imitation or evocation (28), even if the true origin of the product is indicated or if the protected name is translated or accompanied by an expression such as ‘style’, ‘type’, ‘method’, ‘as produced in’, ‘imitation’, ‘flavour’, ‘like’ or similar;\n(c)\nany other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product, on the inner or outer packaging, advertising material or documents relating to the product concerned, and the packing of the product in a container liable to convey a false impression as to its origin;\n(d)\nany other practice liable to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\n2.   If geographical indications are wholly or partially homonymous, protection shall be granted to each indication provided that it has been used in good faith and with due regard for local and traditional usage and the actual risk of confusion. Without prejudice to Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement, the Parties shall mutually decide the practical conditions of use under which the homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled. A homonymous name which misleads the consumer into believing that products come from another territory shall not be registered even if the name is accurate as far as the actual territory, region or place of origin of the product in question is concerned.\n3.   Where a Party, in the context of negotiations with a third country, proposes to protect a geographical indication of that third country, and the name is homonymous with a geographical indication of the other Party, the latter shall be informed and be given the opportunity to comment before the name becomes protected.\n4.   Nothing in this Sub-Section shall oblige a Party to protect a geographical indication of the other Party which is not or ceases to be protected in its country of origin. The Parties shall notify each other if a geographical indication ceases to be protected in its country of origin.\nArticle 173\nProtection of transcription of geographical indications\n1.   Geographical indications protected under this Sub-Section in the characters of the Georgian alphabet and other non-Latin alphabets officially used in the Member States shall be protected together with their transcription in Latin characters. This transcription may also be used for labelling purposes for the products concerned.\n2.   Similarly, geographical indications protected under this Sub-Section in a Latin alphabet shall be protected together with their transcription in the characters of the Georgian alphabet and in the characters of other non-Latin alphabets officially used in the Member States. This transcription may also be used for labelling purposes for the products concerned.\nArticle 174\nRight of use of geographical indications\n1.   A name protected under this Sub-Section may be used by any operator marketing agricultural products, foodstuffs, wines, aromatised wines or spirit drinks conforming to the corresponding specification.\n2.   Once a geographical indication is protected under this Sub-Section, the use of such protected name shall not be subject to any registration of users or further charges.\nArticle 175\nEnforcement of protection\nThe Parties shall enforce the protection provided for in Articles 170 to 174 of this Agreement by appropriate administrative action by their public authorities. They shall also enforce such protection at the request of an interested party.\nArticle 176\nRelationship with trademarks\n1.   The Parties shall refuse to register or shall invalidate, ex officio or at the request of any interested party in conformity with the legislation of each Party, a trademark that corresponds to any of the situations referred to in Article 172(1) of this Agreement in relation to a protected geographical indication for like products, provided an application to register the trademark is submitted after the date of application for protection of the geographical indication in the territory concerned.\n2.   For geographical indications referred to in Article 170 of this Agreement, the date of application for protection shall be 1 April 2012.\n3.   For geographical indications referred to in Article 171 of this Agreement, the date of application for protection shall be the date of the transmission of a request to the other Party to protect a geographical indication.\n4.   The Parties shall have no obligation to protect a geographical indication where, in the light of a reputed or well-known trademark, protection is liable to mislead consumers as to the true identity of the product.\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4, the Parties shall protect geographical indications also where a prior trademark exists. A prior trademark shall mean a trademark the use of which corresponds to one of the situations referred to in Article 172(1) of this Agreement, which has been applied for, registered or established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the legislation concerned, in the territory of one of the Parties before the date on which the application for protection of the geographical indication is submitted by the other Party under this Sub-Section. Such trademark may continue to be used and renewed notwithstanding the protection of the geographical indication, provided that no grounds for the trademark's invalidity or revocation exist in the legislation on trademarks of the Parties.\nArticle 177\nGeneral rules\n1.   This Sub-Section shall apply without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under the WTO Agreement.\n2.   The import, export and marketing of any product referred to in Articles 170 and 171 of this Agreement shall be conducted in compliance with the laws and regulations applying in the territory of the importing Party.\n3.   Any matter arising from technical specifications of registered names shall be dealt with in the Sub-Committee established in Article 179 of this Agreement.\n4.   Geographical indications protected under this Sub-Section may only be cancelled by the Party in which the product originates.\n5.   A product specification referred to in this Sub-Section shall be that approved, including any amendments also approved, by the authorities of the Party in the territory of which the product originates.\nArticle 178\nCooperation and transparency\n1.   The Parties shall, either directly or through the Geographical Indications Sub-Committee established pursuant to Article 179 of this Agreement, maintain contact on all matters relating to the implementation and the functioning of this Sub-Section. In particular, a Party may request from the other Party information relating to product specifications and their modification, and contact points for control provisions.\n2.   Each Party may make publicly available the specifications or a summary thereof and contact points for control provisions corresponding to geographical indications of the other Party protected pursuant to this Article.\nArticle 179\nGeographical Indications Sub-Committee\n1.   The Geographical Indications Sub-Committee is hereby established. It shall consist of representatives of the Union and of Georgia with the purpose of monitoring the development of this Sub-Section and of intensifying their cooperation and dialogue on geographical indications. It shall report to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement.\n2.   The Geographical Indications Sub-Committee adopts its decisions by consensus. It shall determine its own rules of procedure. It shall meet at the request of either of the Parties, alternatively in the EU and in Georgia, at a time and a place and in a manner (which may include by videoconference) mutually determined by the Parties, but no later than 90 days after the request.\n3.   The Geographical Indications Sub-Committee shall also see to the proper functioning of this Sub-Section and may consider any matter related to its implementation and operation. In particular, it shall be responsible for:\n(a)\namending Article 170(1) and (2) of this Agreement, as regards the references to the law applicable in the Parties;\n(b)\nmodifying Annexes XVII-C and XVII-D to this Agreement as regards geographical indications;\n(c)\nexchanging information on legislative and policy developments on geographical indications and any other matter of mutual interest in the area of geographical indications;\n(d)\nexchanging information on geographical indications for the purpose of considering their protection in accordance with this Sub-Section.\nSub-section 4\nDesigns\nArticle 180\nInternational agreements\nThe Parties reaffirm their commitment to the Geneva Act to the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs of 1999.\nArticle 181\nProtection of registered designs\n1.   Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently created designs that are new and are original (29). This protection shall be provided by registration, which shall confer an exclusive right upon the holder of a registered design in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n2.   A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and original:\n(a)\nif the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the latter, and\n(b)\nto the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality.\n3.   The expression ‘normal use’ in point (a) of paragraph 2 shall mean use by the end user, excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work.\n4.   The holder of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from, at a minimum, making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking or using a product bearing or embodying the protected design when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes, unduly prejudice the normal exploitation of the design, or are not compatible with fair trade practices.\n5.   The duration of protection available shall amount to 25 years, from the date of filing of the application for registration or from a date established in accordance with the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, without prejudice to the Paris Convention.\nArticle 182\nExceptions and exclusions\n1.   Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.\n2.   Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations. In particular a design right shall not subsist in features of appearance of a product which are required to be reproduced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function.\nArticle 183\nRelationship to copyright\nA design shall also be eligible for protection under the law of copyright of a Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such a protection is conferred, including the level of originality required, shall be determined by each Party.\nSub-section 5\nPatents\nArticle 184\nInternational agreements\nThe Parties reaffirm their commitment to the WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty.\nArticle 185\nPatents and public health\n1.   The Parties recognise the importance of the Declaration of the Ministerial Conference of the WTO on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health adopted on 14 November 2001.\n2.   The Parties shall respect the Decision of the WTO General Council of 30 August 2003 on paragraph 6 of the declaration referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and shall contribute to its implementation.\nArticle 186\nSupplementary protection certificate\n1.   The Parties recognise that medicinal and plant protection products protected by a patent on their respective territory may be subject to an administrative authorisation procedure before being put on their market. They recognise that the period that elapses between the filing of the application for a patent and the first authorisation to place the product on their respective market, as defined for that purpose by domestic law, may shorten the period of effective protection under the patent.\n2.   Each Party shall provide for a further period of protection for a medicinal or plant protection product which is protected by a patent and which has been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure, that period being equal to the period referred to in the second sentence of paragraph 1, reduced by a period of five years.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the duration of the further period of protection may not exceed five years.\n4.   In the case of medicinal products for which paediatric studies have been carried out, and provided that the results of those studies are reflected in the product information, the Parties shall provide for a further six months extension of the period of protection referred to in paragraph 2.\nArticle 187\nProtection of data submitted to obtain a marketing authorisation for medicinal products (30)\n1.   The Parties shall implement a comprehensive system to guarantee the confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-reliance of data submitted for the purpose of obtaining an authorisation to put a medicinal product on the market.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure, in its law, that any information submitted to obtain an authorisation to put a medicinal product on the market remains confidential and undisclosed to third parties and benefits from protection against unfair commercial use.\n3.   For that purpose, each Party shall not, for a period of at least six years from the date of the first authorisation in one of the Parties, permit other applicants to market the same or a similar product, on the basis of the marketing authorisation granted to the applicant which had provided the test data or studies, unless the applicant which had provided the test data or studies has given his consent. During such period, the test data or studies submitted for the first authorisation shall not be used for the benefit of any subsequent applicant aiming to obtain a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product, except when the consent of the first applicant is provided.\n4.   The six year period referred to in paragraph 3 shall be extended to a maximum of seven years if, during the first six years after obtaining the initial authorisation, the holder obtains an authorisation for one or more new therapeutic indications which are considered of significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.\n5.   Georgia undertakes to align its legislation concerning data protection for medicinal products with that of the Union at a date to be decided by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement.\nArticle 188\nProtection of data to obtain a marketing authorisation for plant protection products\n1.   Each Party shall determine safety and efficacy requirements before authorising the placing on the market of plant protection products.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that data submitted for the first time by an applicant to obtain a marketing authorisation for a plant protection product benefits from protection against unfair commercial use and is not used for the benefit of any other person aiming to obtain a marketing authorisation, unless the proof of the explicit consent of the first holder is provided.\n3.   The test or study report submitted for the first time to obtain a marketing authorisation shall fulfil the following conditions:\n(a)\nthat it is for the authorisation, or for an amendment of an authorisation in order to allow the use on other crops, and\n(b)\nthat it is certified as compliant with the principles of good laboratory practice or of good experimental practice.\n4.   The period of protection of data shall be at least ten years starting from the date of the first marketing authorisation in the Party concerned.\nArticle 189\nPlant varieties\nThe Parties shall protect plant varieties rights, in accordance with the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants and shall cooperate to promote and enforce those rights.\nSection 3\nEnforcement of intellectual property rights\nArticle 190\nGeneral obligations\n1.   The Parties reaffirm their commitments under the TRIPS Agreement, and in particular Part III thereof, and shall provide for the complementary measures, procedures and remedies set out in this Section necessary to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights (31).\n2.   Those complementary measures, procedures and remedies shall be fair and equitable, and shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.\n3.   Those complementary measures and remedies shall also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.\nArticle 191\nEntitled applicants\nEach Party shall recognise as persons entitled to seek application of the measures, procedures and remedies referred to in this Section and in Part III of the TRIPS Agreement:\n(a)\nthe holders of intellectual property rights in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law,\n(b)\nall other persons authorised to use those rights, in particular licencees, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law;\n(c)\nintellectual property collective rights management bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law,\n(d)\nprofessional defence bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law.\nSub-section 1\nCivil enforcement\nArticle 192\nMeasures for preserving evidence\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that, even before the commencement of proceedings on the merits of the case, the competent judicial authorities may, on application by a party who has presented reasonably available evidence to support his/her claims that his/her intellectual property right has been infringed or is about to be infringed, order prompt and effective provisional measures to preserve relevant evidence in respect of the alleged infringement, subject to the protection of confidential information.\n2.   Such measures may include the detailed description, with or without the taking of samples, or the physical seizure of the alleged infringing goods, and, in appropriate cases, the materials and implements used in the production and/or distribution of these goods and the documents relating thereto. Those measures shall be taken, if necessary without the other party being heard, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holder or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed.\n3.   Where measures to preserve evidence are adopted without the other party having been heard, the parties affected shall be given notice without delay and at the latest after the execution of the measures.\nArticle 193\nRight of information\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that, in the context of proceedings concerning an infringement of an intellectual property right and in response to a justified and proportionate request of the claimant, the competent judicial authorities may order that information on the origin and distribution networks of the goods or services which infringe an intellectual property right be provided by the infringer and/or any other person who:\n(a)\nwas found in possession of the infringing goods on a commercial scale;\n(b)\nwas found to be using the infringing services on a commercial scale;\n(c)\nwas found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities; or\n(d)\nwas found to be producing, manufacturing or distributing infringing goods or to be providing services, through information provided by any person referred to in points (a), (b), or (c).\n2.   The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall, as appropriate, comprise:\n(a)\nthe names and addresses of the producers, manufacturers, distributors, suppliers and other previous holders of the goods or services, as well as the intended wholesalers and retailers, and\n(b)\ninformation on the quantities produced, manufactured, delivered, received or ordered, as well as the price obtained for the goods or services in question.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to other statutory provisions which:\n(a)\ngrant the right holder rights to receive fuller information;\n(b)\ngovern the use in civil or criminal proceedings of the information communicated pursuant to this Article;\n(c)\ngovern responsibility for misuse of the right of information;\n(d)\nafford an opportunity for refusing to provide information which would force the person referred to in paragraph 1 to admit to his/her own participation or that of his/her close relatives in an infringement of an intellectual property right; or\n(e)\ngovern the protection of confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data.\nArticle 194\nProvisional measures\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that the judicial authorities may, at the request of the applicant, issue against the alleged infringer an interlocutory injunction intended to prevent any imminent infringement of an intellectual property right, or to forbid, on a provisional basis and subject, where appropriate, to a recurring penalty payment where provided for by domestic law, the continuation of the alleged infringements of that right, or to make such continuation subject to the lodging of guarantees intended to ensure the compensation of the right holder. An interlocutory injunction may also be issued, under the same conditions, against an intermediary whose services are being used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right.\n2.   An interlocutory injunction may also be issued to order the seizure or delivery up of goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right, so as to prevent their entry into or movement within the channels of commerce.\n3.   In the case of an alleged infringement committed on a commercial scale, the Parties shall ensure that, if the applicant demonstrates circumstances likely to endanger the recovery of damages, the judicial authorities may order the precautionary seizure of the movable and immovable property of the alleged infringer, including the blocking of his/her bank accounts and other assets. To that end, the competent authorities may order access, where appropriate, to banking, financial or commercial documents under the control of the alleged infringer.\nArticle 195\nMeasures resulting from a decision on the merits of the case\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that the competent judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant and without prejudice to any damages due to the right holder by reason of the infringement, and without compensation of any sort, at least the definitive removal from the channels of commerce, or the destruction, of goods that they have found to be infringing an intellectual property right. If appropriate, the competent judicial authorities may also order the destruction of materials and implements predominantly used in the creation or manufacture of those goods.\n2.   The Parties' judicial authorities shall have the power to order that those measures shall be carried out at the expense of the infringer, unless particular reasons are invoked for not doing so.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that, where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may issue against the infringer as well as against any intermediary whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right an injunction aimed at prohibiting the continuation of the infringement.\n4.   The Parties may provide that, in appropriate cases and at the request of the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in this Article, the competent judicial authorities may order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in this Article if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, if execution of the measures in question would cause him/her disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.\nArticle 196\nDamages\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that the judicial authorities, on application of the injured party, order the infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in an infringing activity, to pay the right holder damages appropriate to the actual prejudice suffered by that right holder as a result of the infringement. When the judicial authorities set the damages:\n(a)\nthey shall take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative economic consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringer and, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors, such as moral prejudice, caused to the right holder by the infringement; or\n(b)\nas an alternative to (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.\n2.   Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, the Parties may lay down that the judicial authorities may order in favour of the injured party the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established.\nArticle 197\nLegal costs\nEach Party shall ensure that reasonable and proportionate legal costs and other expenses incurred by the successful party shall as a general rule be borne by the unsuccessful party, unless equity does not allow this and without prejudice to exceptions provided by domestic procedural rules.\nArticle 198\nPublication of judicial decisions\nEach Party shall ensure that, either in legal proceedings instituted for infringement of an industrial property right or in legal proceedings instituted for infringement of copyright, or in both cases, the judicial authorities may order at the request of the applicant and at the expense of the infringer, appropriate measures for the dissemination of the information concerning the decision, including displaying the decision and publishing it in full or in part.\nArticle 199\nPresumption of authorship or ownership\nFor the purposes of applying the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in this Sub-Section:\n(a)\nfor the author of a literary or artistic work, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to be regarded as such, and consequently to be entitled to institute infringement proceedings, it shall be sufficient for his/her name to appear on the work in the usual manner;\n(b)\nthe provision under point (a) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the holders of rights related to copyright with regard to their protected subject matter.\nSub-section 2\nOther provisions\nArticle 200\nBorder measures\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 75 of this Agreement and to Annex XIII to this Agreement, this Article establishes the general principles of this Agreement governing the enforcement of intellectual property rights by customs authorities and the obligations of the customs authorities of the Parties to engage in cooperation.\n2.   When implementing border measures for the enforcement of intellectual property rights the Parties shall ensure consistency with their obligations under GATT 1994 and the TRIPS Agreement.\n3.   The provisions on border measures in this Article are of procedural nature. They set out the conditions and procedures for action by the customs authorities where goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right are, or should have been, under customs control. They shall not affect in any way the substantive law of the Parties on intellectual property.\n4.   To facilitate the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights, the customs authorities shall adopt a range of approaches to identify shipments containing goods suspected of infringing intellectual property rights. These approaches include risk analysis techniques based, inter alia, on information provided by rights holders, intelligence gathered and cargo inspections.\n5.   The Parties agree to effectively implement Article 69 of the TRIPS Agreement in respect of international trade in goods suspected of infringing intellectual property rights. For that purpose, the Parties shall establish and notify contact points in their customs administrations and shall be ready to exchange data and information on trade in such goods affecting both Parties. They shall, in particular, promote the exchange of information and cooperation between customs authorities with regard to trade in counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods. Without prejudice to the provisions of Protocol II on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters to this Agreement customs authorities shall, where appropriate, exchange such information swiftly and with due respect to data protection laws of the Parties.\n6.   The customs authorities of each Party shall cooperate, upon request or upon their own initiative, to provide relevant available information to the customs authorities of the other Party, in particular for goods in transit through the territory of a Party destined for (or originating in) the other Party.\n7.   The Sub-Committee referred to in Article 74 of this Agreement shall establish the necessary practical arrangements concerning the exchange of data and information referred to in this Article.\n8.   Protocol II on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters to this Agreement shall be applicable in respect to breaches of intellectual property rights, without prejudice to forms of cooperation resulting from the application of paragraphs 5 to 7 of this Article.\n9.   The Sub-Committee referred to in Article 74 of this Agreement shall act as the responsible Sub-Committee to ensure the proper functioning and implementation of this Article.\nArticle 201\nCodes of conduct\nThe Parties shall encourage:\n(a)\nthe development by trade or professional associations or organisations of codes of conduct aimed at contributing towards the enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n(b)\nthe submission to their respective competent authorities of draft codes of conduct and of any evaluations of the application of those codes of conduct.\nArticle 202\nCooperation\n1.   The Parties agree to cooperate with a view to supporting the implementation of the commitments and obligations undertaken under this Chapter.\n2.   Areas of cooperation include, but are not limited to, the following activities:\n(a)\nexchange of information on the legal framework concerning intellectual property rights and relevant rules of protection and enforcement; exchange of experiences on legislative progress in those areas;\n(b)\nexchange of experiences and information on the enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n(c)\nexchange of experiences on central and sub-central enforcement by customs, police, administrative and judiciary bodies; coordination to prevent exports of counterfeit goods, including with other countries;\n(d)\ncapacity-building; exchange and training of personnel;\n(e)\npromotion and dissemination of information on intellectual property rights in, inter alia, business circles and civil society; public awareness of consumers and right holders;\n(f)\nenhancement of institutional cooperation, for example between intellectual property offices;\n(g)\nactively promoting awareness and education of the general public on policies concerning intellectual property rights: formulate effective strategies to identify key audiences and create communication programmes to increase consumer and media awareness on the impact of intellectual property violations, including the risk to health and safety and the connection to organised crime.\nCHAPTER 10\nCompetition\nArticle 203\nPrinciples\nThe Parties recognise the importance of free and undistorted competition in their trade relations. The Parties acknowledge that anti-competitive business practices and state interventions (including subsidies) have the potential to distort the proper functioning of markets and undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation.\nArticle 204\nAntitrust and mergers legislation and its implementation\n1.   Each Party shall maintain in its respective territory comprehensive competition laws, which effectively address anti-competitive agreements, concerted practices and anti-competitive unilateral conduct of enterprises with dominant market power and which provide effective control of concentrations to avoid significant impediment to effective competition and abuse of dominant position.\n2.   Each Party shall maintain an authority responsible and appropriately equipped for the effective enforcement of the competition laws referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   The Parties recognise the importance of applying their respective competition laws in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, respecting the principles of procedural fairness and rights of defence of the enterprises concerned.\nArticle 205\nState monopolies, state enterprises and enterprises entrusted with special or exclusive rights\n1.   Nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from designating or maintaining state monopolies, state enterprises or to entrust enterprises with special or exclusive rights in accordance with its respective laws.\n2.   With regard to state monopolies of a commercial character, state enterprises and enterprises entrusted with special or exclusive rights, each Party shall ensure that such enterprises are subject to the competition laws referred to in Article 204(1), in so far as the application of those laws does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks of public interest assigned to the enterprises in question.\nArticle 206\nSubsidies\n1.

A Party shall seek consultations by means of a written request to the other Party, copied to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, giving reasons for the request, including by identifying the measure at issue and the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement that it considers applicable.\n3.   Consultations shall be held within 30 days of the date of receipt of the request and take place, unless the Parties agree otherwise, in the territory of the Party to which the request is made. The consultations shall be deemed concluded within 30 days of the date of receipt of the request, unless both Parties agree to continue consultations. Consultations, in particular all information disclosed and positions taken by the Parties during the consultations, shall be confidential, and without prejudice to the rights of either Party in any further proceedings.\n4.   Consultations on matters of urgency, including those regarding perishable goods or seasonal goods or services shall be held within 15 days of the date of receipt of the request by the requested Party, and shall be deemed concluded within those 15 days unless both Parties agree to continue consultations.\n5.   If the Party to which the request is made does not respond to the request for consultations within ten days of the date of its receipt, or if consultations are not held within the timeframes laid down in paragraph 3 or in paragraph 4 of this Article respectively, or if the Parties agree not to have consultations, or if consultations have been concluded and no mutually agreed solution has been reached, the Party that sought consultations may have recourse to Article 248 of this Agreement.\n6.   During the consultations each Party shall deliver sufficient factual information, so as to allow a complete examination of the manner in which the measure at issue could affect the operation and the application of this Agreement.\n7.   Where consultations concern the transport of energy goods through networks and one Party views the resolution of the dispute as urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of transport of natural gas, oil or electricity between the Parties the consultations shall be held within three days of the date of submission of the request, and shall be deemed concluded three days after the date of submission of the request unless both Parties agree to continue consultations.\nArticle 247\nMediation\nAny Party may request the other Party to enter into a mediation procedure pursuant to Annex XIX to this Agreement with respect to any measure adversely affecting its trade interests.\nSection 3\nDispute settlement procedures\nSub-section 1\nArbitration procedure\nArticle 248\nInitiation of the arbitration procedure\n1.   Where the Parties have failed to resolve the dispute by recourse to consultations as provided for in Article 246 of this Agreement, the Party that sought consultations may request the establishment of an arbitration panel in accordance with this Article.\n2.   The request for the establishment of an arbitration panel shall be made in writing to the other Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement. The complaining Party shall identify in its request the measure at issue, and it shall explain how such measure is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement in a manner sufficient to present the legal basis for the complaint clearly.\nArticle 249\nEstablishment of the arbitration panel\n1.   An arbitration panel shall be composed of three arbitrators.\n2.   Upon receipt of the request for the establishment of an arbitration panel, the Parties shall consult promptly and shall endeavour to reach an agreement on the composition of the arbitration panel. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, the Parties may at any time before the establishment of the arbitration panel decide to compose the arbitration panel by mutual agreement.\n3.   Either Party may request to apply the procedure for panel composition laid down in this paragraph after five days from the request for the establishment of a panel, if no agreement has been found on the composition of the arbitration panel. Each Party may appoint an arbitrator from the list established under Article 268 of this Agreement within ten days from the date of request to apply the procedure in this paragraph. If any of the Parties fails to appoint the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall, upon request of the other Party, the arbitrator shall be selected by lot by the chair or co-chairs of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, or their delegates, from the sub-list of that Party contained in the list established under Article 268 of this Agreement. Unless the Parties have reached an agreement concerning the chairperson of the arbitration panel, upon request of any of the Parties, the chair or co-chairs of the Association Committee in Trade configuration or their delegates, shall select by lot the chairperson of the arbitration panel from the sub-list of chairpersons contained in the list established under Article 268 of this Agreement.\n4.   In the event of selection by lot of one or more arbitrators, the draw shall take place within five days of the request to select by lot referred to in paragraph 3.\n5.   The date of establishment of the arbitration panel shall be the date on which the last of the three selected arbitrators accepted the appointment in accordance with the Rules of Procedure in Annex XX to this Agreement.\n6.   Should any of the lists provided for in Article 268 of this Agreement not be established or not contain sufficient names at the time a request is made pursuant to paragraph 3, the arbitrators shall be drawn by lot. The draw shall take place from the individuals who have been formally proposed by each of the Parties or, in case one Party has failed to make such proposal, the draw shall be made from the individuals proposed by the other Party.\n7.   Unless the Parties agree otherwise, in respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related energy) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil, or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, the procedure of selection by lot envisaged in paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply without recourse to the first sentence of paragraph 2 of this Article or to the other steps provided for in paragraph 3 of this Article, and the period referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article shall be two days.\nArticle 250\nPreliminary ruling on urgency\nIf a Party so requests, the arbitration panel shall, within ten days of the date of its establishment, give a preliminary ruling on whether it deems the case to be urgent.\nArticle 251\nArbitration panel report\n1.   The arbitration panel shall notify an interim report to the Parties setting out the findings of fact, the applicability of relevant provisions and the basic rationale behind any findings and recommendations that it makes, no later than 90 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. Where it considers that this deadline cannot be met, the chairperson of the arbitration panel shall notify the Parties and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the panel plans to notify its interim report. Under no circumstances should the interim report be notified later than 120 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. The interim report shall not be made public.\n2.   A Party may submit a written request to the arbitration panel to review precise aspects of the interim report within 14 days of its notification.\n3.   In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods or seasonal goods or services, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to notify its interim report within 45 days and, in any case, no later than 60 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. A Party may submit a written request to the arbitration panel to review precise aspects of the interim report, within 7 days of the notification of the interim report.\n4.   After considering any written comments by the Parties on the interim report, the arbitration panel may modify its report and make any further examination it considers appropriate. The findings of the final panel ruling shall include a sufficient discussion of the arguments made at the interim review stage, and shall answer clearly to the questions and observations of the two Parties.\n5.   In respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related energy) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil or electricity or a threat thereof, between the Parties, the interim report shall be notified 20 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration panel, and any request pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article shall be made within five days of the notification of the written report. The arbitration panel may also decide to dispense with the interim report.\nArticle 252\nConciliation for urgent energy disputes\n1.   In respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related energy) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil, or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, either Party may request the chairperson of the arbitration panel to act as a conciliator concerning any matter related to the dispute by making a request to the notified panel.\n2.   The conciliator shall seek an agreed resolution of the dispute or seek to agree a procedure to achieve such resolution. If within 15 days of his/her appointment he/she has failed to secure such agreement, he/she shall recommend a resolution to the dispute or a procedure to achieve such resolution and shall decide on the terms and conditions to be observed from a date which he/she shall specify until the dispute is resolved.\n3.   The Parties and the entities under their control or jurisdiction shall respect recommendations made under paragraph 2 on the terms and conditions for three months following the conciliator's decision or until resolution of the dispute, whichever is earlier.\n4.   The conciliator shall respect the Code of Conduct set out in Annex XXI to this Agreement.\nArticle 253\nNotification of the ruling of the arbitration panel\n1.   The arbitration panel shall notify its final ruling to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, within 120 days from the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. Where it considers that this deadline cannot be met, the chairperson of the arbitration panel shall notify the Parties and the Association Committee in Trade configuration in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the panel plans to notify its ruling. Under no circumstances should the ruling be notified later than 150 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration panel.\n2.   In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods or seasonal goods or services, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to notify its ruling within 60 days from the date of its establishment. Under no circumstances should the ruling be notified later than 75 days after the date of its establishment.\n3.   In respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related Energy) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, the arbitration panel shall notify its ruling within 40 days from the date of its establishment.\nSub-section 2\nCompliance\nArticle 254\nCompliance with the arbitration panel ruling\nThe Party complained against shall take any measure necessary to comply promptly and in good faith with the arbitration panel ruling.\nArticle 255\nReasonable period of time for compliance\n1.   If immediate compliance is not possible, the Parties shall endeavour to agree on the period of time to comply with the ruling. In such a case, the Party complained against shall, no later than 30 days after the receipt of the notification of the arbitration panel ruling to the Parties, notify the complaining Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, of the time it will require for compliance (‘reasonable period of time’).\n2.   If there is disagreement between the Parties on the reasonable period of time to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, the complaining Party shall, within 20 days of the date of receipt of the notification made under paragraph 1 by the Party complained against, request in writing the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration. The original arbitration panel shall notify its ruling to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 20 days from the date of submission of the request.\n3.   The Party complained against shall inform the complaining Party in writing of its progress to comply with the arbitration panel ruling at least one month before the expiry of the reasonable period of time.\n4.   The reasonable period of time may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.\nArticle 256\nReview of any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, before the end of the reasonable period of time of any measure that it has taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling.\n2.   In the event that there is disagreement between the Parties concerning the existence or the consistency of any measure under paragraph 1, taken to comply with the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, the complaining Party may request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall identify the specific measure at issue and explain how such measure is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, in a manner sufficient to present the legal basis for the complaint clearly. The original arbitration panel shall notify its ruling to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 45 days of the date of submission of the request.\nArticle 257\nTemporary remedies in case of non-compliance\n1.   If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the arbitration panel rules that no measure taken to comply exists or that the measure notified under Article 256(1) of this Agreement, is inconsistent with that Party's obligations under the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party and after consultations with that Party, present an offer for temporary compensation.\n2.   If the complaining Party decides not to request an offer for temporary compensation under paragraph 1 of this Article, or, in case such request is made, if no agreement on compensation is reached within 30 days after the end of the reasonable period of time or of the notification of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 256 of this Agreement that no measure taken to comply exists or that a measure taken to comply is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, to suspend obligations arising from any provision referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, at an adequate level, equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. The notification shall specify the level of suspension of obligations. The complaining Party may implement the suspension at any moment after the expiry of ten days after the date of receipt of the notification by the Party complained against, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph 4 of this Article.\n3.   In suspending obligations, the complaining Party may choose to increase its tariff rates to the level applied to other WTO Members on a volume of trade to be determined in such a way that the volume of trade multiplied by the increase of the tariff rates equals the value of the nullification or impairment caused by the violation.\n4.   If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation, it may request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the complaining Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration before the expiry of the ten day period referred to in paragraph 2. The original arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of obligations to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 30 days of the date of submission of the request. Obligations shall not be suspended until the original arbitration panel has notified its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the arbitration panel ruling.\n5.   The suspension of obligations and the compensation foreseen in this Article shall be temporary and shall not be applied after:\n(a)\nthe Parties have reached a mutually agreed solution pursuant to Article 262 of this Agreement; or\n(b)\nthe Parties have agreed that the measure notified under Article 256(1) of this Agreement brings the Party complained against into conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement; or\n(c)\nany measure found to be inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 245 has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with those provisions, as ruled under Article 256(2) of this Agreement.\nArticle 258\nRemedies for urgent energy disputes\n1.   In respect of a dispute concerning Chapter 11 (Trade-related Energy) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement which a Party considers to be urgent because of an interruption, in full or in part, of any transport of natural gas, oil, or electricity or a threat thereof between the Parties, the provisions of this Article on remedies shall apply.\n2.   By way of derogation from Articles 255, 256 and 257 of this Agreement, the complaining Party may suspend obligations arising under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement to an adequate level, equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the Party failing to bring itself into compliance with the arbitration panel ruling within 15 days of its notification. That suspension may take effect immediately. Such suspension may be maintained as long as the Party complained against has not complied with the arbitration panel ruling.\n3.   Should the Party complained against dispute the existence of a failure to comply or the level of the suspension due to the failure to comply, it may initiate proceedings under Articles 257(4) and 259 of this Agreement which shall be examined expeditiously. The complaining Party shall be required to remove or adjust the suspension only once the Panel has ruled on the matter, and may maintain the suspension pending the proceedings.\nArticle 259\nReview of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies for non-compliance\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, of the measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel following the suspension of concessions or following the application of temporary compensation, as the case may be. With the exception of cases under paragraph 2 of this Article, the complaining Party shall terminate the suspension of concessions within 30 days from the receipt of the notification. In cases where compensation has been applied, and with the exception of cases under paragraph 2 of this Article, the Party complained against may terminate the application of such compensation within 30 days from its notification that it has complied with the ruling of the arbitration panel.\n2.   If the Parties do not reach an agreement on whether the notified measure brings the Party complained against into conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notification, the complaining Party shall request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such a request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration within 45 days of the date of submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that the measure taken to comply is in accordance with the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, the suspension of obligations or compensation, as the case may be, shall be terminated. Where relevant, the complaining Party shall adapt the level of suspension of concessions to the level determined by the arbitration panel.\nArticle 260\nReplacement of arbitrators\nIf in an arbitration proceeding under this Chapter, the original panel, or some of its members, are unable to participate, withdraw, or need to be replaced because they do not comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct set out in Annex XXI to this Agreement, the procedure set out in Article 249 of this Agreement shall apply. The time-limit for the notification of the arbitration panel ruling shall be extended by 20 days with the exception of the urgent disputes referred to in paragraph 7 of Article 249, for which the time-limit shall be extended by five days.\nSub-section 3\nCommon provisions\nArticle 261\nSuspension and termination of arbitration and compliance procedures\nThe arbitration panel shall, at the written request of both Parties, suspend its work at any time for a period agreed by the Parties not exceeding 12 consecutive months. The arbitration panel shall resume its work before the end of that period at the written request of both Parties or at the end of this period at the written request of any Party. The requesting Party shall inform the chair or co-chairs of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, and the other Party, accordingly. If a Party does not request the resumption of the arbitration panel's work at the expiry of the agreed suspension period, the procedure shall be terminated. The suspension and termination of the arbitration panel's work are without prejudice to the rights of either Party in another proceeding subject to Article 269 of this Agreement.\nArticle 262\nMutually agreed solution\nThe Parties may reach a mutually agreed solution to a dispute under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement at any time. They shall jointly notify the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, and the chairperson of the arbitration panel, where applicable, of any such solution. If the solution requires approval pursuant to the relevant domestic procedures of either Party, the notification shall refer to this requirement, and the dispute settlement procedure shall be suspended. If such approval is not required, or if the completion of any such domestic procedures is notified, the dispute settlement procedure shall be terminated.\nArticle 263\nRules of procedure\n1.   Dispute settlement procedures under this Chapter shall be governed by the Rules of Procedure set out in Annex XX to this Agreement and by the Code of Conduct set out in Annex XXI to this Agreement.\n2.   Any hearing of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public unless otherwise provided for in the Rules of Procedure.\nArticle 264\nInformation and technical advice\nAt the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the arbitration panel may obtain any information it deems appropriate for the arbitration panel proceeding from any source, including the Parties involved in the dispute. The arbitration panel also has the right to seek the opinion of experts as it deems appropriate. The arbitration panel shall consult the Parties before choosing such experts. Natural or legal persons established in the territory of a Party may submit amicus curiae briefs to the arbitration panel in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. Any information obtained under this Article shall be disclosed to each of the Parties and submitted for their comments.\nArticle 265\nRules of interpretation\nThe arbitration panel shall interpret the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement, in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including those codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969. The panel shall also take into account relevant interpretations established in reports of panels and the Appellate Body adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The rulings of the arbitration panel cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties provided under this Agreement.\nArticle 266\nDecisions and rulings of the arbitration panel\n1.   The arbitration panel shall make every effort to take any decision by consensus. Where, nevertheless, a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter at issue shall be decided by majority vote. The deliberations of the panel shall be confidential and dissenting opinions shall not be issued.\n2.   The rulings of the arbitration panel shall be unconditionally accepted by the Parties. They shall not create any rights or obligations for natural or legal persons. The rulings shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that they make. The Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, shall make the rulings of the arbitration panel publicly available in their entirety within ten days of their notification, unless it decides not to do so in order to ensure the confidentiality of information that is designated as confidential by the Party that provided it, on the basis of its legislation.\nArticle 267\nReferrals to the Court of Justice of the European Union\n1.   The procedures set out in this Article shall apply to disputes concerning the interpretation and application of a provision of this Agreement which imposes upon a Party an obligation defined by reference to a provision of Union law.\n2.   Where a dispute raises a question of interpretation of a provision of Union law referred to in paragraph 1, the arbitration panel shall not decide the question, but request the Court of Justice of the European Union to give a ruling on the question. In such cases, the deadlines applying to the rulings of the arbitration panel shall be suspended until the Court of Justice of the European Union has given its ruling. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be binding on the arbitration panel.\nSection 4\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 268\nLists of arbitrators\n1.   The Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, shall, no later than six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, establish a list of at least 15 individuals who are willing and able to serve as arbitrators. The list shall be composed of three sub-lists: one sub-list for each Party and one sub-list of individuals that are not nationals of either Party and who may serve as chairperson to the arbitration panel. Each sub-list shall include at least five individuals. The Association Committee in Trade configuration shall ensure that the list is always maintained at that level.\n2.   Arbitrators shall have specialised knowledge and experience of law and international trade. They shall be independent, serve in their individual capacities and not take instructions from any organisation or government, or be affiliated with the government of any of the Parties, and shall comply with the Code of Conduct set out in Annex XXI to this Agreement.\n3.   The Association Committee in Trade configuration may establish additional lists of 12 individuals with knowledge and experience in specific sectors covered by this Agreement. Subject to the agreement of the Parties, such additional lists shall be used to compose the arbitration panel in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 249 of this Agreement.\nArticle 269\nRelation with WTO obligations\n1.   Recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall be without prejudice to any action in the WTO framework, including dispute settlement proceedings.\n2.   However, where a Party has, with regard to a particular measure, initiated a dispute settlement proceeding, either under this Chapter or under the WTO Agreement, it may not institute a dispute settlement proceeding regarding the same measure in the other forum until the first proceeding has been concluded. In addition, a Party shall not seek redress of an obligation which is identical under this Agreement and under the WTO Agreement in the two fora. In such case, once a dispute settlement proceeding has been initiated, the Parties shall use the selected forum to the exclusion of the other, unless the forum selected fails for procedural or jurisdictional reasons to make findings on the claim seeking redress of that obligation.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article:\n(a)\ndispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for the establishment of a panel under Article 6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes contained in Annex 2 to the WTO Agreement (DSU) and are deemed to be concluded when the DSB adopts that panel's report, and the Appellate Body's report as the case may be, under Articles 16 and 17.14 of the DSU; and\n(b)\ndispute settlement proceedings under this Chapter are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for the establishment of an arbitration panel under Article 248 of this Agreement and are deemed to be concluded when the arbitration panel notifies its ruling under Article 253 of this Agreement to the Parties and to the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement.\n4.   Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from implementing the suspension of obligations authorised by the DSB. The WTO Agreement shall not be invoked to preclude a Party from suspending obligations under this Chapter.\nArticle 270\nTime-limits\n1.   All time-limits laid down in this Chapter, including the time-limits for an arbitration panel to notify its ruling, shall be counted in calendar days from the day following the act or fact to which they refer, unless otherwise specified.\n2.   Any time-limit referred to in this Chapter may be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties to the dispute. The arbitration panel may at any time propose to the Parties to modify any time-limit referred to in this Chapter, stating the reasons for that proposal.\nCHAPTER 15\nGeneral provisions on approximation under title iv\nArticle 271\nProgress in approximation in trade-related areas\n1.   For the purposes of facilitating the assessment of the approximation, referred to in Article 419 of this Agreement, of Georgian law to Union law in the trade-related areas of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement, the Parties shall regularly, and at least once a year, discuss the progress in approximation according to the agreed timeframes provided for in Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement in the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, or one of its Sub-Committees established under this Agreement.\n2.   Upon request by the Union, and for the purposes of such discussion, Georgia shall submit to the Association Committee in Trade configuration or one of its Sub-Committees, as appropriate, information in writing on progress in approximation and on the effective implementation and enforcement of approximated domestic law, in relation to the relevant Chapters of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement.\n3.   Georgia shall inform the Union when it considers that it has completed the approximation provided for in any of the Chapters referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 272\nRepeal of inconsistent domestic law\nAs part of the approximation, Georgia shall repeal provisions of its domestic law or remove administrative practices which are inconsistent with Union law that is the object of approximation provisions under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement or with its domestic law approximated to the Union law accordingly.\nArticle 273\nAssessment of approximation in trade-related areas\n1.   The assessment of approximation by the Union referred to in Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement shall start after Georgia has informed the Union pursuant to Article 271(3) of this Agreement, unless otherwise provided for in Chapters 4 and 8 of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement.\n2.   The Union shall assess whether the law of Georgia has been approximated to Union law and whether it is implemented and enforced effectively. Georgia shall provide the Union with all necessary information to enable such assessment, in a language to be mutually agreed.\n3.   The assessment by the Union pursuant to paragraph 2 shall take into account the existence and operation of relevant infrastructure, bodies and procedures in Georgia necessary for the effective implementation and enforcement of the law of Georgia.\n4.   The assessment by the Union pursuant to paragraph 2 shall take account of the existence of any provisions of domestic law or administrative practices that are inconsistent with Union law that is the object of approximation provisions under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement or with the domestic law approximated to the Union law accordingly.\n5.   The Union shall inform Georgia within a timeframe to be determined in accordance with Article 276(1) of this Agreement about the results of its assessment, unless otherwise provided. The Parties may discuss the assessment in the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, or its relevant Sub-Committees in accordance with Article 419(4) of this Agreement, unless otherwise provided.\nArticle 274\nDevelopments relevant to approximation\n1.   Georgia shall ensure the effective implementation of the domestic law approximated under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement and undertake any action necessary to reflect the developments in Union law in its domestic law, in accordance with Article 418 of this Agreement.\n2.   The Union shall inform Georgia about any final Commission proposals to adopt or amend Union law relevant to approximation obligations incumbent on Georgia under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement.\n3.   Georgia shall inform the Union of actions, including legislative proposals and administrative practices, which may affect the fulfilment of its approximation obligations under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement.\n4.   Upon request, the Parties shall discuss the impact of any proposals or actions referred to under paragraphs 2 and 3 on the law of Georgia or on the compliance with the obligations under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement.\n5.

Principles:\n(a)\nequivalence can be determined for an individual measure, a group of measures or a system related to a certain commodity or a category of commodities or all of them;\n(b)\nthe examination by the importing Party of a request for recognition of equivalence of measures pertaining to a certain commodity of the exporting Party shall not be a reason to disrupt trade or suspend on-going imports from the exporting Party of the commodity in question;\n(c)\nthe process of recognition of equivalence is an interactive process between the exporting Party and the importing Party. The process consists of an objective demonstration of equivalence of individual measures by the exporting Party and an objective assessment of the equivalence with a view to the possible recognition of equivalence by the importing Party;\n(d)\nthe final recognition of equivalence of the relevant measures of the exporting Party rests solely with the importing Party.\n2.   Preconditions:\n(a)\nthe process depends on the health or pest status, the law and the effectiveness of the inspection and control system related to the commodity in the exporting Party. To this end the law in the sector concerned shall be taken into account, as well as the structure of the competent authority of the exporting Party, the command chain, the authority, the operational procedures and resources, and the effectiveness of the competent authorities as regards inspection and control systems, including the level of enforcement related to the commodity and the regularity and the rapidity of information flow to the importing Party in case of identified hazards. This recognition may be supported by documentation, verification and document, reports and information related to past experiences, assessments and verifications earlier documented;\n(b)\nthe Parties shall initiate the process of recognition of equivalence pursuant to Article 57 of this Agreement after the successful completion of the approximation of a measure, a group of measures or a system included in the approximation list set out in Article 55(4) of this Agreement;\n(c)\nthe exporting Party shall initiate the process only when no safeguard measures imposed by the importing Party apply to the exporting Party as regards the commodity.\n3.   The process:\n(a)\nthe exporting Party initiates the process by submitting to the importing Party a request for recognition of equivalence of an individual measure or a group of measures or a system for a commodity or a category of commodities in a sector or sub-sector or all of them;\n(b)\nwhen appropriate, this request includes also the request and the required documentation for approval by the importing Party on the basis of equivalence of any programme or plan of the exporting Party required by the importing Party and/or the status of approximation as laid down in Annex XI of this Agreement regarding the measures or systems described in point (a) of this paragraph as a condition for allowing import of that commodity or a categories of commodities;\n(c)\nwith this request, the exporting Party:\n(i)\nexplains the importance for trade of that commodity or categories of commodities;\n(ii)\nidentifies the individual measure(s) with which it can comply from all the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party applicable to that commodity or category of commodities;\n(iii)\nidentifies the individual measure(s) for which it seeks equivalence out of the total of the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party, applicable to that commodity or categories of commodities;\n(d)\nin reply to this request the importing Party explains the overall and individual objective and the rationale behind its measure(s), including the identification of the risk;\n(e)\nwith this explanation, the importing Party informs the exporting Party on the relationship of its domestic measures and the import conditions for that commodity or categories of commodities;\n(f)\nthe exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that the measures that it has identified are equivalent to the import conditions for that commodity or category of commodities;\n(g)\nthe importing Party objectively assesses the demonstration of equivalence by the exporting Party;\n(h)\nthe importing Party concludes whether equivalence is achieved or not;\n(i)\nthe importing Party provides to the exporting Party full explanation and supporting data for its determination and decision if so required by the exporting Party.\n4.   Demonstration of equivalence of measures by the exporting party and assessment of this demonstration by the importing Party:\n(a)\nthe exporting Party shall objectively demonstrate equivalence for each of the identified measures of the importing Party expressed in its import conditions. When appropriate, equivalence shall objectively be demonstrated for any plan or program required by the importing Party as a condition to allow import (e.g. residue plan, etc.);\n(b)\nobjective demonstration and assessment in this context should be based, as far as possible, on:\n(i)\ninternationally recognised standards; and/or\n(ii)\nstandards based on proper scientific evidence; and/or\n(iii)\nrisk assessment; and/or\n(iv)\ndocuments, reports and information related to past experiences, assessments and/or\n(v)\nverifications; and\n(vi)\nlegal status or level of administrative status of the measures; and\n(vii)\nlevel of implementation and enforcement on the basis of, in particular:\n—\ncorresponding and relevant results of surveillance and monitoring programmes;\n—\ninspection results of the exporting Party;\n—\nresults of analysis with recognised analysis methods;\n—\nverification and import check results by the importing Party;\n—\nthe performance of the competent authorities of the exporting Party; and\n—\nearlier experiences.\n5.   Conclusion of the importing Party\nThe process may include an inspection or verification;\nIn case the importing Party arrives at a negative conclusion, it shall provide the exporting Party with a detailed and reasoned explanation.\n6.   For plants and plant products, equivalence concerning phytosanitary measures, shall be based on the conditions referred to in Article 57(6) of this Agreement.\nANNEX IX\nIMPORT CHECKS AND INSPECTION FEES\nA.   Principles of import checks\nImport checks consist of documentary checks, identity checks and physical checks.\nAs regards animals and animal products, the physical checks and their frequency shall be based on the level of the risk associated with such imports.\nIn carrying out the checks for plant health purposes, the importing Party shall ensure that the plants, plant products and other objects shall be meticulously inspected on an official basis, either in their entirety or by inspecting a representative sample, in order to make sure, that they are not contaminated by pests.\nIn the event that the checks reveal non-conformity with the relevant standards and/or requirements, the importing Party shall take measures proportionate to the risk involved. Wherever possible, the importer or his representative shall be given access to the consignment and the opportunity to provide any relevant information to assist the importing Party in taking a final decision concerning the consignment. Such decision shall be proportional to the level of the risk associated with such imports.\nB.   Frequencies of physical checks\nB.1.

Principles of certification\nPlants and plant products and other objects:\nIn respect of certification of plants and plant products and other objects, the competent authorities shall apply the principles laid down in the relevant ISPMs.\nAnimals and animal products:\n1.\nThe competent authorities of the Parties shall ensure that certifying officers have a satisfactory knowledge of the veterinary law as regards the animals or animal products to be certified and, in general, are informed about the rules to be followed for drawing up and issuing of the certificates and, if necessary, as to the nature and extent of the enquiries, tests or examinations which should be carried out before certification.\n2.\nCertifying officers must not certify data of which they have no personal knowledge or which cannot be ascertained by them.\n3.\nCertifying officers must not sign blank or incomplete certificates, or certificates relating to animals or animal products, which they have not inspected or which have passed out of their control. Where a certificate is signed on the basis of another certificate or attestation, the certifying officer shall be in possession of the latter document before signing.\n4.\nA certifying officer may certify data which have been:\n(a)\nascertained on the basis of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Annex by another person authorised by the competent authority and acting under the control of the latter authority, provided that the certifying officer can verify the accuracy of the data; or\n(b)\nobtained, within the context of monitoring programmes, by reference to officially recognised quality assurance schemes or by means of an epidemiological surveillance system where this is authorised under the relevant veterinary law.\n5.\nThe competent authorities of the Parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure the integrity of certification. In particular they shall ensure that certifying officers designated by them:\n(a)\nhave a status which ensures their impartiality and have no direct commercial interest in the animals or products being certified or in the holdings or establishments in which they originate; and\n(b)\nare fully aware of the significance of the contents of each certificate which they sign.\n6.\nCertificates shall be drawn up in order to ensure that a specific certificate refers to a specific consignment in a language understood by the certifying officer and in at least one of the official languages of the importing Party as set out in Part C of this Annex.\n7.\nEach competent authority shall be in a position to link a certificate with the relevant certifying officer and ensure that a copy of all certificates issued is available for a period to be determined by that competent authority.\n8.\nEach Party shall introduce the checks and the controls necessary to prevent the issuing of false or misleading certifications and the fraudulent use of certificates purported to be issued for the purposes set out in the veterinary law.\n9.\nWithout prejudice to any judicial proceedings or penalties, the competent authorities shall carry out investigations or checks and take appropriate measures to penalise any instances of false or misleading certification, which are brought to their attention. Such measures may include the temporary suspension of the certifying officers from their duties until the investigation is over. In particular:\n(a)\nif in the course of the checks it is found that a certifying officer has knowingly issued a fraudulent certificate, the competent authority shall take all necessary steps to ensure, as far as is possible, that the person concerned cannot repeat the offence;\n(b)\nif in the course of the checks it is found that an individual or an undertaking has made fraudulent use of or has altered an official certificate, the competent authority shall take all necessary measures to ensure, as far as possible, that the individual or the undertaking cannot repeat the offence. Such measures may include a refusal to issue an official certificate to the person or the undertaking concerned.\nB.   Certificate referred to in Article 60(2)(a) of this Agreement\nThe health attestation in the certificate reflects the status of equivalence of the commodity concerned. The health attestation states compliance with the production standards of the exporting Party recognised as equivalent by the importing Party.\nC.   Official languages for certification\n1.   Import into the European Union\nFor plants, plant products and other objects:\nThe certificates shall be drawn up in a language understood by the certifying officer and in at least one of the official languages of the importing Party.\nFor animals and animal products:\nThe health certificate must be drawn up in at least one of the official languages of the EU Member State of destination and in one of those of the EU Member State in which the import checks provided for in Article 63 of this Agreement are carried out. However, an EU Member State may consent to the use of an official Union language other than its own.\n2.   Import into Georgia\nThe health certificate must be drawn up in Georgian, and in at least one of the official languages of the certifying EU Member State.\nANNEX XI\nAPPROXIMATION\nANNEX XI-A\nPRINCIPLES FOR THE EVALUATION OF PROGRESS IN THE APPROXIMATION PROCESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECOGNITION OF EQUIVALENCE\nPART I\nGradual approximation\n1.   General rules\nThe sanitary, phytosanitary and animal welfare law of Georgia shall be gradually approximated to that of the Union, based on the approximation list of the EU sanitary, phytosanitary and animal welfare law. That list shall be divided into priority areas that relate to measures, as defined in Annex IV to this Agreement. For this reason Georgia shall identify its trade priority areas.\nGeorgia shall approximate domestic rules to the EU acquis by either:\n(a)\nimplementing and enforcing through the adoption of additional domestic rules or procedures the rules in relevant EU acquis, or\n(b)\nby amending relevant domestic rules or procedures to incorporate the rules in relevant EU acquis.\nIn either case, Georgia shall:\n(a)\neliminate any laws, regulations or any other measures inconsistent with the approximated domestic legislation;\n(b)\nensure the effective implementation of approximated domestic legislation.\nGeorgia shall document such approximation in tables of correspondence according to a model indicating the date on which domestic rules enter into force and the official journal in which the rules were published.

Provision of legal services is only authorised in respect of public international law, EU law and the law of any jurisdiction where the service supplier or its personnel is qualified to practice as a lawyer, and, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing requirements and procedures applicable in the Member States of the EU. For lawyers providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures may take, inter alia, the form of compliance with local codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance requirements, simple registration with the host country Bar or a simplified admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional domicile in the host country.

Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the EU might therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the Union since it involves practice of EU and national procedural law.

preventing and rapidly reacting to an emergency situation or to a threat of an emergency situation. It foresees an early evaluation of potential risks and problems related to the supply and demand of natural gas, oil or electricity and the prevention and rapid reaction in case of an emergency situation or a threat of an emergency situation.\n2.\nFor the purposes of this Annex, an emergency situation is a situation causing a significant disruption or a physical interruption of supply of energy goods between Georgia and the Union.\n3.\nFor the purposes of this Annex the Coordinators are the relevant Minister of the Government of Georgia and the Member of the European Commission in charge of energy.\n4.\nRegular evaluations of potential risks and problems related to the supply and demand of energy materials and products should be undertaken jointly by the Parties to this Agreement and should be reported to the Coordinators.\n5.\nShould one of the Parties to this Agreement become aware of an emergency situation or of a situation which, in its opinion, could lead to an emergency situation, that Party shall inform without delay the other Party.\n6.\nUnder the circumstances set out in paragraph 5, the Coordinators shall notify each other, within the shortest possible time, of the necessity to initiate the Early Warning Mechanism. The notification shall indicate, inter alia, designated persons that are authorised by the Coordinators to maintain permanent contact with each other.\n7.\nUpon notification in accordance with paragraph 6, each Party shall provide the other Party with its own assessment. Such an assessment shall include an estimate of the timeframe within which the threat of an emergency situation or the emergency situation could be eliminated. The Parties shall react promptly to the assessment provided by the other Party and complement it with available additional information.\n8.\nIf one Party is unable to adequately assess or accept the other Party's assessment of the situation, or the estimated timeframe within which a threat of an emergency situation or an emergency situation may be eliminated, the corresponding Coordinator may request consultations, which shall commence within a time period not exceeding three days from the moment of forwarding the notification foreseen in paragraph 6. Such consultations shall take place through an Experts Group consisting of representatives authorised by the Coordinators. The consultations shall aim at:\n(a)\nelaborating a common evaluation of the situation and of possible further developments;\n(b)\nelaborating recommendations to prevent or eliminate the threat of an emergency situation or to overcome the emergency situation and\n(c)\nelaborating recommendations on a joint action plan with regard to the actions provided in points( a) and (b) of paragraph 8 of this Annex in order to minimise the impact of an emergency situation and, if possible, to overcome the emergency situation, including the possibility of establishing a Special Monitoring Group.\n9.\nThe consultations, common evaluations and proposed recommendations shall be based on the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality.\n10.\nThe Coordinators, within their competencies, shall work to eliminate the threat of an emergency situation or to overcome the emergency situation taking into account the recommendations that have been elaborated as the result of the consultations.\n11.\nThe Experts Group referred to in paragraph 8 shall report on its activities to the Coordinators promptly after the implementation of any agreed plan of action.\n12.\nIf an emergency situation occurs, the Coordinators may establish a Special Monitoring Group with the task of examining the on-going circumstances and further developments and keeping an objective record of them. The Group may consist of:\n(a)\nrepresentatives of the Parties;\n(b)\nrepresentatives of energy companies of the Parties;\n(c)\nrepresentatives of international energy organisations, proposed and mutually approved by the Parties, and\n(d)\nindependent experts proposed and mutually approved by the Parties.\n13.\nThe Special Monitoring Group shall start its work without delay and shall operate, as necessary, until the emergency situation has been solved. A decision on the termination of the work of the Special Monitoring Group shall be taken jointly by the Coordinators.\n14.\nFrom the time at which a Party informs the other Party of the circumstances described in paragraph 5, and until the completion of the procedures set out in this Annex and the prevention or elimination of the threat of an emergency situation or the resolution of the emergency situation, each Party shall do its utmost within the scope of its competence to minimise any negative consequences for the other Party. The Parties shall cooperate with the aim to reach an immediate solution in a spirit of transparency. The Parties shall refrain from any actions unrelated to the on-going emergency situation that could create or deepen the negative consequences for the supply of natural gas, oil or electricity between Georgia and the Union.\n15.\nEach Party independently carries the costs relating to the actions in the framework of this Annex.\n16.\nThe Parties shall maintain in confidence all information exchanged between them that is designated as being of a confidential nature. The Parties shall take any necessary measures to protect confidential information on the basis of the relevant legal and normative acts of Georgia, or of the Union, as well as in accordance with applicable international agreements and conventions.\n17.\nThe Parties may, by mutual agreement, invite representatives of third parties to take part in the consultations or monitoring referred to in paragraphs 8 and 12.\n18.\nThe Parties may agree to adapt the provisions of this Annex in view of establishing an early warning mechanism between them and other Parties.\n19.\nA violation of the provisions in this Annex cannot serve as a basis for dispute settlement procedures under Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement or any other agreement applicable to disputes between the Parties. Moreover, a Party shall not rely on or introduce as evidence in such dispute settlement procedures:\n(a)\npositions taken or proposals made by the other Party in the course of the procedure set out in this Annex, or\n(b)\nthe fact that the other Party has indicated its willingness to accept a solution to the emergency situation subject to this mechanism.\nANNEX XIX\nMEDIATION MECHANISM\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThe objective of this Annex is to facilitate the finding of a mutually agreed solution through a comprehensive and expeditious procedure with the assistance of a mediator.\nSECTION 1\nPROCEDURE UNDER THE MEDIATION MECHANISM\nArticle 2\nRequest for information\n1.   Before the initiation of the mediation procedure, a Party may request at any time in writing information regarding a measure adversely affecting its trade interests. The Party to which such request is made shall provide, within 20 days, a written response containing its comments on the information contained in the request.\n2.   Where the responding Party considers that a response within 20 days is not practicable, it shall inform the requesting Party of the reasons for the delay, together with an estimate of the shortest period within which it will be able to provide its response.\nArticle 3\nInitiation of the procedure\n1.   A Party may request, at any time, that the Parties enter into a mediation procedure. Such request shall be addressed to the other Party in writing. The request shall be sufficiently detailed to present clearly the concerns of the requesting Party and shall:\n(a)\nidentify the specific measure at issue;\n(b)\nprovide a statement of the alleged adverse effects that the requesting Party believes the measure has, or will have, on its trade interests, and\n(c)\nexplain how the requesting Party considers that those effects are linked to the measure.\n2.   The mediation procedure may only be initiated by mutual agreement of the Parties. The Party to which a request pursuant to paragraph 1 is addressed shall give sympathetic consideration to the request and reply by accepting or rejecting it in writing within ten days of its receipt.\nArticle 4\nSelection of the mediator\n1.   Upon launch of the mediation procedure, the Parties shall endeavour to agree on a mediator no later than 15 days after the receipt of the reply to the request referred to in Article 3 of this Annex.\n2.   In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on the mediator within the time frame laid down in paragraph 1, either Party may request the chair or co-chairs of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, or their delegates, to select the mediator by lot from the list established under Article 268 of this Agreement. Representatives of both Parties shall be invited, with sufficient advance notice, to be present when lots are drawn. In any event, the lot shall be carried out with the Party/Parties that are present.\n3.   The chair or co-chairs of the Association Committee in Trade configuration, or their delegates, shall select the mediator within five working days of the request made by either Party under paragraph 2 of this Article.\n4.   Should the list provided for in Article 268 of this Agreement not be established at the time a request is made pursuant to Article 3 of this Annex, the mediator shall be drawn by lot from the individuals which have been formally proposed by one or both of the Parties.\n5.   A mediator shall not be a citizen of either Party, unless the Parties agree otherwise.\n6.   The mediator shall assist, in an impartial and transparent manner, the Parties in bringing clarity to the measure and its possible trade effects, and in reaching a mutually agreed solution. The Code of Conduct for Arbitrators and Mediators set out in Annex XXI to this Agreement shall apply to mediators, mutatis mutandis. Rules 3 through 7 (notifications) and 41 through 45 (translation and interpretation) of the Rules of Procedure of Annex XX to this Agreement shall also apply, mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 5\nRules of the mediation procedure\n1.   Within ten days after the appointment of the mediator, the Party having invoked the mediation procedure shall present, in writing, a detailed description of the problem to the mediator and to the other Party, in particular of the operation of the measure at issue and its trade effects. Within 20 days after the date of delivery of this submission, the other Party may provide, in writing, its comments to the description of the problem. Either Party may include in its description or comments any information that it deems relevant.\n2.   The mediator may decide on the most appropriate way of bringing clarity to the measure concerned and its possible trade effects. In particular, the mediator may organise meetings between the Parties, consult the Parties jointly or individually, seek the assistance of, or consult with, relevant experts and stakeholders and provide any additional support requested by the Parties. However, before seeking the assistance of or consulting with relevant experts and stakeholders, the mediator shall consult with the Parties.\n3.   The mediator may offer advice and propose a solution for the consideration of the Parties which may accept or reject the proposed solution or may agree on a different solution. However, the mediator shall not advise or give comments on the consistency of the measure at issue with this Agreement.\n4.   The procedure shall take place in the territory of the Party to which the request was addressed, or by mutual agreement in any other location or by any other means.\n5.   The Parties shall endeavour to reach a mutually agreed solution within 60 days from the appointment of the mediator. Pending a final agreement, the Parties may consider possible interim solutions, especially if the measure relates to perishable goods.\n6.   The solution may be adopted by means of a decision of the Association Committee in Trade configuration as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement. Either Party may make such solution subject to the completion of any necessary internal procedures. Mutually agreed solutions shall be made publicly available. The version disclosed to the public may not contain any information that a Party has designated as confidential.\n7.   On request of the Parties, the mediator shall notify to the Parties, in writing, a draft factual report, providing a brief summary of (a) the measure at issue in these procedures; (b) the procedures followed; and (c) any mutually agreed solution reached as the final outcome of these procedures, including possible interim solutions. The mediator shall provide the Parties 15 days to comment on the draft report. After considering the comments of the Parties submitted within the period, the mediator shall submit, in writing, a final factual report to the Parties within 15 days. The factual report shall not include any interpretation of this Agreement.\n8.   The procedure shall be terminated:\n(a)\nby the adoption of a mutually agreed solution by the Parties, on the date of the adoption thereof;\n(b)\nby a mutual agreement of the Parties at any stage of the procedure, on the date of that agreement;\n(c)\nby a written declaration of the mediator, after consultation with the Parties, that further efforts at mediation would be to no avail, on the date of that declaration, or\n(d)\nby a written declaration of a Party after exploring mutually agreed solutions under the mediation procedure and after having considered any advice and proposed solutions by the mediator, on the date of that declaration.\nSECTION 2\nIMPLEMENTATION\nArticle 6\nImplementation of a mutually agreed solution\n1.   Where the Parties have agreed to a solution, each Party shall take the measures necessary to implement the mutually agreed solution within the agreed timeframe.\n2.   The implementing Party shall inform the other Party in writing of any steps or measures taken to implement the mutually agreed solution.\nSECTION 3\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 7\nConfidentiality and relationship to dispute settlement\n1.   Unless the Parties agree otherwise, and without prejudice to Article 5(6) of this Annex, all steps of the procedure, including any advice or proposed solution, are confidential. However, any Party may disclose to the public that mediation is taking place.\n2.   The mediation procedure is without prejudice to the Parties' rights and obligations under the provisions on Dispute Settlement of Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement or any other agreement.\n3.   Consultations under Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement are not required before initiating the mediation procedure. However, a Party should normally avail itself of the other available cooperation or consultation provisions in this Agreement before initiating the mediation procedure.\n4.   A Party shall not rely on or introduce as evidence in other dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement or any other agreement, nor shall a panel take into consideration:\n(a)\npositions taken by the other Party in the course of the mediation procedure or information gathered under Article 5(1) and (2) of this Annex;\n(b)\nthe fact that the other Party has indicated its willingness to accept a solution to the measure subject to mediation or\n(c)\nadvice given or proposals made by the mediator.\n5.   A mediator may not serve as a panellist in a dispute settlement proceeding under this Agreement or under the WTO Agreement involving the same matter for which he/she has been a mediator.\nArticle 8\nTime-limits\nAny time-limit referred to in this Annex may be modified by mutual agreement between the Parties involved in these procedures.\nArticle 9\nCosts\n1.   Each Party shall bear its own expenses derived from its participation in the mediation procedure.\n2.   The Parties shall share jointly and equally the expenses derived from organisational matters, including the remuneration and expenses of the mediator. The remuneration of the mediator shall be in accordance with that foreseen for the chairperson of an arbitration panel in accordance with Rule 8(e) of the Rules of Procedure.\nANNEX XX\nRULES OF PROCEDURE FOR DISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nGeneral provisions\n1.\nIn Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement and under these Rules:\n(a)\n‘adviser’ means a person retained by a Party to the dispute to advise or assist that Party in connection with the arbitration panel proceeding;\n(b)\n‘arbitrator’ means a member of an arbitration panel established under Article 249 of this Agreement;\n(c)\n‘assistant’ means a person who, under the terms of appointment of an arbitrator, conducts research or provides assistance to that arbitrator (1);\n(d)\n‘complaining Party’ means any Party that requests the establishment of an arbitration panel under Article 248 of this Agreement;\n(e)\n‘party complained against’ means the Party that is alleged to be in violation of the provisions referred to in Article 245 of this Agreement;\n(f)\n‘arbitration panel’ means a panel established under Article 249 of this Agreement;\n(g)\n‘representative of a Party’ means an employee or any person appointed by a government department or agency or any other public entity of a Party who represents the Party for the purposes of a dispute under this Agreement;\n(h)\n‘day’ means a calendar day.\n2.\nThe Party complained against shall be in charge of the logistical administration of dispute settlement proceedings, in particular the organisation of hearings, unless otherwise agreed.

The Party complained against may, if it so chooses, be present during the lot. In any event, the lot shall be carried out with the Party/Parties that are present.\n(b)\nIf pursuant to Article 249 of this Agreement or to rules 19, 20 or 46 of these Rules an arbitrator is to be selected by lot and there are two chairpersons of the Association Committee in Trade configuration as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, the lot shall be performed by both chairpersons, or their delegates.

This information shall also be made publicly available by the Party in charge of the logistical administration of the proceedings, unless the hearing is closed to the public. Unless a Party disagrees, the arbitration panel may decide not to convene a hearing.\nThe hearing shall be open to the public, unless it must be partially or fully closed in order to ensure the confidentiality of confidential information. In addition, the Parties may, by mutual agreement, decide that the hearing be partially or fully closed to the public on the basis of other objective considerations.\n23.\nUnless the Parties agree otherwise, the hearing shall be held in Brussels, if the complaining Party is Georgia and in Tbilisi, if the complaining Party is the EU.\n24.\nThe arbitration panel may convene additional hearings, if the Parties so agree.\n25.\nAll arbitrators shall be present during the entirety of any hearings.\n26.\nThe following persons may attend the hearing, irrespective of whether the proceedings are open to the public or not:\n(a)\nrepresentatives of the Parties to the dispute;\n(b)\nadvisers to the Parties to the dispute;\n(c)\nadministrative staff, interpreters, translators and court reporters and\n(d)\narbitrators' assistants.\nOnly the representatives and advisers of the Parties to the dispute may address the arbitration panel.\n27.\nNo later than five days before the date of a hearing, each Party to the dispute shall deliver to the arbitration panel a list of the names of individuals who will make oral arguments or presentations at the hearing on behalf of that Party and of other representatives or advisers who will be attending the hearing.\n28.\nThe arbitration panel shall conduct the hearing in the following manner, ensuring that the complaining Party and the Party complained against are afforded equal time:\nArgument\n(a)\nargument of the complaining Party\n(b)\ncounter-argument of the Party complained against\nRebuttal Argument\n(a)\nargument of the complaining Party\n(b)\ncounter-argument of the Party complained against\n29.\nThe arbitration panel may direct questions to either Party to the dispute at any time during the hearing.\n30.\nThe arbitration panel shall arrange for a transcript of each hearing to be prepared and delivered as soon as possible to the Parties to the dispute.

Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:\n(a)\npreserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;\n(b)\nbreaking-up and assembly of packages;\n(c)\nwashing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;\n(d)\nironing or pressing of textiles;\n(e)\nsimple painting and polishing operations;\n(f)\nhusking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;\n(g)\noperations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps;\n(h)\npeeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;\n(i)\nsharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;\n(j)\nsifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);\n(k)\nsimple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;\n(l)\naffixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n(m)\nsimple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds;\n(n)\nmixing of sugar with any material;\n(o)\nsimple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;\n(p)\na combination of two or more operations specified in points (a) to (o);\n(q)\nslaughter of animals.\n2.   All operations carried out in a Party on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.\nArticle 7\nUnit of qualification\n1.   The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.\nIt follows that:\n(a)\nwhen a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;\n(b)\nwhen a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.\n2.   Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.\nArticle 8\nAccessories, spare parts and tools\nAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.\nArticle 9\nSets\nSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.\nArticle 10\nNeutral elements\nIn order to determine whether a product is an originating product, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:\n(a)\nenergy and fuel;\n(b)\nplant and equipment;\n(c)\nmachines and tools;\n(d)\ngoods which neither enter into the final composition of the product nor are intended to do so.\nTITLE III\nTERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS\nArticle 11\nPrinciple of territoriality\n1.   Except as provided for in Article 3 and in paragraph 3 of this Article the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall be fulfilled without interruption in a Party.\n2.   Except as provided for in Article 3, where originating goods exported from a Party to another country return, they shall be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nthe returning goods are the same as those exported, and\n(b)\nthe returning goods have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.\n3.   The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside a Party on materials exported from the Party and subsequently reimported there, provided that:\n(a)\nthe said materials are wholly obtained in the Party or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 prior to being exported;\nand\n(b)\nit can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(i)\nthe re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials, and\n(ii)\nthe total added value acquired outside the Party by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end-product for which originating status is claimed.\n4.   For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside a Party. But where, in the list in Annex II to this Protocol, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end-product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the Party by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.\n5.   For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, ‘total added value’ shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside a Party, including the value of the materials incorporated there.\n6.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfill the conditions set out in the list in Annex II to this Protocol or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 5(2) is applied.\n7.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall not apply to products of Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.\n8.   Any working or processing of the kind covered by the provisions of this Article and done outside a Party shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements.\nArticle 12\nDirect transport\n1.   The preferential treatment provided for under this Agreement shall apply only to products satisfying the requirements of this Protocol which are transported directly between the Parties or through the territory of Turkey. However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.\nOriginating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the Parties acting as exporting and importing parties.\n2.   Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing Party by the production of:\n(a)\na single transport document covering the passage from the exporting Party through the country of transit; or\n(b)\na certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:\n(i)\ngiving an exact description of the products;\n(ii)\nstating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used, and\n(iii)\ncertifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or\n(c)\nfailing these, any substantiating documents.\nArticle 13\nExhibitions\n1.   Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than a Party and sold after the exhibition for importation in a Party, shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nan exporter has consigned these products from a Party to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;\n(b)\nthe products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in a Party;\n(c)\nthe products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition, and\n(d)\nthe products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.\n2.   A proof of origin shall be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition shall be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.\nTITLE IV\nDRAWBACK OR EXEMPTION\nArticle 14\nProhibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties\n1.   Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in a Party for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in the Party to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.\n2.   The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in a Party to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there.\n3.   The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.\n4.   The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 7 paragraph 2, accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 8 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 9 when such items are non-originating.\n5.   The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which this Protocol applies.\nTITLE V\nPROOF OF ORIGIN\nArticle 15\nGeneral requirements\n1.   Products originating in a Party shall, on importation into the other Party, benefit from the provisions of this Agreement upon submission of one of the following proofs of origin:\n(a)\na movement certificate EUR.1, a specimen of which appears in Annex III to this Protocol;\n(b)\nin the cases specified in Article 21(1), a declaration (hereinafter referred to as the ‘origin declaration’) given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The text of the origin declaration appear in Annex IV to this Protocol.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, in the cases specified in Article 26, benefit from the provisions of this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the proofs of origin referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\nArticle 16\nProcedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1\n1.   A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting Party on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.\n2.   For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill in both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex III to this Protocol. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which this Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the completion of the forms is done in handwriting, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products shall be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line shall be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.\n3.   The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 5, a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Member State of the EU or of Georgia if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the EU or in Georgia or in Turkey and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n5.   The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.\n6.   The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.\n7.   A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.\nArticle 17\nMovement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively\n1.   Notwithstanding Article 16(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:\n(a)\nit was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances, or\n(b)\nit is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.\n2.   For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.\n3.   The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application complies with that in the corresponding file.\n4.   Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase in English:\n‘ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY’\n5.

The duplicate issued in this way shall be endorsed with the following word in English:\n‘DUPLICATE’\n3.   The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.\n4.   The duplicate, which shall bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.\nArticle 19\nIssue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously\nWhen originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in a Party, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within that Party. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.\nArticle 20\nAccounting segregation\n1.   Where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called ‘accounting segregation’ method (hereinafter referred to as the ‘method’) to be used for managing such stocks.\n2.   The method shall ensure that, for a specific reference period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as ‘originating’ is the same as that which would have been obtained had there been physical segregation of the stocks.\n3.   The customs authorities may make the grant of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions deemed appropriate.\n4.   The method shall be applied and the application thereof shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured.\n5.   The beneficiary of the method may make out or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.\n6.   The customs authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation and may withdraw it whenever the beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.\nArticle 21\nConditions for making out an origin declaration\n1.   An origin declaration as referred to in point (b) of Article 15(1) may be made out:\n(a)\nby an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 22, or\n(b)\nby any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products the total value of which does not exceed EUR 6 000.\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3, an origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the EU or in Georgia and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n3.   The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n4.   An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV to this Protocol, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.\n5.   Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 22 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.\n6.   An origin declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country at the latest two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.\nArticle 22\nApproved exporter\n1.   The customs authorities of the exporting Party may authorise any exporter (hereinafter referred to as ‘approved exporter’), who makes frequent shipments of products in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation shall offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.\n3.   The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.\n4.   The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.\n5.   The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.\nArticle 23\nValidity of proof of origin\n1.   A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting Party, and shall be submitted within that period to the customs authorities of the importing Party.\n2.   Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.\n3.   In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.\nArticle 24\nSubmission of proof of origin\nProofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this Agreement.\nArticle 25\nImportation by instalments\nWhere, at the request of the importer and subject to the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.\nArticle 26\nExemptions from proof of origin\n1.   Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, that declaration may be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.\n2.   Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.\n3.   Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.\nArticle 27\nSupporting documents\nThe documents referred to in Article 16(3) and Article 21(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an origin declaration may be considered as products originating in a Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist inter alia of the following:\n(a)\ndirect evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal bookkeeping;\n(b)\ndocuments proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the relevant Party where these documents are used in accordance with national law;\n(c)\ndocuments proving the working or processing of materials in the relevant Party, issued or made out in the relevant Party, where these documents are used in accordance with national law;\n(d)\nmovement certificates EUR.1 or origin declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the relevant Party in accordance with this Protocol;\n(e)\nappropriate evidence concerning working or processing undergone outside the relevant Party by application of Article 11, proving that the requirements of that Article have been satisfied.\nArticle 28\nPreservation of proof of origin and supporting documents\n1.   The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the documents referred to in Article 16(3).\n2.

The customs authorities of the importing Party shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the origin declarations submitted to them.\nArticle 29\nDiscrepancies and formal errors\n1.   The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not, ipso facto, render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.\n2.   Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin shall not cause this document to be rejected if those errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.\nArticle 30\nAmounts expressed in euro\n1.   For the application of the provisions of point (b) of Article 21(1) and Article 26(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Parties equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.\n2.   A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of point (b) of Article 21(1) or Article 26(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.\n3.   The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.\n4.   A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion were to result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n5.   The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Customs Sub-Committee at the request of any Party. When carrying out this review, the Customs Sub-Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.\nTITLE VI\nARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nArticle 31\nAdministrative cooperation\n1.   The customs authorities of the Parties shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1, and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and origin declarations.\n2.   In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Parties shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1, the origin declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.\nArticle 32\nVerification of proofs of origin\n1.   Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing Party shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the origin declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the request for verification. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.\n3.   The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.\n4.   If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.\n5.   The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results thereof as soon as possible. These results shall indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned may be considered as products originating in a Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n6.   If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.\nArticle 33\nDispute settlement\n1.   Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures provided for in Article 32 of this Protocol which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, those disputes shall be submitted to the Association Committee in Trade configuration as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement. Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement shall not apply.\n2.   Where disputes other than those related to the verification procedures provided for in Article 32 of this Protocol arise in relation to the interpretation of this Protocol, those disputes shall be submitted to the Customs Sub-Committee. A dispute settlement proceeding under Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement) of Title IV (Trade and Trade-related Matters) of this Agreement may only be initiated, if the Customs Sub-Committee has failed to resolve the dispute within six months from the date on which the dispute was submitted to the Customs Sub-Committee.\n3.   In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing Party shall take place under the legislation of that Party.\nArticle 34\nPenalties\nPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.\nArticle 35\nFree zones\n1.   The Parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin, which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article with regard to products originating in a Party are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone complies with this Protocol.\nTITLE VII\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\nArticle 36\nApplication of this Protocol\n1.   The term ‘European Union’ does not cover Ceuta and Melilla.\n2.   Products originating in Georgia, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the EU under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Communities. Georgia shall grant to imports of products covered by this Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the EU.\n3.   For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 of this Article with regard to products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 37.\nArticle 37\nSpecial conditions\n1.

Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.\n3.   The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter ‘Georgia’ and ‘Ceuta and Melilla’ in Box 2 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on origin declarations. In addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in Box 4 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on origin declarations.\n4.   The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.\nTITLE VIII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 38\nAmendments to this Protocol\n1.   The Customs Sub-Committee may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.\n2.   The Customs Sub-Committee shall, within one year following accession of Georgia to the Regional Convention on Pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin, replace the rules of origin set out in this Protocol by those appended to that Convention.\nArticle 39\nTransitional provisions for goods in transit or storage\nThe provisions of this Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Protocol and which on the date of entry into force of this Agreement are either in transit, in the Parties, in temporary storage in customs warehouses or in free zones, subject to the submission to the customs authorities of the importing Party, within four months of that date, of a proof of origin made out retrospectively together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly in accordance with Article 13.\n(1)  Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 on implementing the final phase of the Customs Union applies to products other than agricultural products as defined in the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Community and Turkey and other than coal and steel products as defined in the Agreement between the European Coal and Steel Community and the Republic of Turkey on trade in products covered by the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community.\nANNEX I TO PROTOCOL I\nINTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II TO PROTOCOL II\nNote 1:\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol.\nNote 2:\n2.1.\nThe first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ‘ex’, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n2.2.\nWhere several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.\n2.3.\nWhere there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.\n2.4.\nWhere, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.\nNote 3:\n3.1.\nThe provisions of Article 5 of this Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where those products are used or in another factory in a Party.\nExample:\nAn engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging’ of heading ex 7224.\nIf this forging has been forged in the EU from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the EU. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.\n3.2.\nThe rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\n3.3.\nWithout prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading’, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.\nHowever, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.\n3.4.\nWhen a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\nExample:\nThe rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.\n3.5.\nWhere a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule (see also Note 6.2 in relation to textiles).\nExample:\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.\nHowever, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\nExample:\nIn the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth – even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is, the fibre stage.\n3.6.\nWhere, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.\nNote 4:\n4.1.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.\n4.2.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.\n4.3.\nThe terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n4.4.\nThe term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.\nNote 5:\n5.1.\nWhere, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (see also Notes 5.3 and 5.4).\n5.2.\nHowever, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n—\nsilk,\n—\nwool,\n—\ncoarse animal hair,\n—\nfine animal hair,\n—\nhorsehair,\n—\ncotton,\n—\npaper-making materials and paper,\n—\nflax,\n—\ntrue hemp,\n—\njute and other textile bast fibres,\n—\nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,\n—\ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,\n—\nsynthetic man-made filaments,\n—\nartificial man-made filaments,\n—\ncurrent-conducting filaments,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),\n—\nother synthetic man-made staple fibres,\n—\nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n—\nother artificial man-made staple fibres,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,\n—\nproducts of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,\n—\nother products of heading 5605.\nExample:\nA yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the rules of origin (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.\nExample:\nA woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the rules of origin (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the rules of origin (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.\nExample:\nTufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\nExample:\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.\n5.3.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.\n5.4.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.\nNote 6:\n6.1.\nWhere, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.\n6.2.\nWithout prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.\nExample:\nIf a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\n6.3.\nWhere a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\nNote 7:\n7.1.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation, and\n(i)\nisomerisation.\n7.2.\nFor the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation;\n(j)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n(k)\nin respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n(l)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n(m)\nin respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;\n(n)\nin respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;\n(o)\nin respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.\n7.3.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.\nANNEX II TO PROTOCOL I\nLIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER FOR THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED TO OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS\nThe products mentioned in the list may not be all covered by this Agreement.
