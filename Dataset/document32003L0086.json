This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.(3) The European Council, at its special meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999, acknowledged the need for harmonisation of national legislation on the conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals. In this context, it has in particular stated that the European Union should ensure fair treatment of third country nationals residing lawfully on the territory of the Member States and that a more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of citizens of the European Union. The European Council accordingly asked the Council rapidly to adopt the legal instruments on the basis of Commission proposals. The need for achieving the objectives defined at Tampere have been reaffirmed by the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001.(4) Family reunification is a necessary way of making family life possible. It helps to create sociocultural stability facilitating the integration of third country nationals in the Member State, which also serves to promote economic and social cohesion, a fundamental Community objective stated in the Treaty.(5) Member States should give effect to the provisions of this Directive without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic characteristics, language, religion or beliefs, political or other opinions, membership of a national minority, fortune, birth, disabilities, age or sexual orientation.(6) To protect the family and establish or preserve family life, the material conditions for exercising the right to family reunification should be determined on the basis of common criteria.(7) Member States should be able to apply this Directive also when the family enters together.(8) Special attention should be paid to the situation of refugees on account of the reasons which obliged them to flee their country and prevent them from leading a normal family life there. More favourable conditions should therefore be laid down for the exercise of their right to family reunification.(9) Family reunification should apply in any case to members of the nuclear family, that is to say the spouse and the minor children.(10) It is for the Member States to decide whether they wish to authorise family reunification for relatives in the direct ascending line, adult unmarried children, unmarried or registered partners as well as, in the event of a polygamous marriage, minor children of a further spouse and the sponsor. Where a Member State authorises family reunification of these persons, this is without prejudice of the possibility, for Member States which do not recognise the existence of family ties in the cases covered by this provision, of not granting to the said persons the treatment of family members with regard to the right to reside in another Member State, as defined by the relevant EC legislation.(11) The right to family reunification should be exercised in proper compliance with the values and principles recognised by the Member States, in particular with respect to the rights of women and of children; such compliance justifies the possible taking of restrictive measures against applications for family reunification of polygamous households.(12) The possibility of limiting the right to family reunification of children over the age of 12, whose primary residence is not with the sponsor, is intended to reflect the children's capacity for integration at early ages and shall ensure that they acquire the necessary education and language skills in school.(13) A set of rules governing the procedure for examination of applications for family reunification and for entry and residence of family members should be laid down. Those procedures should be effective and manageable, taking account of the normal workload of the Member States' administrations, as well as transparent and fair, in order to offer appropriate legal certainty to those concerned.(14) Family reunification may be refused on duly justified grounds. In particular, the person who wishes to be granted family reunification should not constitute a threat to public policy or public security. The notion of public policy may cover a conviction for committing a serious crime. In this context it has to be noted that the notion of public policy and public security covers also cases in which a third country national belongs to an association which supports terrorism, supports such an association or has extremist aspirations.(15) The integration of family members should be promoted. For that purpose, they should be granted a status independent of that of the sponsor, in particular in cases of breakup of marriages and partnerships, and access to education, employment and vocational training on the same terms as the person with whom they are reunited, under the relevant conditions.(16) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the establishment of a right to family reunification for third country nationals to be exercised in accordance with common rules, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved by the Community, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.(17) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol these Member States are not participating in the adoption of this Directive and are not bound by or subject to its application.(18) In accordance with Article 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its application,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:CHAPTER I General provisionsArticle 1The purpose of this Directive is to determine the conditions for the exercise of the right to family reunification by third country nationals residing lawfully in the territory of the Member States.Article 2For the purposes of this Directive:(a) \"third country national\" means any person who is not a citizen of the Union within the meaning of Article 17(1) of the Treaty;(b) \"refugee\" means any third country national or stateless person enjoying refugee status within the meaning of the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the Protocol signed in New York on 31 January 1967;(c) \"sponsor\" means a third country national residing lawfully in a Member State and applying or whose family members apply for family reunification to be joined with him/her;(d) \"family reunification\" means the entry into and residence in a Member State by family members of a third country national residing lawfully in that Member State in order to preserve the family unit, whether the family relationship arose before or after the resident's entry;(e) \"residence permit\" means any authorisation issued by the authorities of a Member State allowing a third country national to stay legally in its territory, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 of 13 June 2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals(5);(f) \"unaccompanied minor\" means third country nationals or stateless persons below the age of eighteen, who arrive on the territory of the Member States unaccompanied by an adult responsible by law or custom, and for as long as they are not effectively taken into the care of such a person, or minors who are left unaccompanied after they entered the territory of the Member States.Article 31.

This Directive shall not affect the possibility for the Member States to adopt or maintain more favourable provisions.CHAPTER II Family membersArticle 41. The Member States shall authorise the entry and residence, pursuant to this Directive and subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Chapter IV, as well as in Article 16, of the following family members:(a) the sponsor's spouse;(b) the minor children of the sponsor and of his/her spouse, including children adopted in accordance with a decision taken by the competent authority in the Member State concerned or a decision which is automatically enforceable due to international obligations of that Member State or must be recognised in accordance with international obligations;(c) the minor children including adopted children of the sponsor where the sponsor has custody and the children are dependent on him or her.

In the event of a polygamous marriage, where the sponsor already has a spouse living with him in the territory of a Member State, the Member State concerned shall not authorise the family reunification of a further spouse.By way of derogation from paragraph 1(c), Member States may limit the family reunification of minor children of a further spouse and the sponsor.5. In order to ensure better integration and to prevent forced marriages Member States may require the sponsor and his/her spouse to be of a minimum age, and at maximum 21 years, before the spouse is able to join him/her.6. By way of derogation, Member States may request that the applications concerning family reunification of minor children have to be submitted before the age of 15, as provided for by its existing legislation on the date of the implementation of this Directive. If the application is submitted after the age of 15, the Member States which decide to apply this derogation shall authorise the entry and residence of such children on grounds other than family reunification.CHAPTER III Submission and examination of the applicationArticle 51. Member States shall determine whether, in order to exercise the right to family reunification, an application for entry and residence shall be submitted to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned either by the sponsor or by the family member or members.2. The application shall be accompanied by documentary evidence of the family relationship and of compliance with the conditions laid down in Articles 4 and 6 and, where applicable, Articles 7 and 8, as well as certified copies of family member(s)' travel documents.If appropriate, in order to obtain evidence that a family relationship exists, Member States may carry out interviews with the sponsor and his/her family members and conduct other investigations that are found to be necessary.When examining an application concerning the unmarried partner of the sponsor, Member States shall consider, as evidence of the family relationship, factors such as a common child, previous cohabitation, registration of the partnership and any other reliable means of proof.3. The application shall be submitted and examined when the family members are residing outside the territory of the Member State in which the sponsor resides.By way of derogation, a Member State may, in appropriate circumstances, accept an application submitted when the family members are already in its territory.4. The competent authorities of the Member State shall give the person, who has submitted the application, written notification of the decision as soon as possible and in any event no later than nine months from the date on which the application was lodged.In exceptional circumstances linked to the complexity of the examination of the application, the time limit referred to in the first subparagraph may be extended.Reasons shall be given for the decision rejecting the application. Any consequences of no decision being taken by the end of the period provided for in the first subparagraph shall be determined by the national legislation of the relevant Member State.5. When examining an application, the Member States shall have due regard to the best interests of minor children.CHAPTER IV Requirements for the exercise of the right to family reunificationArticle 61. The Member States may reject an application for entry and residence of family members on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.2.

Member States may require third country nationals to comply with integration measures, in accordance with national law.With regard to the refugees and/or family members of refugees referred to in Article 12 the integration measures referred to in the first subparagraph may only be applied once the persons concerned have been granted family reunification.Article 8Member States may require the sponsor to have stayed lawfully in their territory for a period not exceeding two years, before having his/her family members join him/her.By way of derogation, where the legislation of a Member State relating to family reunification in force on the date of adoption of this Directive takes into account its reception capacity, the Member State may provide for a waiting period of no more than three years between submission of the application for family reunification and the issue of a residence permit to the family members.CHAPTER V Family reunification of refugeesArticle 91. This Chapter shall apply to family reunification of refugees recognised by the Member States.2.

Article 5 shall apply to the submission and examination of the application, subject to paragraph 2 of this Article.2. Where a refugee cannot provide official documentary evidence of the family relationship, the Member States shall take into account other evidence, to be assessed in accordance with national law, of the existence of such relationship. A decision rejecting an application may not be based solely on the fact that documentary evidence is lacking.Article 121. By way of derogation from Article 7, the Member States shall not require the refugee and/or family member(s) to provide, in respect of applications concerning those family members referred to in Article 4(1), the evidence that the refugee fulfils the requirements set out in Article 7.Without prejudice to international obligations, where family reunification is possible in a third country with which the sponsor and/or family member has special links, Member States may require provision of the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph.Member States may require the refugee to meet the conditions referred to in Article 7(1) if the application for family reunification is not submitted within a period of three months after the granting of the refugee status.2.

These conditions shall set a time limit which shall in no case exceed 12 months, during which Member States may examine the situation of their labour market before authorising family members to exercise an employed or self-employed activity.3. Member States may restrict access to employment or self-employed activity by first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line or adult unmarried children to whom Article 4(2) applies.Article 151. Not later than after five years of residence, and provided that the family member has not been granted a residence permit for reasons other than family reunification, the spouse or unmarried partner and a child who has reached majority shall be entitled, upon application, if required, to an autonomous residence permit, independent of that of the sponsor.Member States may limit the granting of the residence permit referred to in the first subparagraph to the spouse or unmarried partner in cases of breakdown of the family relationship.2. The Member States may issue an autonomous residence permit to adult children and to relatives in the direct ascending line to whom Article 4(2) applies.3. In the event of widowhood, divorce, separation, or death of first-degree relatives in the direct ascending or descending line, an autonomous residence permit may be issued, upon application, if required, to persons who have entered by virtue of family reunification. Member States shall lay down provisions ensuring the granting of an autonomous residence permit in the event of particularly difficult circumstances.4. The conditions relating to the granting and duration of the autonomous residence permit are established by national law.CHAPTER VII Penalties and redressArticle 161.

Member States may also reject an application for entry and residence for the purpose of family reunification, or withdraw or refuse to renew the family member's residence permits, where it is shown that:(a) false or misleading information, false or falsified documents were used, fraud was otherwise committed or other unlawful means were used;(b) the marriage, partnership or adoption was contracted for the sole purpose of enabling the person concerned to enter or reside in a Member State.When making an assessment with respect to this point, Member States may have regard in particular to the fact that the marriage, partnership or adoption was contracted after the sponsor had been issued his/her residence permit.3. The Member States may withdraw or refuse to renew the residence permit of a family member where the sponsor's residence comes to an end and the family member does not yet enjoy an autonomous right of residence under Article 15.4. Member States may conduct specific checks and inspections where there is reason to suspect that there is fraud or a marriage, partnership or adoption of convenience as defined by paragraph 2. Specific checks may also be undertaken on the occasion of the renewal of family members' residence permit.Article 17Member States shall take due account of the nature and solidity of the person's family relationships and the duration of his residence in the Member State and of the existence of family, cultural and social ties with his/her country of origin where they reject an application, withdraw or refuse to renew a residence permit or decide to order the removal of the sponsor or members of his family.Article 18The Member States shall ensure that the sponsor and/or the members of his/her family have the right to mount a legal challenge where an application for family reunification is rejected or a residence permit is either not renewed or is withdrawn or removal is ordered.The procedure and the competence according to which the right referred to in the first subparagraph is exercised shall be established by the Member States concerned.CHAPTER VIII Final provisionsArticle 19Periodically, and for the first time not later than 3 October 2007, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Directive in the Member States and shall propose such amendments as may appear necessary. These proposals for amendments shall be made by way of priority in relation to Articles 3, 4, 7, 8 and 13.Article 20Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by not later than 3 October 2005. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by the Member States.Article 21This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.Article 22This Directive is addressed to the Member States in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community.Done at Brussels, 22 September 2003.For the CouncilThe PresidentF.

The intention is to enable family members of non-EU nationals residing lawfully on the territory of the EU to join them in the EU country in which they are residing. The objective is to protect the family unit and to facilitate the integration of nationals of non-member countries.It does not apply to Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom (1). In addition, it does not preclude any more favourable conditions recognised by national legislation.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nConditionsNon-EU nationals who hold a residence permit valid for at least one year in one of the EU countries and who have the legal option of long-term residence can apply for family reunification.However, this directive does not apply to family members of an EU citizen, or to non-EU nationals applying for recognition of refugee status whose application has not yet given rise to a final decision or who are under a temporary form of protection.The following are eligible for family reunification:\nthe sponsor’s spouse;\nthe minor children of the couple (i.e. unmarried children below the legal age of majority in the EU country concerned), or of one member of the couple, where he/she has custody and the children are dependent on him/her, including adopted children.\nEU countries remain free to authorise, under certain conditions, family reunification of:\nfirst-degree ascendants in the direct line (father and mother of the foreign national);\nunmarried children above the age of majority;\nunmarried partners.\nPolygamy is not recognised; only one spouse can benefit from the right to reunification. Likewise, children of the ineligible spouses are excluded from the right to reunification unless their best interests warrant it (in accordance with the 1989 Convention on Children’s Rights).EU countries are also permitted to require the non-EU national and his/her spouse to be of a minimum age (subject to a maximum of 21 years), before they can exercise the right to family reunification.\nProcedure\nEU countries determine whether it is the foreign national, or the family members who wish to join him/her, who is to submit the application for family reunification. Except in special cases, the family member to be reunited must remain outside the EU during the procedure. The application must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the family relationship and of compliance with the conditions laid down. The application must be examined within 9 months after submission.\nThe person concerned may be required to have accommodation that meets general safety and health standards, sickness insurance and stable resources sufficient to maintain himself/herself and the members of his/her family. Furthermore, he/she may be required to abide by integration measures under national law, as well as to have resided in the EU country in question for a certain period of time (2 years maximum) before being joined by the family members.\nA family member may be refused entry or residence on grounds of public policy, internal security or public health. This also applies in the case of fraud (falsification of documents, marriage of convenience, etc.). The same grounds may justify the withdrawal or non-renewal of a permit that has already been granted.\nPersons whose permit is refused, withdrawn or not renewed must have the right to mount a legal challenge.\nWith regard to the family reunification of refugees, EU countries may not impose conditions regarding a minimum stay in the territory before being joined by their family members. Furthermore, they are exempt from fulfilling the above conditions relating to accommodation, health insurance and resources if the application for family reunification is submitted within 3 months of refugee status being given.\nRights of family members\nFamily members of the foreign national are entitled to a residence permit of the same duration as that of the person they have joined and, on the same terms as that person, to access to education, employment and vocational training.\nAfter 5 years of residence (not later), the spouse or unmarried partner and any children who have reached majority are entitled to an autonomous residence permit.\nThe conditions relating to the granting and duration of the autonomous residence permit are established by national law. EU countries may only limit the granting of the autonomous residence permit for spouses or unmarried couples in cases of breakdown of the family relationship.\nGuidance on the application of the directive\nIn 2014, the European Commission published guidance for EU countries on the application of the directive.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 3 October 2003 and had to become law in the EU countries by 3 October 2005.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFamily reunification (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification (OJ L 251, 3.10.2003, pp. 12-18)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on guidance for application of Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification (COM(2014) 210 final, 3.4.2014)\nGreen Paper on the right to family reunification of third-country nationals living in the European Union (Directive 2003/86/EC) (COM(2011) 735 final, 15.11.2011)\nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification (COM(2008) 610 final, 8.10.2008) \nlast update 05.06.2018(1) The United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union and becomes a third country (non-EU country) as of 1 February 2020.", "tags": ["family migration", "foreign national", "EU Member State", "rights of aliens", "EU migration policy"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
