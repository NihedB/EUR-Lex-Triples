{"celex_id": "32008L0007", "reference": "21.2.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 46/11\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2008/7/EC\nof 12 February 2008\nconcerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 93 and 94 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 69/335/EEC of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nThe indirect taxes on the raising of capital, namely the capital duty (the duty chargeable on contributions of capital to companies and firms), the stamp duty on securities, and duty on restructuring operations, regardless of whether those operations involve an increase in capital, give rise to discrimination, double taxation and disparities which interfere with the free movement of capital. The same applies as regards other indirect taxes with the same characteristics as capital duty and the stamp duty on securities.\n(3)\nConsequently, it is in the interests of the internal market to harmonise the legislation on indirect taxes on the raising of capital in order to eliminate, as far as possible, factors which may distort conditions of competition or hinder the free movement of capital.\n(4)\nThe economic effects of capital duty are detrimental to the regrouping and development of undertakings. Such effects are particularly harmful in the present economic situation in which there is a paramount need for priority to be given to stimulating investment.\n(5)\nThe best solution for attaining these objectives would be to abolish capital duty.\n(6)\nHowever, the losses of revenue which would result from the immediate application of such a measure are unacceptable for Member States which currently apply capital duty. Those Member States should therefore have the opportunity to continue to subject to capital duty all or part of the transactions concerned, it being understood that a single rate of tax must be charged within one and the same Member State. Once a Member State has chosen not to levy capital duty on all or part of the transactions under this Directive, it should not be possible for it to reintroduce such duties.\n(7)\nIt is inherent in the concept of an internal market that a duty on the raising of capital within the internal market by a company or firm should not be charged more than once. Accordingly, if the Member State to which the taxing right is attributed does not levy capital duty on certain or all transactions covered by this Directive, no other Member State is to exercise a taxing right in respect of those transactions.\n(8)\nIt is appropriate to maintain strict conditions for situations where Member States continue to levy capital duty, in particular as regards exemptions and reductions.\n(9)\nApart from capital duty, no indirect taxes on the raising of capital should be levied. In particular, no stamp duty should be levied on securities, regardless of the origin of such securities, and regardless of whether they represent a company’s own capital or its loan capital.\n(10)\nThe list of capital companies set out in Directive 69/335/EEC is incomplete and should therefore be adapted.\n(11)\nSince the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(12)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the earlier Directives. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directives.\n(13)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\n(14)\nIn view of the detrimental effects of capital duty, the Commission should report every three years on the operation of this Directive with a view to abolishing this duty,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive regulates the levying of indirect taxes in respect of the following:\n(a)\ncontributions of capital to capital companies;\n(b)\nrestructuring operations involving capital companies;\n(c)\nthe issue of certain securities and debentures.\nArticle 2\nCapital company\n1.

For the purposes of this Directive, any other company, firm, association or legal person operating for profit shall be deemed to be a capital company.\nArticle 3\nContributions of capital\nFor the purposes of this Directive and subject to Article 4, the following transactions shall be considered to be ‘contributions of capital’:\n(a)\nthe formation of a capital company;\n(b)\nthe conversion into a capital company of a company, firm, association or legal person which is not a capital company;\n(c)\nan increase in the capital of a capital company by contribution of assets of any kind;\n(d)\nan increase in the assets of a capital company by contribution of assets of any kind, in consideration not of shares in the capital or assets of the company, but of rights of the same kind as those of members, such as voting rights, a share in the profits or a share in the surplus upon liquidation;\n(e)\nthe transfer from a third country to a Member State of the centre of effective management of a capital company whose registered office is in a third country;\n(f)\nthe transfer from a third country to a Member State of the registered office of a capital company whose centre of effective management is in a third country;\n(g)\nan increase in the capital of a capital company by capitalisation of profits or of permanent or temporary reserves;\n(h)\nan increase in the assets of a capital company through the provision of services by a member which does not entail an increase in the company’s capital, but which does result in a variation in the rights in the company or which may increase the value of the company’s shares;\n(i)\na loan taken up by a capital company, if the creditor is entitled to a share in the profits of the company;\n(j)\na loan taken up by a capital company with a member or a member’s spouse or child, or a loan taken up with a third party, if it is guaranteed by a member, on condition that such loans have the same function as an increase in the company’s capital.\nArticle 4\nRestructuring operations\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive, the following restructuring operations shall not be considered to be contributions of capital:\n(a)\nthe transfer by one or more capital companies of all their assets and liabilities, or one or more branches of activity to one or more capital companies which are in the process of being formed or which are already in existence, provided that the consideration for the transfer consists at least in part of securities representing the capital of the acquiring company;\n(b)\nthe acquisition, by a capital company which is in the process of being formed or which is already in existence, of shares representing a majority of the voting rights of another capital company, provided that the consideration for the shares acquired consists at least in part of securities representing the capital of the former company. Where the majority of the voting rights is reached by means of two or more transactions, only the transaction whereby the majority of voting rights is reached and any subsequent transactions shall be regarded as restructuring operations.\n2.   Restructuring operations shall also include the transfer to a capital company of all assets and liabilities of another capital company which is wholly owned by the former company.\nCHAPTER II\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 5\nTransactions not subject to indirect tax\n1.

Capital duty shall be charged at a single rate.\n2.   The rate of capital duty applied by a Member State may not exceed the rate applied by that Member State on 1 January 2006.\nWhere, after that date, the Member State reduces the rate applied, it may not reintroduce a higher rate.\n3.   The rate of capital duty may not in any event exceed 1 %.\nArticle 9\nExclusion of certain entities from the scope of application\nMember States may for the purposes of levying capital duty choose not to regard as capital companies the entities referred to in Article 2(2).\nArticle 10\nTransactions subject to capital duty and distribution of taxing rights\n1.   Where, pursuant to Article 7(1), a Member State continues to charge capital duty, it shall subject to capital duty the contributions of capital referred to in Article 3(a) to (d), if the centre of effective management of the capital company is situated in that Member State at the time when the contribution of capital is made.\nIt shall also subject to capital duty the contributions of capital referred to in Article 3(e) and (f).\n2.   Where a Member State continues to charge capital duty, it may do so on the contributions of capital referred to in Article 3(g) to (j), if the centre of effective management of the capital company is situated in that Member State at the time when the contribution of capital is made.\n3.   Where the centre of effective management of a capital company is situated in a third country and its registered office is situated in a Member State which continues to charge capital duty, contributions of capital shall be subject to capital duty in that Member State.\n4.

In the case of an increase in capital, the basis of assessment for capital duty shall not include the following:\n(a)\nthe amount of the assets belonging to the capital company which are allocated to the increase in capital and which have already been subjected to capital duty;\n(b)\nthe amount of the loans taken up by the capital company which are converted into shares in the company and which have already been subjected to capital duty.\n2.   A Member State may exclude from the basis of assessment for capital duty the amount of the capital contributed by a member with unlimited liability for the obligations of a capital company as well as the share of such a member in the company’s assets.\nWhere a Member State exercises that power, any transaction as a result of which the liability of a member is limited to his share in the company’s capital, in particular when the limitation of liability results from the conversion of a capital company into a different type of capital company, shall be subject to capital duty.\nCapital duty shall be charged in all such cases on the value of the share in the company’s assets belonging to members with unlimited liability for the company’s obligations.\n3.   In the case of a contribution of capital as referred to in Article 3(c), following a reduction in the company’s capital as a result of losses sustained, that part of the contribution of capital which corresponds to the reduction in capital may be excluded from the basis of assessment, provided that the contribution of capital occurs within four years of the reduction in capital.\nArticle 13\nExemption of contributions of capital to certain capital companies\nMember States may exempt from capital duty contributions of capital made to the following:\n(a)\ncapital companies which supply public services, such as public transport undertakings, port authorities or undertakings supplying water, gas or electricity, in cases where the State or regional or local authorities own at least half of the company’s capital;\n(b)\ncapital companies which, in accordance with their regulations and in fact, pursue exclusively and directly cultural, social, relief or educational objectives.\nMember States which exempt such contributions of capital from capital duty shall also apply the exemption to the supply of fixed or working capital to a branch within its territory as referred to in Article 10(4).\nArticle 14\nDerogation procedure\nCertain types of contributions of capital or of capital companies may be the subject of exemptions or reductions in rates in order to achieve fairness in taxation, or for social considerations, or to enable a Member State to deal with special situations.\nThe Member State which proposes to take such a measure shall refer the matter to the Commission in good time, having regard to the application of Article 97 of the Treaty.\nCHAPTER IV\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 15\nTransposition\n1.

Indirect taxes are those levied on goods and services rather than on income or profits.\nWhile it generally prohibits these taxes, notably capital duty*, it allows certain countries to levy them if they meet certain exceptional conditions.\nKEY POINTS\nTax and the companies concerned\nThe directive seeks to regulate the levying of indirect taxes on:\ncontributions of capital to capital companies;\nrestructuring operations involving capital companies;\nthe issue of certain securities and debentures (long-term securities yielding a fixed rate of interest).\nThe directive applies to the following companies:\nlimited companies (private companies whose owners are legally responsible for their debts only to the extent of the amount of capital they invested);\nlimited partnerships with share capital (part of the capital that comes from the issue of shares);\nlimited liability companies.\nIn this directive ‘capital company’ means any company, firm, association or legal person:\nwhose shares can be dealt on the stock exchange;\nwhose members may freely dispose of their shares and are only responsible for company debts to the extent of their shares;\nand, as a rule, any other which operates for profit.\nThe directive clarifies what is meant by contributions of capital (including the formation of or conversion into a capital company or the increases in capital shareholding either by contributions of assets or by capitalisation of profits or reserves). It also defines restructuring operations such as mergers affected by the contribution of assets or by the exchange of shares.\nProhibition on levying indirect tax on the raising of capital\nEU countries may not levy indirect tax on the raising of capital to capital companies.\nThese transactions affect the following in particular:\ncontributions of capital;\nloans or services provided as part of contributions of capital;\nregistration or other formalities required before starting a business because of the company’s legal form;\nalteration of the instruments constituting the company*;\nrestructuring operations.\nThe directive also prohibits indirect taxes on the issue of certain securities and debentures. However, EU countries may charge certain transfer duties, fees, dues or value added tax.\nExemptions\nSpecial rules apply to EU countries that charged a duty on contributions of capital to capital companies (capital duty) as at 1 January 2006. Those countries may continue to levy the duty, which must be charged at a single rate not exceeding 1% and may be charged solely on contributions of capital, i.e. capital duty may not be charged on other transactions such as restructuring operations.\nCapital duty may only be levied by an EU country if the centre of effective management of the capital company is situated in that country at the time the contribution is made. In addition, capital duty can only be charged once in the EU.\nExemptions from capital duty may be applied to capital companies which supply a public service or have an exclusively cultural or social aim.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 12 March 2008. It had to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 2008.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCapital duty: an indirect tax payable when capital companies are formed and which interferes with the free movement of capital.\nInstruments constituting the company: the company’s constitution or the legal act setting up the company.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (OJ L 46, 21.2.2008, pp. 11-22)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2008/7/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
