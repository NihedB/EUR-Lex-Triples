{"celex_id": "32011L0061", "reference": "1.7.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 174/1\nDIRECTIVE 2011/61/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 8 June 2011\non Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 1095/2010\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 53(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nManagers of alternative investment funds (AIFMs) are responsible for the management of a significant amount of invested assets in the Union, account for significant amounts of trading in markets for financial instruments, and can exercise an important influence on markets and companies in which they invest.\n(2)\nThe impact of AIFMs on the markets in which they operate is largely beneficial, but recent financial difficulties have underlined how the activities of AIFMs may also serve to spread or amplify risks through the financial system. Uncoordinated national responses make the efficient management of those risks difficult. This Directive therefore aims at establishing common requirements governing the authorisation and supervision of AIFMs in order to provide a coherent approach to the related risks and their impact on investors and markets in the Union.\n(3)\nRecent difficulties in financial markets have underlined that many AIFM strategies are vulnerable to some or several important risks in relation to investors, other market participants and markets. In order to provide comprehensive and common arrangements for supervision, it is necessary to establish a framework capable of addressing those risks taking into account the diverse range of investment strategies and techniques employed by AIFMs. Consequently, this Directive should apply to AIFMs managing all types of funds that are not covered by Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (4), irrespective of the legal or contractual manner in which the AIFMs are entrusted with this responsibility. AIFMs should not be entitled to manage UCITS within the meaning of Directive 2009/65/EC on the basis of an authorisation under this Directive.\n(4)\nThis Directive aims to provide for an internal market for AIFMs and a harmonised and stringent regulatory and supervisory framework for the activities within the Union of all AIFMs, including those which have their registered office in a Member State (EU AIFMs) and those which have their registered office in a third country (non-EU AIFMs). As the practical consequences and possible difficulties resulting from a harmonised regulatory framework and an internal market for non-EU AIFMs performing management and/or marketing activities within the Union and EU AIFMs managing non-EU alternative investment funds (AIFs), are uncertain and difficult to predict due to the lack of previous experience in this regard, a review mechanism should be provided for. It is intended that, after a transitional period of 2 years, a harmonised passport regime become applicable to non-EU AIFMs performing management and/or marketing activities within the Union and EU AIFMs managing non-EU AIFs after the entry into force of a delegated act by the Commission in this regard. It is intended that the harmonised regime, during a further transitional period of 3 years, co-exist with the national regimes of the Member States subject to certain minimum harmonised conditions. After that 3-year period of co-existence, it is intended that the national regimes be brought to an end on the entry into force of a further delegated act by the Commission.\n(5)\n4 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, the Commission should review the application and the scope of this Directive taking into account its objectives and should assess whether or not the Union harmonised approach has caused any ongoing major market disruption and whether or not this Directive functions effectively in light of the principles of the internal market and of a level playing field.\n(6)\nThe scope of this Directive should be limited to entities managing AIFs as a regular business – regardless of whether the AIF is of an open-ended or a closed-ended type, whatever the legal form of the AIF, and whether or not the AIF is listed – which raise capital from a number of investors with a view to investing that capital for the benefit of those investors in accordance with a defined investment policy.\n(7)\nInvestment undertakings, such as family office vehicles which invest the private wealth of investors without raising external capital, should not be considered to be AIFs in accordance with this Directive.\n(8)\nThe entities not considered to be AIFMs pursuant to this Directive fall outside its scope. As a consequence, this Directive should not apply to holding companies as defined herein. However, managers of private equity funds or AIFMs managing AIFs whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market should not be excluded from its scope. Further, this Directive should not apply to the management of pension funds; employee participation or savings schemes; supranational institutions; national central banks; national, regional and local governments and bodies or institutions which manage funds supporting social security and pension systems; securitisation special purpose entities; or insurance contracts and joint ventures.\n(9)\nInvestment firms authorised under Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (5) and credit institutions authorised under Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (6) should not be required to obtain an authorisation under this Directive in order to provide investment services such as individual portfolio management in respect of AIFs. However, investment firms should be able, directly or indirectly, to offer units or shares of an AIF to, or place such units or shares with, investors in the Union only to the extent that the units or shares can be marketed in accordance with this Directive. When transposing this Directive into national law, the Member States should take into account the regulatory purpose of that requirement and should ensure that investment firms established in a third country that, pursuant to the relevant national law, can provide investment services in respect of AIFs also fall within the scope of that requirement. The provision of investment services by those entities in respect of AIFs should never amount to a de facto circumvention of this Directive by means of turning the AIFM into a letter-box entity, irrespective of whether the AIFM is established in the Union or in a third country.\n(10)\nThis Directive does not regulate AIFs. AIFs should therefore be able to continue to be regulated and supervised at national level. It would be disproportionate to regulate the structure or composition of the portfolios of AIFs managed by AIFMs at Union level and it would be difficult to provide for such extensive harmonisation due to the very diverse types of AIFs managed by AIFMs. This Directive therefore does not prevent Member States from adopting or from continuing to apply national requirements in respect of AIFs established in their territory. The fact that a Member State may impose requirements additional to those applicable in other Member States on AIFs established in its territory should not prevent the exercise of rights of AIFMs authorised in accordance with this Directive in other Member States to market to professional investors in the Union certain AIFs established outside the Member State imposing additional requirements and which are therefore not subject to and do not need to comply with those additional requirements.\n(11)\nSeveral provisions of this Directive require AIFMs to ensure compliance with requirements for which, in some fund structures, AIFMs are not responsible. An example of such fund structures is where the responsibility for appointing the depositary rests with the AIF or another entity acting on behalf of the AIF. In such cases, the AIFM has no ultimate control over whether a depositary is in fact appointed unless the AIF is internally managed. Since this Directive does not regulate AIFs, it cannot require an AIF to appoint a depositary. In cases of failure of an AIFM to ensure compliance with the applicable requirements of an AIF or another entity on its behalf, the competent authorities should require the AIFM to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation. If, despite such steps, the non-compliance persists, and in so far as it concerns an EU AIFM or an authorised non-EU AIFM managing an EU AIF, the AIFM should resign as manager of that AIF. If the AIFM fails to resign, the competent authorities of its home Member State should require such resignation and the marketing in the Union of the AIF concerned should no longer be permitted. The same prohibition should apply to authorised non-EU AIFMs marketing non-EU AIFs in the Union.\n(12)\nUnless specifically provided for otherwise, where this Directive refers to the interests of the investors of an AIF the investors’ interests in their specific capacity as investors of the AIF, and not their individual interests, are envisaged.\n(13)\nSubject to the exceptions and restrictions provided for, this Directive should be applicable to all EU AIFMs managing EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs, irrespective of whether or not they are marketed in the Union, to non-EU AIFMs managing EU AIFs, irrespective of whether or not they are marketed in the Union, and to non-EU AIFMs marketing EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs in the Union.\n(14)\nThis Directive lays down requirements regarding the manner in which AIFMs should manage AIFs under their responsibility. For non-EU AIFMs this is limited to the management of EU AIFs and other AIFs the units or shares of which are also marketed to professional investors in the Union.\n(15)\nThe authorisation of EU AIFMs in accordance with this Directive covers the management of EU AIFs established in the home Member State of the AIFM. Subject to further notification requirements, this also includes the marketing to professional investors within the Union of EU AIFs managed by the EU AIFM and the management of EU AIFs established in Member States other than the home Member State of the AIFM. This Directive also provides for the conditions subject to which authorised EU AIFMs are entitled to market non-EU AIFs to professional investors in the Union and the conditions subject to which a non-EU AIFM can obtain an authorisation to manage EU AIFs and/or to market AIFs to professional investors in the Union with a passport. During a period that is intended to be transitional, Member States should also be able to allow EU AIFMs to market non-EU AIFs in their territory only and/or to allow non-EU AIFMs to manage EU AIFs, and/or market AIFs to professional investors, in their territory only, subject to national law, in so far as certain minimum conditions pursuant to this Directive are met.\n(16)\nThis Directive should not apply to AIFMs in so far as they manage AIFs whose only investors are the AIFMs themselves or their parent undertakings, their subsidiaries or other subsidiaries of their parent undertaking and where those investors are not themselves AIFs.\n(17)\nThis Directive further provides for a lighter regime for AIFMs where the cumulative AIFs under management fall below a threshold of EUR 100 million and for AIFMs that manage only unleveraged AIFs that do not grant investors redemption rights during a period of 5 years where the cumulative AIFs under management fall below a threshold of EUR 500 million. Although the activities of the AIFMs concerned are unlikely to have individually significant consequences for financial stability, it is possible that aggregation causes their activities to give rise to systemic risks. Consequently, those AIFMs should not be subject to full authorisation but to registration in their home Member States and should, inter alia, provide their competent authorities with relevant information regarding the main instruments in which they are trading and on the principal exposures and most important concentrations of the AIFs they manage. However, in order to be able to benefit from the rights granted under this Directive, those smaller AIFMs should be allowed to be treated as AIFMs subject to the opt-in procedure provided for by this Directive. That exemption should not limit the ability of Member States to impose stricter requirements on those AIFMs that have not opted in.\n(18)\nNo EU AIFM should be able to manage and/or market EU AIFs to professional investors in the Union unless it has been authorised in accordance with this Directive. An AIFM authorised in accordance with this Directive should meet the conditions for authorisation established in this Directive at all times.\n(19)\nAs soon as this is permitted under this Directive, a non-EU AIFM intending to manage EU AIFs and/or market AIFs in the Union with a passport or an EU AIFM intending to market non-EU AIFs in the Union with a passport should also be authorised in accordance with this Directive. At least during a transitional period, a Member State should also be able to allow a non-EU AIFM to market AIFs in that Member State and to authorise an EU AIFM to market non-EU AIFs in that Member State in so far as the minimum conditions set out in this Directive are met.\n(20)\nDepending on their legal form, it should be possible for AIFs to be either externally or internally managed. AIFs should be deemed internally managed when the management functions are performed by the governing body or any other internal resource of the AIF. Where the legal form of the AIF permits internal management and where the AIF’s governing body chooses not to appoint an external AIFM, the AIF is also AIFM and should therefore comply with all requirements for AIFMs under this Directive and be authorised as such. An AIFM which is an internally managed AIF should however not be authorised as the external manager of other AIFs. An AIF should be deemed externally managed when an external legal person has been appointed as manager by or on behalf of the AIF, which through such appointment is responsible for managing the AIF. Where an external AIFM has been appointed to manage a particular AIF, that AIFM should not be deemed to be providing the investment service of portfolio management as defined in point (9) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC, but, rather, collective portfolio management in accordance with this Directive.\n(21)\nManagement of AIFs should mean providing at least investment management services. The single AIFM to be appointed pursuant to this Directive should never be authorised to provide portfolio management without also providing risk management or vice versa. Subject to the conditions set out in this Directive, an authorised AIFM should not, however, be prevented from also engaging in the activities of administration and marketing of an AIF or from engaging in activities related to the assets of the AIF. An external AIFM should not be prevented from also providing the service of management of portfolios of investments with mandates given by investors on a discretionary, client-by-client basis, including portfolios owned by pension funds and institutions for occupational retirement provision which are covered by Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (7), or from providing the non-core services of investment advice, safe-keeping and administration in relation to units of collective investment undertakings and reception and transmission of orders. Pursuant to authorisation under Directive 2009/65/EC, an external AIFM should be allowed to manage UCITS.\n(22)\nIt is necessary to ensure that AIFMs operate subject to robust governance controls. AIFMs should be managed and organised so as to minimise conflicts of interest. The organisational requirements established under this Directive should be without prejudice to systems and controls established by national law for the registration of persons working within or for an AIFM.\n(23)\nIt is necessary to provide for the application of minimum capital requirements to ensure the continuity and the regularity of the management of AIFs provided by an AIFM and to cover the potential exposure of AIFMs to professional liability in respect of all their activities, including the management of AIFs under a delegated mandate. AIFMs should be free to choose whether to cover potential risks of professional liability by additional own funds or by an appropriate professional indemnity insurance.\n(24)\nIn order to address the potentially detrimental effect of poorly designed remuneration structures on the sound management of risk and control of risk-taking behaviour by individuals, there should be an express obligation for AIFMs to establish and maintain, for those categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profiles of AIFs they manage, remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with sound and effective risk management. Those categories of staff should at least include senior management, risk takers, control functions, and any employees receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers.\n(25)\nThe principles governing remuneration policies should recognise that AIFMs are able to apply those policies in different ways according to their size and the size of the AIFs they manage, their internal organisation and the nature, the scope and the complexity of their activities.\n(26)\nThe principles regarding sound remuneration policies set out in the Commission Recommendation 2009/384/EC of 30 April 2009 on remuneration policies in the financial services sector (8) are consistent with and complement the principles of this Directive.\n(27)\nIn order to promote supervisory convergences in the assessment of remuneration policies and practices, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) (ESMA) should ensure the existence of guidelines on sound remuneration policies in the AIFM sector. The European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) should assist it in the elaboration of such guidelines.\n(28)\nThe provisions on remuneration should be without prejudice to the full exercise of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Treaties, in particular Article 153(5) TFEU, general principles of national contract and labour law, applicable legislation regarding shareholders’ rights and involvement and the general responsibilities of the administrative and supervisory bodies of the institution concerned, as well as the right, where applicable, of social partners to conclude and enforce collective agreements, in accordance with national laws and traditions.\n(29)\nReliable and objective asset valuation is crucial for the protection of investor interests. AIFMs employ different methodologies and systems for valuing assets, depending on the assets and markets in which they predominantly invest. It is appropriate to recognise those differences but, nevertheless, to require in all cases AIFMs to implement valuation procedures resulting in the proper valuation of assets of AIFs. The process for valuation of assets and calculation of the net asset value should be functionally independent from the portfolio management and the remuneration policy of the AIFM and other measures should ensure that conflicts of interest are prevented and that undue influence on the employees is prevented. Subject to certain conditions, AIFMs should be able to appoint an external valuer to perform the valuation function.\n(30)\nSubject to strict limitations and requirements, including the existence of objective reasons, an AIFM should be able to delegate the carrying out of some of its functions on its behalf in accordance with this Directive so as to increase the efficiency of the conduct of its business. Subject to the same conditions, sub-delegation should also be allowed. AIFMs should, however, remain responsible for the proper performance of the delegated functions and compliance with this Directive at all times.\n(31)\nThe strict limitations and requirements set out on the delegation of tasks by AIFMs should apply to the delegation of management functions set out in Annex I. Delegation of supporting tasks, such as administrative or technical functions performed by the AIFM as a part of its management tasks, should not be subject to the specific limitations and requirements set out in this Directive.\n(32)\nRecent developments underline the crucial need to separate asset safe-keeping and management functions, and to segregate investor assets from those of the manager. Although AIFMs manage AIFs with different business models and arrangements for, inter alia, asset safe-keeping, it is essential that a depositary separate from the AIFM is appointed to exercise depositary functions with respect to AIFs.\n(33)\nThe provisions of this Directive relating to the appointment and the tasks of a depositary should apply to all AIFs managed by an AIFM subject to this Directive and therefore to all AIF business models. They should, however, be adapted to the specificities of different business models. For some business models certain depositary tasks are more relevant than for others, depending on the type of assets the AIFs are investing in and the tasks related to those assets.\n(34)\nFor AIFs that have no redemption rights exercisable during the period of 5 years from the date of the initial investments and that, in accordance with their core investment policy, generally do not invest in assets that must be held in custody in accordance with this Directive or generally invest in issuers or non-listed companies in order potentially to acquire control over such companies in accordance with this Directive, such as private equity, venture capital funds and real estate funds, Member States should be able to allow a notary, a lawyer, a registrar or another entity to be appointed to carry out depositary functions. In such cases the depositary functions should be part of professional or business activities in respect of which the appointed entity is subject to mandatory professional registration recognised by law or to legal or regulatory provisions or rules of professional conduct and can provide sufficient financial and professional guarantees to enable it to perform effectively the relevant depositary functions and meet the commitments inherent in those functions. This takes account of current practice for certain types of closed-ended funds. However, for all other AIFs, the depositary should be a credit institution, an investment firm or another entity permitted under Directive 2009/65/EC, given the importance of the custody function. For non-EU AIFs only, it should also be possible for the depositary to be a credit institution or any other entity of the same nature as the entities referred to in this recital as long as it is subject to effective prudential regulation and supervision which have the same effect as Union law and are effectively enforced.\n(35)\nThe depositary should have its registered office or a branch in the same country as the AIF. It should be possible for a non-EU AIF to have a depositary established in the relevant third country only if certain additional conditions are met. On the basis of the criteria set out in delegated acts, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing measures, stating that prudential regulation and supervision of a third country have the same effect as Union law and are effectively enforced. Further, the mediation procedure set out in Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 should apply in the event that competent authorities disagree on the correct application of the other additional conditions. Alternatively, for non-EU AIFs, the depositary should also be able to be established in the home Member State or in the Member State of reference of the AIFM managing the AIF.\n(36)\nThe Commission is invited to examine the possibilities of putting forward an appropriate horizontal legislative proposal that clarifies the responsibilities and liabilities of a depositary and governs the right of a depositary in one Member State to provide its services in another Member State.\n(37)\nThe depositary should be responsible for the proper monitoring of the AIF’s cash flows, and, in particular, for ensuring that investor money and cash belonging to the AIF, or to the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF, is booked correctly on accounts opened in the name of the AIF or in the name of the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF or in the name of the depositary acting on behalf of the AIF for the safe-keeping of the assets of the AIF, including the holding in custody of financial instruments that can be registered in a financial instruments account opened in the depositary’s books and all financial instruments that can be physically delivered to the depositary, and for the verification of ownership of all other assets by the AIF or the AIFM on behalf of the AIF. When ensuring investor money is booked in cash accounts, the depositary should take into account the principles set out in Article 16 of Commission Directive 2006/73/EC of 10 August 2006 implementing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive (11).\n(38)\nA depositary should act honestly, fairly, professionally, independently and in the interest of the AIF or of the investors of the AIF.\n(39)\nIt should be possible for a depositary to delegate the safe-keeping of assets to a third party which, in its turn, should be able to delegate that function. However, delegation and sub-delegation should be objectively justified and subject to strict requirements in relation to the suitability of the third party entrusted with the delegated function, and in relation to the due skill, care and diligence that the depositary should employ to select, appoint and review that third party.\n(40)\nA third party to whom the safe-keeping of assets is delegated should be able to maintain a common segregated account for multiple AIFs, a so-called ‘omnibus account’.\n(41)\nEntrusting the custody of assets to the operator of a securities settlement system as designated for the purposes of Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 1998 on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems (12) or entrusting the provision of similar services to third-country securities settlement systems should not be considered to be a delegation of custody functions.\n(42)\nThe strict limitations and requirements to which the delegation of tasks by the depositary is subject should apply to the delegation of its specific functions as a depositary, namely the monitoring of the cash flow, the safe-keeping of assets and the oversight functions. Delegation of supporting tasks that are linked to its depositary tasks, such as administrative or technical functions performed by the depositary as a part of its depositary tasks, is not subject to the specific limitations and requirements set out in this Directive.\n(43)\nThis Directive also takes account of the fact that many AIFs, and in particular hedge funds, currently make use of a prime broker. This Directive ensures that AIFs may continue to use the function of prime brokers. However, unless it has functionally and hierarchically separated the performance of its depositary functions from its tasks as prime broker and the potential conflicts of interest are properly identified, managed and disclosed to the investors of the AIF, no prime broker should be appointed as a depositary, since prime brokers act as counterparties to AIFs and therefore cannot at the same time act in the best interest of the AIF as is required of a depositary. Depositaries should be able to delegate custody tasks to one or more prime brokers or other third parties. In addition to the delegated custody tasks prime brokers should be allowed to provide prime brokerage services to the AIF. Those prime brokerage services should not form part of the delegation arrangement.\n(44)\nThe depositary should be liable for the losses suffered by the AIFM, the AIF and the investors. This Directive distinguishes between the loss of financial instruments held in custody, and any other losses. In the case of a loss other than of financial instruments held in custody, the depositary should be liable in the case of intent or negligence. Where the depositary holds assets in custody and those assets are lost, the depositary should be liable, unless it can prove that the loss is the result of an external event beyond its reasonable control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable efforts to the contrary. In this context, a depositary should not, for example, be able to rely on internal situations such as a fraudulent act by an employee to discharge itself of liability.\n(45)\nWhere the depositary delegates custody tasks and the financial instruments held in custody by a third party are lost, the depositary should be liable. However, provided that the depositary is expressly allowed to discharge itself of liability subject to a contractual transfer of such liability to that third party, pursuant to a written contract between the depositary and the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF, in which such a discharge is objectively justified, and that the third party can be held liable for the loss based on a contract between the depositary and the third party, the depositary should be able to discharge itself of liability if it can prove that it has exercised due skill, care and diligence and that the specific requirements for delegation are met. By imposing the requirement of a contractual transfer of liability to the third party, this Directive intends to attach external effects to such contract, making the third party directly liable to the AIF, or to the investors of the AIF, for the loss of the financial instruments held in custody.\n(46)\nFurther, where the law of a third country requires that certain financial instruments be held in custody by a local entity and there are no local entities that satisfy all depositary delegation requirements, the depositary should be able to discharge itself of liability provided that: the rules or instruments of incorporation of the AIF concerned expressly allow for such a discharge; the investors have been duly informed of that discharge and the circumstances justifying the discharge prior to their investment; the AIF or the AIFM on behalf of the AIF instructed the depositary to delegate the custody of such financial instruments to a local entity; there is a written contract between the depositary and the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF, which expressly allows such a discharge; and there is a written contract between the depositary and the third party which expressly transfers the liability of the depositary to that third party and makes it possible for the AIF, or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF, to make a claim against the third party in respect of the loss of financial instruments or for the depositary to make such a claim on their behalf.\n(47)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to any future legislative measures with respect to the depositary in Directive 2009/65/EC, because UCITS and AIFs are different both in the investment strategies they follow and in the type of investors for which they are intended.\n(48)\nAn AIFM should, for each of the EU AIFs it manages and for each of the AIFs it markets in the Union, make available an annual report for each financial year no later than 6 months following the end of the financial year in accordance with this Directive. That 6-month period should be without prejudice to the right of the Member States to impose a shorter period.\n(49)\nGiven that it is possible for an AIFM to employ leverage and, under certain conditions, to contribute to the build up of systemic risk or disorderly markets, special requirements should be imposed on AIFMs employing leverage. The information needed to detect, monitor and respond to those risks has not been collected in a consistent way throughout the Union, and shared across Member States so as to identify potential sources of risk to the stability of financial markets in the Union. To remedy that situation, special requirements should apply to AIFMs which employ leverage on a substantial basis at the level of the AIF. Such AIFMs should be required to disclose information regarding the overall level of leverage employed, the leverage arising from borrowing of cash or securities and the leverage arising from positions held in derivatives, the reuse of assets and the main sources of leverage in their AIFs. Information gathered by competent authorities should be shared with other authorities in the Union, with ESMA and with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) established by Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on European Union macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (13) so as to facilitate a collective analysis of the impact of the leverage of AIFs managed by AIFMs on the financial system in the Union, as well as a common response. If one or more AIFs managed by an AIFM could potentially constitute an important source of counterparty risk to a credit institution or other systemically relevant institutions in other Member States, such information should also be shared with the relevant authorities.\n(50)\nIn order to ensure a proper assessment of the risks induced by the use of leverage by an AIFM with respect to the AIFs it manages, the AIFM should demonstrate that the leverage limits for each AIF it manages are reasonable and that it complies with those limits at all times. Where the stability and integrity of the financial system may be threatened, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM should be able to impose limits to the level of leverage that an AIFM can employ in AIFs under its management. ESMA and the ESRB should be informed about any actions taken in this respect.\n(51)\nIt is also considered necessary to allow ESMA, after taking into account the advice of the ESRB, to determine that the leverage used by an AIFM or by a group of AIFMs poses a substantial risk to the stability and the integrity of the financial system and to issue advice to competent authorities specifying the remedial measures to be taken.\n(52)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, the companies over which AIFs managed by an AIFM exercise control and the employees of such companies receive certain information necessary for those companies to assess how that control will impact their situation.\n(53)\nWhere AIFMs manage AIFs which exercise control over an issuer whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market, information should generally be disclosed in accordance with Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on takeover bids (14) and Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market (15). Specific requirements should apply to AIFMs managing AIFs which exercise control over a non-listed company. In order to ensure transparency regarding the controlled company, enhanced transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements should apply. Further, the annual reports of the relevant AIF should be supplemented with regard to the controlled company or such additional information should be included in the annual report of the controlled company. Such information should be made available to the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves, and to the investors of the relevant AIF.\n(54)\nSpecific information requirements towards employees of certain companies apply in cases where AIFs acquire control over such companies in accordance with this Directive. However, in most cases the AIFM has no control over the AIF, unless it is an internally managed AIF. Furthermore, there is, in accordance with the general principles of company law, no direct relationship between the shareholders and the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves. For those reasons, no direct information requirements towards the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves, can be imposed pursuant to this Directive on a shareholder or its manager, namely the AIF and the AIFM. As regards the information requirements towards such employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves, this Directive should provide for an obligation on the AIFM concerned to use its best efforts to ensure that the board of directors of the company concerned discloses the relevant information to the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves.\n(55)\nThe Commission is invited to examine the need and the possibilities to amend the information and disclosure requirements applicable in cases of control over non-listed companies or issuers set out in this Directive on a general level, regardless of the type of investor.\n(56)\nWhere an AIFM manages one or more AIFs which acquire control over a non-listed company, the AIFM should provide the competent authorities of its home Member State with information on the financing of the acquisition. That obligation to provide information on financing should also apply when an AIFM manages AIFs which acquire control over an issuer of shares admitted to trading on a regulated market.\n(57)\nWhere an AIFM manages one or more AIFs which acquire control over a non-listed company or an issuer, the AIFM should, for a period of 24 months following the acquisition of control of the company by the AIFs, first, not be allowed to facilitate, support or instruct any distribution, capital reduction, share redemption and/or acquisition of own shares by the company in accordance with this Directive; second, in so far as the AIFM is authorised to vote on behalf of the AIFs at the meetings of governing bodies of the company, not vote in favour of a distribution, capital reduction, share redemption and/or acquisition of own shares by the company in accordance with this Directive; and third, in any event, use its best efforts to prevent distributions, capital reductions, share redemptions and/or the acquisition of own shares by the company in accordance with this Directive. When transposing this Directive into national law, the Member States should take into account the regulatory purpose of the provisions of Section 2 of Chapter V of this Directive and take due account in this context of the need for a level playing field between EU AIFs and non-EU AIFs when acquiring control in companies established in the Union.\n(58)\nThe notification and disclosure requirements and the specific safeguards against asset stripping in the case of control over a non-listed company or an issuer should be subject to a general exception for control over small and medium-sized enterprises and special purpose vehicles with the purpose of purchasing, holding or administrating real estate. Further, those requirements do not aim at making public proprietary information which would put the AIFM at a disadvantage vis-à-vis potential competitors such as sovereign wealth funds or competitors that may want to put the target company out of business by using the information to their advantage. The obligations to notify and disclose information should therefore apply subject to the conditions and restrictions relating to confidential information set out in Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community (16) and without prejudice to Directives 2004/25/EC and 2004/109/EC. This means that Member States should provide that within the limits and conditions laid down by national law the employees’ representatives, and anyone assisting them, are not authorised to reveal to employees and to third parties any information affecting the legitimate interests of the company that has expressly been provided to them in confidence. Member States should, however, be able to authorise the employees’ representatives and anyone assisting them to pass on confidential information to employees and to third parties bound by an obligation of confidentiality. Member States should provide that the relevant AIFMs do not request the communication of information by the board of directors to the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves, when the nature of that information is such that, according to objective criteria, it would seriously harm the functioning of the company concerned or would be prejudicial to it. The notification and disclosure requirements and the specific safeguards against asset stripping should also apply without prejudice to any stricter rules adopted by Member States.\n(59)\nThis Directive also lays down the conditions subject to which EU AIFMs may market the units or shares of EU AIFs to professional investors in the Union. Such marketing by EU AIFMs should be allowed only in so far as the AIFM complies with this Directive and the marketing occurs with a passport, without prejudice to the marketing of AIFs by AIFMs falling below the thresholds provided for in this Directive. It should be possible for Member States to allow marketing of AIFs by AIFMs falling below those thresholds subject to national provisions.\n(60)\nIt should be possible for units or shares of an AIF to be listed on a regulated market in the Union, or offered or placed by third parties acting on behalf of the AIFM, in a particular Member State only if the AIFM which manages the AIF is itself permitted to market the units or shares of the AIF in that Member State. In addition, other national and Union law, such as Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading (17) and Directive 2004/39/EC, may also regulate the distribution of AIFs to investors in the Union.\n(61)\nMany EU AIFMs currently manage non-EU AIFs. It is appropriate to allow authorised EU AIFMs to manage non-EU AIFs without marketing them in the Union without imposing on them the strict depositary requirements and the requirements relating to the annual report provided for in this Directive, as those requirements have been included for the protection of Union investors.\n(62)\nAfter the entry into force of a delegated act adopted by the Commission in this regard, which will, in principle, taking into account the advice provided by ESMA, occur 2 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, authorised EU AIFMs intending to market non-EU AIFs to professional investors in their home Member State and/or in other Member States should be allowed to do so with a passport in so far as they comply with this Directive. That right should be subject to notification procedures and conditions in relation to the third country of the non-EU AIF.\n(63)\nDuring a transitional period, which will, in principle, taking into account ESMA’s advice, be brought to an end by means of a delegated act 3 years after the establishment of the passport for non-EU AIFMs, EU AIFMs intending to market non-EU AIFs in certain Member States, but without a passport, should also be permitted to do so by the relevant Member States, but only in so far as they comply with this Directive with the exception of the depositary requirements. Such EU AIFMs should, however, ensure that one or more entities are appointed to carry out the duties of the depositary. In addition, appropriate cooperation arrangements for the purpose of systemic risk oversight and in line with international standards should be in place between the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM and the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIF is established in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information that allows the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive. The cooperation arrangements should not be used as a barrier to impede non-EU AIFs from being marketed in a Member State. Further, the third country where the non-EU AIF is established should not be listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by the Financial Action Task Force on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (FATF).\n(64)\nAfter the entry into force of a delegated act adopted by the Commission in that regard, which will, in principle, taking into account advice given by ESMA, occur 2 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, a basic principle of this Directive should be that a non-EU AIFM is to benefit from the rights conferred under this Directive, such as to market units or shares of AIFs throughout the Union with a passport, subject to its compliance with this Directive. This should ensure a level playing field between EU and non-EU AIFMs. This Directive therefore provides for an authorisation applicable to non-EU AIFMs which will become applicable after the entry into force of the delegated act adopted by the Commission in this regard. To ensure that such compliance is enforced, the competent authorities of a Member State should enforce compliance with this Directive. For such non-EU AIFMs the competent supervisory authorities should be the competent authorities of the Member State of reference, as defined in this Directive.\n(65)\nTherefore, where a non-EU AIFM intends to manage EU AIFs and/or market AIFs in the Union with a passport, it should also be required to comply with this Directive, so that it is subject to the same obligations as EU AIFMs. In very exceptional circumstances, if and to the extent compliance with a provision of this Directive is incompatible with compliance with the law to which the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU AIF marketed in the Union is subject, it should be possible for the non-EU AIFM to be exempted from compliance with the relevant provision of this Directive if it can demonstrate that: it is impossible to combine compliance with a provision of this Directive with compliance with a mandatory provision in the law to which the non-EU AIFM or the non- EU AIF marketed in the Union is subject; the law to which the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU AIF is subject provides for an equivalent rule having the same regulatory purpose and offering the same level of protection to the investors of the relevant AIF; and the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU AIF complies with that equivalent rule.\n(66)\nFurther, a non-EU AIFM intending to manage EU AIFs and/or market AIFs in the Union with a passport should comply with a specific authorisation procedure and certain specific requirements concerning the third country of the non-EU AIFM and, as appropriate, the third country of the non-EU AIF should be satisfied.\n(67)\nESMA should provide advice on the determination of the Member State of reference, and, where relevant, the exemption as regards compatibility with an equivalent rule. Specific requirements for the exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member State of reference and the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM should apply. Further, the mediation procedure provided for in Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 should apply in case of disagreement between competent authorities of Member States on the determination of the Member State of reference, the application of the exemption in case of incompatibility between compliance with this Directive and compliance with equivalent rules of a third country, and the assessment regarding the fulfilment of the specific requirements concerning the third country of the non-EU AIFM and, as appropriate, the third country of the non-EU AIF.\n(68)\nESMA should, on an annual basis, conduct a peer review analysis of the supervisory activities of the competent authorities in relation to the authorisation and the supervision of non-EU AIFMs, to further enhance consistency in supervisory outcomes, in accordance with Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n(69)\nDuring a transitional period which will, in principle, taking into account ESMA’s advice, be brought to an end by means of a delegated act 3 years after the establishment of the passport for non-EU AIFMs, a non-EU AIFM intending to market AIFs in certain Member States only and without such a passport should also be permitted to do so by the relevant Member States, but only in so far as certain minimum conditions are met. Those non-EU AIFMs should be subject at least to rules similar to those applicable to EU AIFMs managing EU AIFs with respect to the disclosure to investors. In order to facilitate the monitoring of systemic risk those non-EU AIFMs should also be subject to reporting obligations vis-à-vis the competent authorities of the Member State in which AIFs are marketed. Such AIFMs should therefore comply with the transparency requirements laid down in this Directive and the obligations on AIFMs managing AIFs which acquire control of non-listed companies and issuers. Further, appropriate cooperation arrangements for the purpose of systemic risk oversight and in line with international standards should be in place between the competent authorities of the Member States where the AIFs are marketed, if applicable, the competent authorities of the EU AIFs concerned and the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIFM is established and, if applicable, the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIF is established in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information that allows competent authorities of the relevant Member States to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive. The cooperation arrangements should not be used as a barrier to impede third country funds from being marketed in a Member State. Finally, the third country where the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU AIF is established should not be listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by FATF.\n(70)\nThis Directive should not affect the current situation, whereby a professional investor established in the Union may invest in AIFs on its own initiative, irrespective of where the AIFM and/or the AIF is established.\n(71)\nMember States should be able to allow the marketing of all or certain types of AIFs managed by AIFMs to retail investors in their territory. If a Member State allows the marketing of certain types of AIF, the Member State should make an assessment on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a specific AIF should be considered as a type of AIF which may be marketed to retail investors in its territory. Without prejudice to the application of other instruments of Union law, Member States should in such cases be able to impose stricter requirements on AIFs and AIFMs as a precondition for marketing to retail investors than is the case for AIFs marketed to professional investors in their territory, irrespective of whether such AIFs are marketed on a domestic or cross-border basis. Where a Member State allows the marketing of AIFs to retail investors in its territory, this possibility should be available regardless of the Member State where the AIFM managing the AIFs is established, and Member States should not impose stricter or additional requirements on EU AIFs established in another Member State and marketed on a cross-border basis than on AIFs marketed domestically. In addition, AIFMs, investment firms authorised under Directive 2004/39/EC and credit institutions authorised under Directive 2006/48/EC which provide investment services to retail clients should take into account any additional requirements when assessing whether a certain AIF is suitable or appropriate for an individual retail client or whether it is a complex or non-complex financial instrument.\n(72)\nIt is necessary to clarify the powers and duties of the competent authorities responsible for implementing this Directive, and to strengthen the mechanisms necessary to ensure effective cross-border supervisory cooperation. Under certain circumstances it should be possible for the competent authorities of the host Member States of an AIFM to take direct action to supervise compliance with provisions for which they are responsible. For other provisions the competent authorities of the host Member States should under certain circumstances be allowed to request action from the competent authorities of the home Member State and to intervene if no such action is undertaken.\n(73)\nThis Directive provides for a general coordinating role for ESMA, and the possibility of binding mediation procedures, chaired by ESMA, to resolve disputes between competent authorities.\n(74)\nESMA should develop draft regulatory technical standards on the contents of the cooperation arrangements that must be concluded by the home Member State or by the Member State of reference of the AIFM and the relevant third-country supervisory authorities and on the procedures for the exchange of information. The draft regulatory technical standards should ensure that pursuant to those cooperation arrangements all necessary information is to be provided to enable the competent authorities of both the home and the host Member States to exercise their supervisory and investigatory powers under this Directive. ESMA should also have a facilitating role in the negotiation and conclusion of the cooperation arrangements. For example, ESMA should be able to use its facilitating role by providing for a standard format for such cooperation arrangements.\n(75)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. The penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(76)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, in the TFEU and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter), in particular the right to the protection of personal data recognised in Article 16 TFEU and in Article 8 of the Charter. Any exchange or transmission of information by competent authorities should be in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (18). Any exchange or transmission of information by ESMA should be in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (19), which should be fully applicable to the processing of personal data for the purposes of this Directive.\n(77)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (20).\n(78)\nThe Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU where expressly provided for in this Directive. In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to specify the methods of leverage as defined in this Directive, including any financial and/or legal structures involving third parties controlled by the relevant AIF where those structures are specifically set up to directly or indirectly create leverage at the level of the AIF. In particular for private equity and venture capital funds this means that leverage that exists at the level of a portfolio company is not intended to be included when referring to such financial or legal structures.\n(79)\nDelegated acts should also be adopted to specify how to calculate the thresholds for the lighter regime and how to treat AIFMs whose assets under management, including any assets acquired through use of leverage, in one and the same calendar year occasionally exceed and/or fall below the relevant threshold; to specify the obligations to register for the AIFMs falling below the thresholds and to provide information in order to effectively monitor systemic risk and the obligation for such AIFMs to notify the relevant competent authorities where they no longer fulfil the conditions for application of the lighter regime.\n(80)\nDelegated acts should also be adopted to clarify the methods of leverage, including any financial and/or legal structures involving third parties controlled by the relevant AIF and how leverage is to be calculated; to specify the risks the additional own funds or the professional indemnity insurance must cover, the conditions for determining the appropriateness of additional own funds or the coverage of the professional indemnity insurance, and the manner of determining ongoing adjustments of the additional own funds or of the coverage of the professional indemnity insurance. Delegated acts should also be adopted to specify the criteria to be used by competent authorities to assess whether AIFMs comply with their obligations as regards their conduct of business, their obligation to act in the best interests of the AIFs or the investors of the AIFs they manage and the integrity of the market; to have and employ effectively the resources and procedures that are necessary for the proper performance of their business activities; to take all reasonable steps to avoid conflicts of interest and, where such conflicts cannot be avoided, to identify, manage and monitor, and where applicable, disclose, those conflicts of interest in order to prevent them from adversely affecting the interests of the AIFs and their investors and to ensure that the AIFs they manage are fairly treated; to comply with all regulatory requirements applicable to the conduct of their business activities so as to promote the best interests of the AIFs or the investors of the AIFs they manage and the integrity of the market; and to treat all AIF investors fairly.\n(81)\nDelegated acts should also be adopted to specify the type of conflicts of interest AIFMs have to identify, as well as the reasonable steps AIFMs are expected to take in terms of structures and organisational and administrative procedures in order to identify, prevent, manage, monitor and disclose conflicts of interest. Delegated acts should also be adopted to specify the risk management functions to be employed; the appropriate frequency for review of the risk management system; how the risk management function should be functionally and hierarchically separated from the operating units, including the portfolio management function; the specific safeguards against conflicts of interest; and the risk management requirements to be employed by AIFMs. Delegated acts should also be adopted to specify the liquidity management systems and procedures that AIFMs should employ and the alignment of the investment strategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy. Delegated acts should also be adopted to specify the requirements that the originators, the sponsors or the original lenders of securitisation instruments have to meet in order for an AIFM to be allowed to invest in such instruments issued after 1 January 2011.\n(82)\nDelegated acts should also be adopted to specify the requirements that AIFMs have to comply with when investing in such securitisation instruments; to specify administrative and accounting procedures, control and safeguard arrangements for electronic data processing and adequate internal control mechanisms; to specify the procedures for the proper valuation of the assets and the calculation of the net asset value per unit or share of the AIF, the professional guarantees the external valuer must be able to provide, and the frequency for valuation appropriate for open-ended AIFs.\n(83)\nDelegated acts should also be adopted to specify the conditions subject to which the delegation of AIFM functions should be approved and the conditions subject to which the AIFM has delegated its functions to the extent that it becomes a letter-box entity and can no longer be considered to be the manager of the AIF; as regards depositaries, to specify the criteria for assessing that the prudential regulation and supervision of third countries where the depositaries are established have the same effect as Union law and are effectively enforced, the particulars that need to be included in the standard agreement, the conditions for performing the depositary functions, including the type of financial instruments that should be included in the scope of the depositary’s custody duties, the conditions subject to which the depositary may exercise its custody duties over financial instruments registered with a central depositary and the conditions subject to which the depositary should safekeep the financial instruments issued in a nominative form and registered with an issuer or a registrar, the due diligence duties of depositaries, the segregation obligation, the conditions subject to and circumstances in which financial instruments held in custody should be considered as lost, what is to be understood by external events beyond reasonable control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable efforts to the contrary, and the conditions subject to and circumstances in which there is an objective reason to contract a discharge of liability. Delegated acts should also be adopted to specify the content and format of the annual report that AIFMs have to make available for each AIF they manage and to specify the disclosure obligations of AIFMs to investors and reporting requirements to competent authorities as well as their frequency.\n(84)\nDelegated acts should also be adopted to specify when leverage is considered to be employed on a substantial basis and the principles competent authorities should use when considering imposing limits to the level of leverage that an AIFM can apply. Delegated acts should also be adopted to specify the cooperation arrangements in relation to non-EU AIFMs and/or non-EU AIFs in order to design a common framework to facilitate the establishment of those cooperation arrangements with third countries. Delegated acts should also be adopted to specify the content of exchange of information regarding AIFMs between competent authorities and the provision of certain information to ESMA.\n(85)\nDepending on the advice of ESMA in this regard and the criteria set out in this Directive, a delegated act should also be adopted in order to extend the passport to EU AIFMs marketing non-EU AIFs in the Union and to non-EU AIFMs managing and/or marketing AIFs in the Union, and another delegated act should be adopted to terminate the application of national private placement regimes in this regard.\n(86)\nThe European Parliament and the Council should have 3 months from the date of notification to object to a delegated act. At the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council, it should be possible to prolong that period by 3 months in regard to significant areas of concern. It should also be possible for the European Parliament and the Council to inform the other institutions of their intention not to raise objections. Such early approval of delegated acts is particularly important where deadlines need to be met, for example to allow Member States to transpose delegated acts within the transposition period laid down in this Directive, where relevant.\n(87)\nIn the Declaration on Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, the Conference took note of the Commission’s intention to consult experts appointed by the Member States in the preparation of draft delegated acts in the financial services area, in accordance with its established practice.\n(88)\n2 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, ESMA should issue an opinion on the functioning of the passport then in force and on the functioning of national private placement regimes. It should also issue advice on the extension of the passport to EU AIFMs marketing non-EU AIFs in the Union and to non-EU AIFMs managing and/or marketing AIFs in the Union. The Commission should adopt a delegated act within 3 months after having received that opinion and advice from ESMA and taking into account the criteria listed in, and the objectives of, this Directive, inter alia, regarding the internal market, investor protection and the effective monitoring of systemic risk, specifying the date when the rules relating to the extension of the passport provided for in this Directive should become applicable in all Member States.\n(89)\nAt the April 2009 summit in London, G20 Leaders agreed that hedge funds or their managers should be registered and should be required to disclose appropriate information on an ongoing basis to supervisors or regulators. They should be subject to oversight to ensure that they have adequate risk management. In June 2010, G20 Leaders in Toronto reaffirmed their commitment and also committed to accelerate the implementation of strong measures to improve transparency and regulatory oversight of hedge funds in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way. In order to support the G20 objectives, the International Organization of Securities Commissions issued high level principles of hedge fund oversight in June 2009 to guide the development of internationally consistent regulation in this area. On 16 September 2010 the European Council agreed on the need for Europe to promote its interest and values more assertively and in a spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit in the context of the Union’s external relations and to take steps to, inter alia, secure greater market access for European business and deepen regulatory cooperation with major trade partners. The Commission will endeavour to ensure that these commitments are implemented in a similar way by the Union’s international partners.\n(90)\n3 years after the entry into force of the delegated act pursuant to which the passport is to apply to all AIFMs, ESMA should issue an opinion on the functioning of the passport then in force and on the functioning of national private placement regimes. It should also issue advice on the termination of those national regimes. The Commission should adopt a delegated act within 3 months of receipt of the opinion and advice from ESMA, taking into account the criteria listed in, and the objectives of, this Directive, inter alia, relating to the internal market, investor protection and the effective monitoring of systemic risk, specifying the date when the national regimes referred to in this Directive should be brought to an end in all Member States.\n(91)\n4 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, the Commission should, on the basis of public consultation and in the light of the discussions with competent authorities, commence a review of the application and the scope of this Directive. That review should analyse the experience acquired in applying this Directive, its impact on investors, AIFs or AIFMs, in the Union and in third countries, and the extent to which the objectives of this Directive have been achieved, if necessary proposing appropriate amendments. That review should include a general survey of the functioning of the rules laid down in this Directive and the experience acquired in applying them. The Commission should in its review examine the functions of ESMA and the Union competent authorities in ensuring effective supervision of all AIFMs operating in the Union markets in the context of this Directive, including, inter alia – in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 – entrusting ESMA with further supervisory responsibilities in the field of authorisation and supervision of non-EU AIFMs. In this context the Commission should assess the costs and benefits of entrusting ESMA with such tasks.\n(92)\nThis Directive aims at establishing a framework capable of addressing the potential risks which might arise from the activities of AIFMs and ensuring the effective monitoring of those risks by the competent authorities within the Union. It is necessary to provide for a stringent regulatory and supervisory framework which leaves no gaps in financial regulation. In that regard reference is made to the existing due diligence requirements applicable to professional investors pursuant to the relevant regulation applicable to such investors. The Commission is invited to review the relevant legislation with respect to professional investors in order to assess the need for tighter requirements regarding the due diligence process to be undertaken by Union professional investors investing on their own initiative in non-EU financial products, such as non-EU AIFs.\n(93)\nAt the end of its review, the Commission should present a report to the European Parliament and the Council including, if appropriate, proposed amendments taking into account the objectives of this Directive and potential impacts on investors, AIFs or AIFMs, in the Union and in third countries.\n(94)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure a high level of investor protection by laying down a common framework for the authorisation and supervision of AIFMs, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, as evidenced by the deficiencies of existing nationally based regulation and oversight of those actors, and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(95)\nDirectives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC, Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies (21) and Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down the rules for the authorisation, ongoing operation and transparency of the managers of alternative investment funds (AIFMs) which manage and/or market alternative investment funds (AIFs) in the Union.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article and to Article 3, this Directive shall apply to:\n(a)\nEU AIFMs which manage one or more AIFs irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs;\n(b)\nnon-EU AIFMs which manage one or more EU AIFs; and\n(c)\nnon-EU AIFMs which market one or more AIFs in the Union irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the following shall be of no significance:\n(a)\nwhether the AIF belongs to the open-ended or closed-ended type;\n(b)\nwhether the AIF is constituted under the law of contract, under trust law, under statute, or has any other legal form;\n(c)\nthe legal structure of the AIFM.\n3.   This Directive shall not apply to the following entities:\n(a)\nholding companies;\n(b)\ninstitutions for occupational retirement provision which are covered by Directive 2003/41/EC, including, where applicable, the authorised entities responsible for managing such institutions and acting on their behalf referred to in Article 2(1) of that Directive or the investment managers appointed pursuant to Article 19(1) of that Directive, in so far as they do not manage AIFs;\n(c)\nsupranational institutions, such as the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Development Finance Institutions and bilateral development banks, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other supranational institutions and similar international organisations, in the event that such institutions or organisations manage AIFs and in so far as those AIFs act in the public interest;\n(d)\nnational central banks;\n(e)\nnational, regional and local governments and bodies or other institutions which manage funds supporting social security and pension systems;\n(f)\nemployee participation schemes or employee savings schemes;\n(g)\nsecuritisation special purpose entities.\n4.   Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that AIFMs referred to in paragraph 1 comply with this Directive at all times.\nArticle 3\nExemptions\n1.

Member States shall ensure that, at all times, AIFMs:\n(a)\nact honestly, with due skill, care and diligence and fairly in conducting their activities;\n(b)\nact in the best interests of the AIFs or the investors of the AIFs they manage and the integrity of the market;\n(c)\nhave and employ effectively the resources and procedures that are necessary for the proper performance of their business activities;\n(d)\ntake all reasonable steps to avoid conflicts of interest and, when they cannot be avoided, to identify, manage and monitor and, where applicable, disclose, those conflicts of interest in order to prevent them from adversely affecting the interests of the AIFs and their investors and to ensure that the AIFs they manage are fairly treated;\n(e)\ncomply with all regulatory requirements applicable to the conduct of their business activities so as to promote the best interests of the AIFs or the investors of the AIFs they manage and the integrity of the market;\n(f)\ntreat all AIF investors fairly.\nNo investor in an AIF shall obtain preferential treatment, unless such preferential treatment is disclosed in the relevant AIF’s rules or instruments of incorporation.\n2.   Each AIFM the authorisation of which also covers the discretionary portfolio management service referred to in point (a) of Article 6(4) shall:\n(a)\nnot be permitted to invest all or part of the client’s portfolio in units or shares of the AIFs it manages, unless it receives prior general approval from the client;\n(b)\nwith regard to the services referred to in Article 6(4), be subject to Directive 97/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 March 1997 on investor-compensation schemes (25).\n3.

Member States shall require AIFMs to have remuneration policies and practices for those categories of staff, including senior management, risk takers, control functions, and any employees receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers, whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profiles of the AIFMs or of the AIFs they manage, that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management and do not encourage risk-taking which is inconsistent with the risk profiles, rules or instruments of incorporation of the AIFs they manage.\nThe AIFMs shall determine the remuneration policies and practices in accordance with Annex II.\n2.   ESMA shall ensure the existence of guidelines on sound remuneration policies which comply with Annex II. The guidelines shall take into account the principles on sound remuneration policies set out in Recommendation 2009/384/EC, the size of the AIFMs and the size of AIFs they manage, their internal organisation and the nature, the scope and the complexity of their activities. ESMA shall cooperate closely with the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA).\nArticle 14\nConflicts of interest\n1.   Member States shall require AIFMs to take all reasonable steps to identify conflicts of interest that arise in the course of managing AIFs between:\n(a)\nthe AIFM, including its managers, employees or any person directly or indirectly linked to the AIFM by control, and the AIF managed by the AIFM or the investors in that AIF;\n(b)\nthe AIF or the investors in that AIF, and another AIF or the investors in that AIF;\n(c)\nthe AIF or the investors in that AIF, and another client of the AIFM;\n(d)\nthe AIF or the investors in that AIF, and a UCITS managed by the AIFM or the investors in that UCITS; or\n(e)\ntwo clients of the AIFM.\nAIFMs shall maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps designed to identify, prevent, manage and monitor conflicts of interest in order to prevent them from adversely affecting the interests of the AIFs and their investors.\nAIFMs shall segregate, within their own operating environment, tasks and responsibilities which may be regarded as incompatible with each other or which may potentially generate systematic conflicts of interest. AIFMs shall assess whether their operating conditions may involve any other material conflicts of interest and disclose them to the investors of the AIFs.\n2.   Where organisational arrangements made by the AIFM to identify, prevent, manage and monitor conflicts of interest are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that risks of damage to investors’ interests will be prevented, the AIFM shall clearly disclose the general nature or sources of conflicts of interest to the investors before undertaking business on their behalf, and develop appropriate policies and procedures.\n3.   Where the AIFM on behalf of an AIF uses the services of a prime broker, the terms shall be set out in a written contract. In particular any possibility of transfer and reuse of AIF assets shall be provided for in that contract and shall comply with the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation. The contract shall provide that the depositary be informed of the contract.\nAIFMs shall exercise due skill, care and diligence in the selection and appointment of prime brokers with whom a contract is to be concluded.\n4.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying:\n(a)\nthe types of conflicts of interest as referred to in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nthe reasonable steps AIFMs are expected to take in terms of structures and organisational and administrative procedures in order to identify, prevent, manage, monitor and disclose conflicts of interest.\nArticle 15\nRisk management\n1.   AIFMs shall functionally and hierarchically separate the functions of risk management from the operating units, including from the functions of portfolio management.\nThe functional and hierarchical separation of the functions of risk management in accordance with the first subparagraph shall be reviewed by the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM in accordance with the principle of proportionality, on the understanding that the AIFM shall, in any event, be able to demonstrate that specific safeguards against conflicts of interest allow for the independent performance of risk management activities and that the risk management process satisfies the requirements of this Article and is consistently effective.\n2.   AIFMs shall implement adequate risk management systems in order to identify, measure, manage and monitor appropriately all risks relevant to each AIF investment strategy and to which each AIF is or may be exposed.\nAIFMs shall review the risk management systems with appropriate frequency at least once a year and adapt them whenever necessary.\n3.   AIFMs shall at least:\n(a)\nimplement an appropriate, documented and regularly updated due diligence process when investing on behalf of the AIF, according to the investment strategy, the objectives and risk profile of the AIF;\n(b)\nensure that the risks associated with each investment position of the AIF and their overall effect on the AIF’s portfolio can be properly identified, measured, managed and monitored on an ongoing basis, including through the use of appropriate stress testing procedures;\n(c)\nensure that the risk profile of the AIF shall correspond to the size, portfolio structure and investment strategies and objectives of the AIF as laid down in the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation, prospectus and offering documents.\n4.   AIFMs shall set a maximum level of leverage which they may employ on behalf of each AIF they manage as well as the extent of the right to reuse collateral or guarantee that could be granted under the leveraging arrangement, taking into account, inter alia:\n(a)\nthe type of the AIF;\n(b)\nthe investment strategy of the AIF;\n(c)\nthe sources of leverage of the AIF;\n(d)\nany other interlinkage or relevant relationships with other financial services institutions, which could pose systemic risk;\n(e)\nthe need to limit the exposure to any single counterparty;\n(f)\nthe extent to which the leverage is collateralised;\n(g)\nthe asset-liability ratio;\n(h)\nthe scale, nature and extent of the activity of the AIFM on the markets concerned.\n5.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying:\n(a)\nthe risk management systems to be employed by AIFMs in relation to the risks which they incur on behalf of the AIFs that they manage;\n(b)\nthe appropriate frequency of review of the risk management system;\n(c)\nhow the risk management function is to be functionally and hierarchically separated from the operating units, including the portfolio management function;\n(d)\nspecific safeguards against conflicts of interest referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1;\n(e)\nthe requirements referred to in paragraph 3.\nArticle 16\nLiquidity management\n1.   AIFMs shall, for each AIF that they manage which is not an unleveraged closed-ended AIF, employ an appropriate liquidity management system and adopt procedures which enable them to monitor the liquidity risk of the AIF and to ensure that the liquidity profile of the investments of the AIF complies with its underlying obligations.\nAIFMs shall regularly conduct stress tests, under normal and exceptional liquidity conditions, which enable them to assess the liquidity risk of the AIFs and monitor the liquidity risk of the AIFs accordingly.\n2.   AIFMs shall ensure that, for each AIF that they manage, the investment strategy, the liquidity profile and the redemption policy are consistent.\n3.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying:\n(a)\nthe liquidity management systems and procedures; and\n(b)\nthe alignment of the investment strategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy set out in paragraph 2.\nArticle 17\nInvestment in securitisation positions\nIn order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency and to remove misalignment between the interest of firms that repackage loans into tradable securities and originators within the meaning of point (41) of Article 4 of Directive 2006/48/EC, and AIFMs that invest in those securities or other financial instruments on behalf of AIFs, the Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures laying down the requirements in the following areas:\n(a)\nthe requirements that need to be met by the originator, the sponsor or the original lender, in order for an AIFM to be allowed to invest in securities or other financial instruments of this type issued after 1 January 2011 on behalf of AIFs, including requirements that ensure that the originator, the sponsor or the original lender retains a net economic interest of not less than 5 %;\n(b)\nqualitative requirements that must be met by AIFMs which invest in these securities or other financial instruments on behalf of one or more AIFs.\nSECTION 2\nOrganisational requirements\nArticle 18\nGeneral principles\n1.   Member States shall require that AIFMs use, at all times, adequate and appropriate human and technical resources that are necessary for the proper management of AIFs.\nIn particular, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, having regard also to the nature of the AIFs managed by the AIFM, shall require that the AIFM has sound administrative and accounting procedures, control and safeguard arrangements for electronic data processing and adequate internal control mechanisms including, in particular, rules for personal transactions by its employees or for the holding or management of investments in order to invest on its own account and ensuring, at least, that each transaction involving the AIFs may be reconstructed according to its origin, the parties to it, its nature, and the time and place at which it was effected and that the assets of the AIFs managed by the AIFM are invested in accordance with the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation and the legal provisions in force.\n2.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying the procedures and arrangements as referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 19\nValuation\n1.   AIFMs shall ensure that, for each AIF that they manage, appropriate and consistent procedures are established so that a proper and independent valuation of the assets of the AIF can be performed in accordance with this Article, the applicable national law and the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation.\n2.   The rules applicable to the valuation of assets and the calculation of the net asset value per unit or share of the AIF shall be laid down in the law of the country where the AIF is established and/or in the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation.\n3.   AIFMs shall also ensure that the net asset value per unit or share of AIFs is calculated and disclosed to the investors in accordance with this Article, the applicable national law and the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation.\nThe valuation procedures used shall ensure that the assets are valued and the net asset value per unit or share is calculated at least once a year.\nIf the AIF is of the open-ended type, such valuations and calculations shall also be carried out at a frequency which is both appropriate to the assets held by the AIF and its issuance and redemption frequency.\nIf the AIF is of the closed-ended type, such valuations and calculations shall also be carried out in case of an increase or decrease of the capital by the relevant AIF.\nThe investors shall be informed of the valuations and calculations as set out in the relevant AIF rules or instruments of incorporation.\n4.   AIFMs shall ensure that the valuation function is either performed by:\n(a)\nan external valuer, being a legal or natural person independent from the AIF, the AIFM and any other persons with close links to the AIF or the AIFM; or\n(b)\nthe AIFM itself, provided that the valuation task is functionally independent from the portfolio management and the remuneration policy and other measures ensure that conflicts of interest are mitigated and that undue influence upon the employees is prevented.\nThe depositary appointed for an AIF shall not be appointed as external valuer of that AIF, unless it has functionally and hierarchically separated the performance of its depositary functions from its tasks as external valuer and the potential conflicts of interest are properly identified, managed, monitored and disclosed to the investors of the AIF.\n5.   Where an external valuer performs the valuation function, the AIFM shall demonstrate that:\n(a)\nthe external valuer is subject to mandatory professional registration recognised by law or to legal or regulatory provisions or rules of professional conduct;\n(b)\nthe external valuer can provide sufficient professional guarantees to be able to perform effectively the relevant valuation function in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3; and\n(c)\nthe appointment of the external valuer complies with the requirements of Article 20(1) and (2) and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 20(7).\n6.   The appointed external valuer shall not delegate the valuation function to a third party.\n7.   AIFMs shall notify the appointment of the external valuer to the competent authorities of their home Member State which may require that another external valuer be appointed instead, where the conditions laid down in paragraph 5 are not met.\n8.   The valuation shall be performed impartially and with all due skill, care and diligence.\n9.   Where the valuation function is not performed by an independent external valuer, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM may require the AIFM to have its valuation procedures and/or valuations verified by an external valuer or, where appropriate, by an auditor.\n10.   AIFMs are responsible for the proper valuation of AIF assets, the calculation of the net asset value and the publication of that net asset value. The AIFM’s liability towards the AIF and its investors shall, therefore, not be affected by the fact that the AIFM has appointed an external valuer.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph and irrespective of any contractual arrangements providing otherwise, the external valuer shall be liable to the AIFM for any losses suffered by the AIFM as a result of the external valuer’s negligence or intentional failure to perform its tasks.\n11.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying:\n(a)\nthe criteria concerning the procedures for the proper valuation of the assets and the calculation of the net asset value per unit or share;\n(b)\nthe professional guarantees the external valuer must be able to provide to effectively perform the valuation function;\n(c)\nthe frequency of valuation carried out by open-ended AIFs which is both appropriate to the assets held by the AIF and its issuance and redemption policy.\nSECTION 3\nDelegation of AIFM functions\nArticle 20\nDelegation\n1.   AIFMs which intend to delegate to third parties the task of carrying out functions on their behalf shall notify the competent authorities of their home Member State before the delegation arrangements become effective.

No delegation of portfolio management or risk management shall be conferred on:\n(a)\nthe depositary or a delegate of the depositary; or\n(b)\nany other entity whose interests may conflict with those of the AIFM or the investors of the AIF, unless such entity has functionally and hierarchically separated the performance of its portfolio management or risk management tasks from its other potentially conflicting tasks, and the potential conflicts of interest are properly identified, managed, monitored and disclosed to the investors of the AIF.\n3.   The AIFM’s liability towards the AIF and its investors shall not be affected by the fact that the AIFM has delegated functions to a third party, or by any further sub-delegation, nor shall the AIFM delegate its functions to the extent that, in essence, it can no longer be considered to be the manager of the AIF and to the extent that it becomes a letter-box entity.\n4.   The third party may sub-delegate any of the functions delegated to it provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe AIFM consented prior to the sub-delegation;\n(b)\nthe AIFM notified the competent authorities of its home Member State before the sub-delegation arrangements become effective;\n(c)\nthe conditions set out in paragraph 1, on the understanding that all references to the ‘delegate’ are read as references to the ‘sub-delegate’.\n5.   No sub-delegation of portfolio management or risk management shall be conferred on:\n(a)\nthe depositary or a delegate of the depositary; or\n(b)\nany other entity whose interests may conflict with those of the AIFM or the investors of the AIF, unless such entity has functionally and hierarchically separated the performance of its portfolio management or risk management tasks from its other potentially conflicting tasks, and the potential conflicts of interest are properly identified, managed, monitored and disclosed to the investors of the AIF.\nThe relevant delegate shall review the services provided by each sub-delegate on an ongoing basis.\n6.   Where the sub-delegate further delegates any of the functions delegated to it, the conditions set out in paragraph 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n7.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying:\n(a)\nthe conditions for fulfilling the requirements set out in paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5;\n(b)\nthe conditions under which the AIFM shall be deemed to have delegated its functions to the extent that it becomes a letter-box entity and can no longer be considered to be the manager of the AIF as set out in paragraph 3.\nSECTION 4\nDepositary\nArticle 21\nDepositary\n1.   For each AIF it manages, the AIFM shall ensure that a single depositary is appointed in accordance with this Article.\n2.   The appointment of the depositary shall be evidenced by written contract. The contract shall, inter alia, regulate the flow of information deemed necessary to allow the depositary to perform its functions for the AIF for which it has been appointed as depositary, as set out in this Directive and in other relevant laws, regulations or administrative provisions.\n3.   The depositary shall be:\n(a)\na credit institution having its registered office in the Union and authorised in accordance with Directive 2006/48/EC;\n(b)\nan investment firm having its registered office in the Union, subject to capital adequacy requirements in accordance with Article 20(1) of Directive 2006/49/EC including capital requirements for operational risks and authorised in accordance with Directive 2004/39/EC and which also provides the ancillary service of safe-keeping and administration of financial instruments for the account of clients in accordance with point (1) of Section B of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC; such investment firms shall in any case have own funds not less than the amount of initial capital referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2006/49/EC; or\n(c)\nanother category of institution that is subject to prudential regulation and ongoing supervision and which, on 21 July 2011, falls within the categories of institution determined by Member States to be eligible to be a depositary under Article 23(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC.\nFor non-EU AIFs only, and without prejudice to point (b) of paragraph 5, the depositary may also be a credit institution or any other entity of the same nature as the entities referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph provided that the conditions in point (b) of paragraph 6 are met.\nIn addition, Member States may allow that in relation to AIFs which have no redemption rights exercisable during the period of 5 years from the date of the initial investments and which, in accordance with their core investment policy, generally do not invest in assets that must be held in custody in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 8 or generally invest in issuers or non-listed companies in order to potentially acquire control over such companies in accordance with Article 26, the depositary may be an entity which carries out depositary functions as part of its professional or business activities in respect of which such entity is subject to mandatory professional registration recognised by law or to legal or regulatory provisions or rules of professional conduct and which can provide sufficient financial and professional guarantees to enable it to perform effectively the relevant depositary functions and meet the commitments inherent in those functions.\n4.   In order to avoid conflicts of interest between the depositary, the AIFM and/or the AIF and/or its investors:\n(a)\nan AIFM shall not act as depositary;\n(b)\na prime broker acting as counterparty to an AIF shall not act as depositary for that AIF, unless it has functionally and hierarchically separated the performance of its depositary functions from its tasks as prime broker and the potential conflicts of interest are properly identified, managed, monitored and disclosed to the investors of the AIF. Delegation by the depositary to such prime broker of its custody tasks in accordance with paragraph 11 is allowed if the relevant conditions are met.\n5.

Without prejudice to the requirements set out in paragraph 3, the appointment of a depositary established in a third country shall, at all times, be subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe competent authorities of the Member States in which the units or shares of the non-EU AIF are intended to be marketed, and, in so far as different, of the home Member State of the AIFM, have signed cooperation and exchange of information arrangements with the competent authorities of the depositary;\n(b)\nthe depositary is subject to effective prudential regulation, including minimum capital requirements, and supervision which have the same effect as Union law and are effectively enforced;\n(c)\nthe third country where the depositary is established is not listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by FATF;\n(d)\nthe Member States in which the units or shares of the non-EU AIF are intended to be marketed, and, in so far as different, the home Member State of the AIFM, have signed an agreement with the third country where the depositary is established which fully complies with the standards laid down in Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and ensures an effective exchange of information in tax matters including any multilateral tax agreements;\n(e)\nthe depositary shall by contract be liable to the AIF or to the investors of the AIF, consistently with paragraphs 12 and 13, and shall expressly agree to comply with paragraph 11.\nWhere a competent authority of another Member State disagrees with the assessment made on the application of points (a), (c) or (e) of the first subparagraph by the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\nOn the basis of the criteria referred to in point (b) of paragraph 17, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts, stating that prudential regulation and supervision of a third country have the same effect as Union law and are effectively enforced. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 59(2).\n7.   The depositary shall in general ensure that the AIF’s cash flows are properly monitored, and shall in particular ensure that all payments made by or on behalf of investors upon the subscription of units or shares of an AIF have been received and that all cash of the AIF has been booked in cash accounts opened in the name of the AIF or in the name of the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF or in the name of the depositary acting on behalf of the AIF at an entity referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 18(1) of Directive 2006/73/EC, or another entity of the same nature, in the relevant market where cash accounts are required provided that such entity is subject to effective prudential regulation and supervision which have the same effect as Union law and are effectively enforced and in accordance with the principles set out in Article 16 of Directive 2006/73/EC.\nWhere the cash accounts are opened in the name of the depositary acting on behalf of the AIF, no cash of the entity referred to in the first subparagraph and none of the depositary’s own cash shall be booked on such accounts.\n8.   The assets of the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF shall be entrusted to the depositary for safe-keeping, as follows:\n(a)\nfor financial instruments that can be held in custody:\n(i)\nthe depositary shall hold in custody all financial instruments that can be registered in a financial instruments account opened in the depositary’s books and all financial instruments that can be physically delivered to the depositary;\n(ii)\nfor that purpose, the depositary shall ensure that all those financial instruments that can be registered in a financial instruments account opened in the depositary’s books are registered in the depositary’s books within segregated accounts in accordance with the principles set out in Article 16 of Directive 2006/73/EC, opened in the name of the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF, so that they can be clearly identified as belonging to the AIF in accordance with the applicable law at all times;\n(b)\nfor other assets:\n(i)\nthe depositary shall verify the ownership of the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF of such assets and shall maintain a record of those assets for which it is satisfied that the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF holds the ownership of such assets;\n(ii)\nthe assessment whether the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF holds the ownership shall be based on information or documents provided by the AIF or the AIFM and, where available, on external evidence;\n(iii)\nthe depositary shall keep its record up-to-date.\n9.   In addition to the tasks referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8, the depositary shall:\n(a)\nensure that the sale, issue, re-purchase, redemption and cancellation of units or shares of the AIF are carried out in accordance with the applicable national law and the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation;\n(b)\nensure that the value of the units or shares of the AIF is calculated in accordance with the applicable national law, the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation and the procedures laid down in Article 19;\n(c)\ncarry out the instructions of the AIFM, unless they conflict with the applicable national law or the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation;\n(d)\nensure that in transactions involving the AIF’s assets any consideration is remitted to the AIF within the usual time limits;\n(e)\nensure that an AIF’s income is applied in accordance with the applicable national law and the AIF rules or instruments of incorporation.\n10.

The depositary shall not delegate to third parties its functions as described in this Article, save for those referred to in paragraph 8.\nThe depositary may delegate to third parties the functions referred to in paragraph 8 subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe tasks are not delegated with the intention of avoiding the requirements of this Directive;\n(b)\nthe depositary can demonstrate that there is an objective reason for the delegation;\n(c)\nthe depositary has exercised all due skill, care and diligence in the selection and the appointment of any third party to whom it wants to delegate parts of its tasks, and keeps exercising all due skill, care and diligence in the periodic review and ongoing monitoring of any third party to whom it has delegated parts of its tasks and of the arrangements of the third party in respect of the matters delegated to it; and\n(d)\nthe depositary ensures that the third party meets the following conditions at all times during the performance of the tasks delegated to it:\n(i)\nthe third party has the structures and the expertise that are adequate and proportionate to the nature and complexity of the assets of the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF which have been entrusted to it;\n(ii)\nfor custody tasks referred to in point (a) of paragraph 8, the third party is subject to effective prudential regulation, including minimum capital requirements, and supervision in the jurisdiction concerned and the third party is subject to an external periodic audit to ensure that the financial instruments are in its possession;\n(iii)\nthe third party segregates the assets of the depositary’s clients from its own assets and from the assets of the depositary in such a way that they can at any time be clearly identified as belonging to clients of a particular depositary;\n(iv)\nthe third party does not make use of the assets without the prior consent of the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF and prior notification to the depositary; and\n(v)\nthe third party complies with the general obligations and prohibitions set out in paragraphs 8 and 10.\nNotwithstanding point (d)(ii) of the second subparagraph, where the law of a third country requires that certain financial instruments be held in custody by a local entity and no local entities satisfy the delegation requirements laid down in that point, the depositary may delegate its functions to such a local entity only to the extent required by the law of the third country and only for as long as there are no local entities that satisfy the delegation requirements, subject to the following requirements:\n(a)\nthe investors of the relevant AIF must be duly informed that such delegation is required due to legal constraints in the law of the third country and of the circumstances justifying the delegation, prior to their investment; and\n(b)\nthe AIF, or the AIFM on behalf of the AIF, must instruct the depositary to delegate the custody of such financial instruments to such local entity.\nThe third party may, in turn, sub-delegate those functions, subject to the same requirements. In such a case, paragraph 13 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the relevant parties.\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, the provision of services as specified by Directive 98/26/EC by securities settlement systems as designated for the purposes of that Directive or the provision of similar services by third-country securities settlement systems shall not be considered a delegation of its custody functions.\n12.   The depositary shall be liable to the AIF or to the investors of the AIF, for the loss by the depositary or a third party to whom the custody of financial instruments held in custody in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 8 has been delegated.\nIn the case of such a loss of a financial instrument held in custody, the depositary shall return a financial instrument of identical type or the corresponding amount to the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF without undue delay. The depositary shall not be liable if it can prove that the loss has arisen as a result of an external event beyond its reasonable control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable efforts to the contrary.\nThe depositary shall also be liable to the AIF, or to the investors of the AIF, for all other losses suffered by them as a result of the depositary’s negligent or intentional failure to properly fulfil its obligations pursuant to this Directive.\n13.   The depositary’s liability shall not be affected by any delegation referred to in paragraph 11.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph of this paragraph, in case of a loss of financial instruments held in custody by a third party pursuant to paragraph 11, the depositary may discharge itself of liability if it can prove that:\n(a)\nall requirements for the delegation of its custody tasks set out in the second subparagraph of paragraph 11 are met;\n(b)\na written contract between the depositary and the third party expressly transfers the liability of the depositary to that third party and makes it possible for the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF to make a claim against the third party in respect of the loss of financial instruments or for the depositary to make such a claim on their behalf; and\n(c)\na written contract between the depositary and the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF, expressly allows a discharge of the depositary’s liability and establishes the objective reason to contract such a discharge.\n14.   Further, where the law of a third country requires that certain financial instruments are held in custody by a local entity and there are no local entities that satisfy the delegation requirements laid down in point (d)(ii) of paragraph 11, the depositary can discharge itself of liability provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe rules or instruments of incorporation of the AIF concerned expressly allow for such a discharge under the conditions set out in this paragraph;\n(b)\nthe investors of the relevant AIF have been duly informed of that discharge and of the circumstances justifying the discharge prior to their investment;\n(c)\nthe AIF or the AIFM on behalf of the AIF instructed the depositary to delegate the custody of such financial instruments to a local entity;\n(d)\nthere is a written contract between the depositary and the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF, which expressly allows such a discharge; and\n(e)\nthere is a written contract between the depositary and the third party that expressly transfers the liability of the depositary to that local entity and makes it possible for the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF to make a claim against that local entity in respect of the loss of financial instruments or for the depositary to make such a claim on their behalf.\n15.   Liability to the investors of the AIF may be invoked directly or indirectly through the AIFM, depending on the legal nature of the relationship between the depositary, the AIFM and the investors.\n16.   The depositary shall make available to its competent authorities, on request, all information which it has obtained while performing its duties and that may be necessary for the competent authorities of the AIF or the AIFM. If the competent authorities of the AIF or the AIFM are different from those of the depositary, the competent authorities of the depositary shall share the information received without delay with the competent authorities of the AIF and the AIFM.\n17.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying:\n(a)\nthe particulars that need to be included in the written contract referred to in paragraph 2;\n(b)\ngeneral criteria for assessing whether the prudential regulation and supervision of third countries as referred to in point (b) of paragraph 6 have the same effect as Union law and are effectively enforced;\n(c)\nthe conditions for performing the depositary functions pursuant to paragraphs 7, 8 and 9, including:\n(i)\nthe type of financial instruments to be included in the scope of the depositary’s custody duties in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 8;\n(ii)\nthe conditions subject to which the depositary is able to exercise its custody duties over financial instruments registered with a central depositary; and\n(iii)\nthe conditions subject to which the depositary is to safekeep the financial instruments issued in a nominative form and registered with an issuer or a registrar, in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 8;\n(d)\nthe due diligence duties of depositaries pursuant to point (c) of paragraph 11;\n(e)\nthe segregation obligation pursuant to point (d)(iii) of paragraph 11;\n(f)\nthe conditions subject to which and circumstances in which financial instruments held in custody are to be considered as lost;\n(g)\nwhat is to be understood by external events beyond reasonable control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable efforts to the contrary pursuant to paragraph 12;\n(h)\nthe conditions subject to which and circumstances in which there is an objective reason to contract a discharge pursuant to paragraph 13.\nCHAPTER IV\nTRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS\nArticle 22\nAnnual report\n1.

The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall ensure that all information gathered under Article 24 in respect of all AIFMs that they supervise and the information gathered under Article 7 is made available to competent authorities of other relevant Member States, ESMA and the ESRB by means of the procedures set out in Article 50 on supervisory cooperation.

The AIFM shall demonstrate that the leverage limits set by it for each AIF it manages are reasonable and that it complies with those limits at all times. The competent authorities shall assess the risks that the use of leverage by an AIFM with respect to the AIFs it manages could entail, and, where deemed necessary in order to ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, after having notified ESMA, the ESRB and the competent authorities of the relevant AIF, shall impose limits to the level of leverage that an AIFM are entitled to employ or other restrictions on the management of the AIF with respect to the AIFs under its management to limit the extent to which the use of leverage contributes to the build up of systemic risk in the financial system or risks of disorderly markets. The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall duly inform ESMA, the ESRB and the competent authorities of the AIF, of actions taken in this respect, through the procedures set out in Article 50.\n4.

In exceptional circumstances, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM may decide that the proposed measure takes effect within the period referred to in the first sentence.\n5.   ESMA shall perform a facilitation and coordination role, and, in particular, shall try to ensure that a consistent approach is taken by competent authorities, in relation to measures proposed by competent authorities under paragraph 3.\n6.   After receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 3, ESMA shall issue advice to the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM about the measure that is proposed or taken. The advice may, in particular, address whether the conditions for taking action appear to be met, whether the measures are appropriate and the duration of the measures.\n7.   On the basis of the information received in accordance with paragraph 2, and after taking into account any advice of the ESRB, ESMA may determine that the leverage employed by an AIFM, or by a group of AIFMs, poses a substantial risk to the stability and integrity of the financial system and may issue advice to competent authorities specifying the remedial measures to be taken, including limits to the level of leverage, which that AIFM, or that group of AIFMs, are entitled to employ. ESMA shall immediately inform the competent authorities concerned, the ESRB and the Commission of any such determination.\n8.   If a competent authority proposes to take action contrary to ESMA’s advice referred to in paragraph 6 or 7 it shall inform ESMA, stating its reasons. ESMA may publish the fact that a competent authority does not comply or intend to comply with its advice. ESMA may also decide, on a case-by-case basis, to publish the reasons provided by the competent authority for not complying with its advice. The competent authorities concerned shall receive advance notice about such a publication.\n9.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures setting out principles specifying the circumstances in which competent authorities apply the provisions set out in paragraph 3, taking into account different strategies of AIFs, different market conditions in which AIFs operate and possible pro-cyclical effects of applying those provisions.\nSECTION 2\nObligations for AIFMs managing AIFs which acquire control of non-listed companies and issuers\nArticle 26\nScope\n1.

ESMA may also decide, on a case-by-case basis, to publish the reasons provided by the competent authorities for not complying with that advice. The competent authorities shall receive advance notice about such a publication.\nIf the competent authorities propose to grant authorisation contrary to ESMA’s advice referred to in the third subparagraph and the AIFM intends to market units or shares of AIFs managed by it in Member States other than the Member State of reference, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform the competent authorities of those Member States thereof, stating their reasons. In so far as applicable, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform the competent authorities of the home Member States of the AIFs managed by the AIFM thereof, stating their reasons.\n6.

In case the competent authorities of the Member State of reference consider that the AIFM may rely on paragraph 2 to be exempted from compliance with certain provisions of this Directive, they shall, without undue delay, notify ESMA thereof. They shall support this assessment by the information provided by the AIFM in accordance with points (a)(ii) and (iii) of paragraph 8.\nWithin 1 month of receipt of the notification referred to in the first subparagraph, ESMA shall issue advice to the competent authorities about the application of the exemption for compliance with this Directive caused by the incompatibility in accordance with paragraph 2. The advice may, in particular, address whether the conditions for such exemption appear to be met based on the information provided by the AIFM in accordance with points (a)(ii) and (iii) of paragraph 8 and on the regulatory technical standards on equivalence. ESMA shall seek to build a common European supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices and ensure consistent approaches among competent authorities in relation to the application of this paragraph.\nThe term referred to in Article 8(5) shall be suspended during the ESMA review in accordance with this paragraph.\nIf the competent authorities of the Member State of reference propose to grant authorisation contrary to ESMA’s advice referred to in the second subparagraph they shall inform ESMA, stating their reasons.

ESMA shall keep a central register of those data, which shall be at the disposal of competent authorities, on request. Competent authorities shall treat this information as confidential.\n11.   The determination of the Member State of reference shall not be affected by the further business development of the AIFM in the Union. However, where the AIFM changes its marketing strategy within 2 years of its initial authorisation, and that change would have affected the determination of the Member State of reference if the modified marketing strategy had been the initial marketing strategy, the AIFM shall notify the competent authorities of the original Member State of reference of the change before implementing it and indicate its Member State of reference in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 4 and based on the new strategy.

In addition to the requirements in this Directive in relation to EU-AIFMs, for non-EU AIFMs the following conditions shall be met:\n(a)\nappropriate cooperation arrangements are in place between the competent authorities of the Member State of reference and the supervisory authority of the third country where the non-EU AIF is established in order to ensure at least an efficient exchange of information that allows the competent authorities to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive;\n(b)\nthe third country where the non-EU AIF is established is not listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by FATF;\n(c)\nthe third country where the non-EU AIF is established has signed an agreement with the Member State of reference and with each other Member State in which the units or shares of the non-EU AIF are intended to be marketed which fully complies with the standards laid down in Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and ensures an effective exchange of information in tax matters including any multilateral tax agreements.\nWhere a competent authority of another Member State disagrees with the assessment made on the application of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph by the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n3.   The AIFM shall submit a notification to the competent authorities of its Member State of reference in respect of each non-EU AIF that it intends to market in its Member State of reference.\nThat notification shall comprise the documentation and information set out in Annex III.\n4.   No later than 20 working days after receipt of a complete notification pursuant to paragraph 3, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall inform the AIFM whether it may start marketing the AIF identified in the notification referred to in paragraph 3 in its territory. The competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM may prevent the marketing of the AIF only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF does not or will not comply with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise does not or will not comply with this Directive. In the case of a positive decision, the AIFM may start marketing the AIF in its Member State of reference from the date of the notification by the competent authorities to that effect.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall also inform ESMA that the AIFM may start marketing units or shares of the AIF in the Member State of reference of the AIFM.\n5.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall, no later than 20 working days after the date of receipt of the complete notification file referred to in paragraph 5, transmit the complete notification file to the competent authorities of the Member States where the units or shares of the AIF are intended to be marketed. Such transmission shall occur only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF complies and will continue to comply with this Directive and that in general the AIFM complies with this Directive.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall enclose a statement to the effect that the AIFM concerned is authorised to manage AIFs with a particular investment strategy.\n7.   Upon transmission of the notification file, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall, without delay, notify the AIFM of the transmission. The AIFM may start marketing the AIF in the relevant host Member States of the AIFM as of the date of that notification.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall also inform ESMA that the AIFM may start marketing the units or shares of the AIF in the host Member States of the AIFM.\n8.

In the event of a material change to any of the particulars communicated in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5, the AIFM shall give written notice of that change to the competent authorities of the Member State of reference at least 1 month before implementing a planned change, or immediately after an unplanned change has occurred.\nIf, pursuant to a planned change, the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive, or the AIFM would otherwise no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall inform the AIFM, without undue delay, that it is not to implement the change.\nIf the planned change is implemented notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs, or if an unplanned change has taken place pursuant to which the AIFM’s management of the AIF no longer complies with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise no longer complies with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall take all due measures in accordance with Article 46, including, if necessary, the express prohibition of marketing of the AIF.\nIf the changes are acceptable because they do not affect the compliance of the AIFM’s management of the AIF with this Directive or the compliance by the AIFM with this Directive otherwise, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall, without delay, inform ESMA in so far as the changes concern the termination of the marketing of certain AIFs or additional AIFs being marketed and, in so far as applicable, the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM of those changes.\n11.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 in order to design a common framework to facilitate the establishment of those cooperation arrangements with third countries.\n12.   In order to ensure uniform application of this Article, ESMA may develop guidelines to determine the conditions of application of the measures adopted by the Commission regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2.\n13.

In case a competent authority rejects a request to exchange information in accordance with the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 14, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n16.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to determine:\n(a)\nthe form and content of a model for the notification letter referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5;\n(b)\nthe form and content of a model for the statement referred to in paragraph 6;\n(c)\nthe form of the transmission referred to in paragraph 6; and\n(d)\nthe form of the written notice referred to in paragraph 10.\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n17.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall, within 1 month of receiving the complete documentation in accordance with paragraph 2 or within 2 months of receiving the complete documentation in accordance with paragraph 3, transmit that documentation to the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM. Such transmission shall occur only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF complies and will continue to comply with this Directive and the AIFM otherwise complies with this Directive.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall enclose a statement to the effect that the AIFM concerned is authorised by them.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall immediately notify the AIFM about the transmission. Upon receipt of the transmission notification the AIFM may start to provide its services in the host Member States of the AIFM.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform ESMA that the AIFM may start managing the AIF in the host Member States of the AIFM.\n5.   The host Member States of the AIFM shall not impose any additional requirements on the AIFM concerned in respect of the matters covered by this Directive.\n6.   In the event of a change to any of the information communicated in accordance with paragraph 2 and, if relevant, paragraph 3, an AIFM shall give written notice of that change to the competent authorities of its Member State of reference at least 1 month before implementing a planned change, or immediately after an unplanned change has occurred.\nIf, pursuant to a planned change, the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM would otherwise no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall inform the AIFM without undue delay that it is not to implement the change.\nIf a planned change is implemented notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs or if an unplanned change has taken place pursuant to which the AIFM’s management of the AIF no longer complies with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise no longer complies with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall take all due measures in accordance with Article 46, including, if necessary, the express prohibition of marketing of the AIF.\nIf the changes are acceptable because they do not affect the compliance of the AIFM’s management of the AIF with this Directive or the compliance by the AIFM with this Directive otherwise, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall without undue delay inform the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM of those changes.\n7.   In order to ensure consistent harmonisation of this Article, ESMA may develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the information to be notified in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n8.

Without prejudice to Articles 37, 39 and 40, Member States may allow non-EU AIFMs to market to professional investors, in their territory only, units or shares of AIFs they manage subject at least to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe non-EU AIFM complies with Articles 22, 23 and 24 in respect of each AIF marketed by it pursuant to this Article and with Articles 26 to 30 where an AIF marketed by it pursuant to this Article falls within the scope of Article 26(1). Competent authorities and AIF investors referred to in those Articles shall be deemed those of the Member States where the AIFs are marketed;\n(b)\nappropriate cooperation arrangements for the purpose of systemic risk oversight and in line with international standards are in place between the competent authorities of the Member States where the AIFs are marketed, in so far as applicable, the competent authorities of the EU AIFs concerned and the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIFM is established and, in so far as applicable, the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIF is established in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information that allows competent authorities of the relevant Member States to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive;\n(c)\nthe third country where the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU AIF is established is not listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by FATF.\nWhere a competent authority of an EU AIF does not enter into the required cooperation arrangements as set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph within a reasonable period of time, the competent authorities of the Member State where the AIF is intended to be marketed may refer the matter to ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n2.   Member States may impose stricter rules on the non-EU AIFM in respect of the marketing of units or shares of AIFs to investors in their territory for the purpose of this Article.\n3.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 in order to design a common framework to facilitate the establishment of those cooperation arrangements with third countries.\n4.   In order to ensure uniform application of this Article, ESMA shall develop guidelines to determine the conditions of application of the measures adopted by the Commission regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in paragraph 1.\nCHAPTER VIII\nMARKETING TO RETAIL INVESTORS\nArticle 43\nMarketing of AIFs by AIFMs to retail investors\n1.   Without prejudice to other instruments of Union law, Member States may allow AIFMs to market to retail investors in their territory units or shares of AIFs they manage in accordance with this Directive, irrespective of whether such AIFs are marketed on a domestic or cross-border basis or whether they are EU or non-EU AIFs.\nIn such cases, Member States may impose stricter requirements on the AIFM or the AIF than the requirements applicable to the AIFs marketed to professional investors in their territory in accordance with this Directive. However, Member States shall not impose stricter or additional requirements on EU AIFs established in another Member State and marketed on a cross-border basis than on AIFs marketed domestically.\n2.   Member States that permit the marketing of AIFs to retail investors in their territory shall, by 22 July 2014, inform the Commission and ESMA of:\n(a)\nthe types of AIF which AIFMs may market to retail investors in their territory;\n(b)\nany additional requirements that the Member State imposes for the marketing of AIFs to retail investors.\nMember States shall also inform the Commission and ESMA of any subsequent changes with regard to the first subparagraph.\nCHAPTER IX\nCOMPETENT AUTHORITIES\nSECTION 1\nDesignation, powers and redress procedures\nArticle 44\nDesignation of competent authorities\nMember States shall designate the competent authorities which are to carry out the duties provided for in this Directive.\nThey shall inform ESMA and the Commission thereof, indicating any division of duties.\nThe competent authorities shall be public authorities.\nMember States shall require that their competent authorities establish the appropriate methods to monitor that AIFMs comply with their obligations under this Directive, where relevant on the basis of guidelines developed by ESMA.\nArticle 45\nResponsibility of competent authorities in Member States\n1.   The prudential supervision of an AIFM shall be the responsibility of the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, whether the AIFM manages and/or markets AIFs in another Member State or not, without prejudice to those provisions of this Directive which confer the responsibility for supervision on the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM.\n2.   The supervision of an AIFM’s compliance with Articles 12 and 14 shall be the responsibility of the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM where the AIFM manages and/or markets AIFs through a branch in that Member State.\n3.   The competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM may require an AIFM managing or marketing AIFs in its territory, whether or not through a branch, to provide the information necessary for the supervision of the AIFM’s compliance with the applicable rules for which those competent authorities are responsible.\nThose requirements shall not be more stringent than those which the host Member State of the AIFM imposes on AIFMs for which it is the home Member State for the monitoring of their compliance with the same rules.\n4.   Where the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM ascertain that an AIFM managing and/or marketing AIFs in its territory, whether or not through a branch, is in breach of one of the rules in relation to which they have responsibility for supervising compliance, those authorities shall require the AIFM concerned to put an end to that breach and inform the competent authorities of the home Member State thereof.\n5.   If the AIFM concerned refuses to provide the competent authorities of its host Member State with information falling under their responsibility, or fails to take the necessary steps to put an end to the breach referred to in paragraph 4, the competent authorities of its host Member State shall inform the competent authorities of its home Member State thereof. The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, at the earliest opportunity:\n(a)\ntake all appropriate measures to ensure that the AIFM concerned provides the information requested by the competent authorities of its host Member State pursuant to paragraph 3, or puts an end to the breach referred to in paragraph 4;\n(b)\nrequest the necessary information from the relevant supervisory authorities in third countries.\nThe nature of the measures referred to in point (a) shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM.\n6.   If, despite the measures taken by the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM pursuant to paragraph 5 or because such measures prove to be inadequate or are not available in the Member State in question, the AIFM continues to refuse to provide the information requested by the competent authorities of its host Member State pursuant to paragraph 3, or persists in breaching the legal or regulatory provisions, referred to in paragraph 4, in force in its host Member State, the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM may, after informing the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, take appropriate measures, including those laid down in Articles 46 and 48, to prevent or penalise further irregularities and, in so far as necessary, to prevent that AIFM from initiating any further transactions in its host Member State. Where the function carried out in the host Member State of the AIFM is the management of AIFs, the host Member State may require the AIFM to cease managing those AIFs.\n7.   Where the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM have clear and demonstrable grounds for believing that the AIFM is in breach of the obligations arising from rules in relation to which they have no responsibility for supervising compliance, they shall refer those findings to the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM which shall take appropriate measures, including, if necessary, request additional information from the relevant supervisory authorities in third countries.\n8.   If despite the measures taken by the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM or because such measures prove to be inadequate, or because the home Member State of the AIFM fails to act within a reasonable timeframe, the AIFM persists in acting in a manner that is clearly prejudicial to the interests of the investors of the relevant AIF, the financial stability or the integrity of the market in the host Member State of the AIFM, the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM may, after informing the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, take all appropriate measures needed in order to protect the investors of the relevant AIF, the financial stability and the integrity of the market in the host Member State, including the possibility of preventing the AIFM concerned to further market the units or shares of the relevant AIF in the host Member State.\n9.   The procedure laid down in paragraphs 7 and 8 shall also apply in the event that the competent authorities of the host Member State have clear and demonstrable grounds for disagreement with the authorisation of a non-EU AIFM by the Member State of reference.\n10.   Where the competent authorities concerned disagree on any of the measures taken by a competent authority pursuant to paragraphs 4 to 9, they may bring the matter to the attention of ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred to it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n11.   Where applicable, ESMA shall facilitate the negotiation and conclusion of the cooperation arrangements required by this Directive between the competent authorities of the Member States and the supervisory authorities of third countries.\nArticle 46\nPowers of competent authorities\n1.   Competent authorities shall be given all supervisory and investigatory powers that are necessary for the exercise of their functions. Such powers shall be exercised in any of the following ways:\n(a)\ndirectly;\n(b)\nin collaboration with other authorities;\n(c)\nunder their responsibility by delegation to entities to which tasks have been delegated;\n(d)\nby application to the competent judicial authorities.\n2.   The competent authorities shall have the power to:\n(a)\nhave access to any document in any form and to receive a copy of it;\n(b)\nrequire information from any person related to the activities of the AIFM or the AIF and if necessary to summon and question a person with a view to obtaining information;\n(c)\ncarry out on-site inspections with or without prior announcements;\n(d)\nrequire existing telephone and existing data traffic records;\n(e)\nrequire the cessation of any practice that is contrary to the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive;\n(f)\nrequest the freezing or the sequestration of assets;\n(g)\nrequest the temporary prohibition of professional activity;\n(h)\nrequire authorised AIFM, depositaries or auditors to provide information;\n(i)\nadopt any type of measure to ensure that AIFMs or depositaries continue to comply with the requirements of this Directive applicable to them;\n(j)\nrequire the suspension of the issue, repurchase or redemption of units in the interest of the unit-holders or of the public;\n(k)\nwithdraw the authorisation granted to an AIFM or a depositary;\n(l)\nrefer matters for criminal prosecution;\n(m)\nrequest that auditors or experts carry out verifications or investigations.\n3.   Where the competent authority of the Member State of reference considers that an authorised non-EU AIFM is in breach of its obligations under this Directive, it shall notify ESMA, setting out full reasons as soon as possible.\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have the powers necessary to take all measures required in order to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in those cases where the activity of one or more AIFs in the market for a financial instrument could jeopardise the orderly functioning of that market.\nArticle 47\nPowers and competences of ESMA\n1.   ESMA may develop and regularly review guidelines for the competent authorities of the Member States on the exercise of their authorisation powers and on the reporting obligations by the competent authorities imposed by this Directive.\nESMA shall further have the powers necessary, including those enumerated in Article 48(3), to carry out the tasks attributed to it by this Directive.\n2.   The obligation of professional secrecy shall apply to all persons who work or who have worked for ESMA, and for the competent authorities or for any other person to whom ESMA has delegated tasks, including auditors and experts contracted by ESMA. Information covered by professional secrecy shall not be disclosed to another person or authority except where such disclosure is necessary for legal proceedings.\n3.   All the information exchanged under this Directive between ESMA, the competent authorities, EBA, the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (29) and the ESRB shall be considered confidential, except where ESMA or the competent authority or other authority or body concerned states at the time of communication that such information may be disclosed or where such disclosure is necessary for legal proceedings.\n4.   In accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, ESMA may, where all the conditions in paragraph 5 are met, request the competent authority or competent authorities to take any of the following measures, as appropriate:\n(a)\nprohibit the marketing in the Union of units or shares of AIFs managed by non-EU AIFMs or of non-EU AIFs managed by EU AIFMs without the authorisation required in Article 37 or without the notification required in Articles 35, 39 and 40 or without being allowed to do so by the relevant Member States in accordance with Article 42;\n(b)\nimpose restrictions on non-EU AIFMs relating to the management of an AIF in case of excessive concentration of risk in a specific market on a cross-border basis;\n(c)\nimpose restrictions on non-EU AIFMs relating to the management of an AIF where its activities potentially constitute an important source of counterparty risk to a credit institution or other systemically relevant institutions.\n5.   ESMA may take a decision under paragraph 4 and subject to the requirements set out in paragraph 6 if both of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\na substantial threat exists, originating or aggravated by the activities of AIFMs, to the orderly functioning and integrity of the financial market or to the stability of the whole or a part of the financial system in the Union and there are cross border implications; and\n(b)\nthe relevant competent authority or competent authorities have not taken measures to address the threat or the measures that have been taken do not sufficiently address the threat.\n6.   The measures taken by the competent authority or competent authorities pursuant to paragraph 4 shall:\n(a)\neffectively address the threat to the orderly functioning and the integrity of the financial market or to the stability of the whole or a part of the financial system in the Union or significantly improve the ability of competent authorities to monitor the threat;\n(b)\nnot create a risk of regulatory arbitrage;\n(c)\nnot have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the financial markets, including reducing liquidity in those markets or creating uncertainty for market participants, in a way that is disproportionate to the benefits of the measures.\n7.   Before requesting the competent authority to take or renew any measure referred to in paragraph 4, ESMA shall consult, where appropriate, the ESRB and other relevant authorities.\n8.   ESMA shall notify the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the non-EU AIFM and the competent authorities of the host Member States of the non-EU AIFM concerned of the decision to request the competent authority or competent authorities to impose or renew any measure referred to in paragraph 4. The notification shall at least specify the following details:\n(a)\nthe AIFM and the activities to which the measures apply and their duration;\n(b)\nthe reasons why ESMA is of the opinion that it is necessary to impose the measures in accordance with the conditions and requirements set out in this Article, including the evidence in support of those reasons.\n9.   ESMA shall review its measures referred to in paragraph 4 at appropriate intervals and in any event at least every 3 months. If a measure is not renewed after that 3-month period, it shall automatically expire. Paragraphs 5 to 8 shall apply to a renewal of measures.\n10.   The competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the non-EU AIFM concerned may request ESMA to reconsider its decision. The procedure set out in the second subparagraph of Article 44(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 shall apply.\nArticle 48\nAdministrative penalties\n1.   Member States shall lay down the rules on measures and penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that those rules are enforced. Without prejudice to the procedures for the withdrawal of authorisation or to the right of Member States to impose criminal penalties, Member States shall ensure, in accordance with their national law, that the appropriate administrative measures can be taken or administrative penalties be imposed against the persons responsible where the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive have not been complied with. Member States shall ensure that those measures are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n2.   Member States shall provide that the competent authorities may disclose to the public any measure or penalty that will be imposed for infringement of the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive, unless such disclosure would seriously jeopardise the financial markets, be detrimental to the interests of the investors or cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved.\n3.   ESMA shall draw up an annual report on the application of administrative measures and imposition of penalties in the case of breaches of the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive in the different Member States. Competent authorities shall provide ESMA with the necessary information for that purpose.\nArticle 49\nRight of appeal\n1.   The competent authorities shall give written reasons for any decision to refuse or withdraw authorisation of AIFMs to manage and/or market AIFs, or any negative decision taken in the implementation of the measures adopted in application of this Directive, and communicate them to applicants.\n2.   Member States shall provide that any decision taken under laws, regulations or administrative provisions adopted in accordance with this Directive is properly reasoned and is the subject of the right of appeal to the courts.\nThat right to appeal to the courts shall apply also where, in respect of an application for authorisation which provides all the information required, no decision is taken within 6 months of the submission of the application.\nSECTION 2\nCooperation between different competent authorities\nArticle 50\nObligation to cooperate\n1.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall cooperate with each other and with ESMA and the ESRB whenever necessary for the purpose of carrying out their duties under this Directive or of exercising their powers under this Directive or under national law.\n2.   Member States shall facilitate the cooperation provided for in this Section.\n3.   Competent authorities shall use their powers for the purpose of cooperation, even in cases where the conduct under investigation does not constitute an infringement of any regulation in force in their own Member State.\n4.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall immediately supply one another and ESMA with the information required for the purposes of carrying out their duties under this Directive.\nThe competent authorities of the home Member State shall forward a copy of the relevant cooperation arrangements entered into by them in accordance with Article 35, 37 and/or 40 to the host Member States of the AIFM concerned. The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, in accordance with procedures relating to the applicable regulatory technical standards referred to in Article 35(14), Article 37(17) or Article 40(14), forward the information received from third-country supervisory authorities in accordance with cooperation arrangements with such supervisory authorities in respect of an AIFM, or, where relevant, pursuant to Article 45(6) or (7), to the competent authorities of host Member State of the AIFM concerned.\nWhere a competent authority of a host Member State considers that the contents of the cooperation arrangement entered into by the home Member State of the AIFM concerned in accordance with Article 35, 37 and/or 40 does not comply with what is required pursuant to the applicable regulatory technical standards, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n5.   Where the competent authorities of one Member State have clear and demonstrable grounds to suspect that acts contrary to this Directive are being or have been carried out by an AIFM not subject to supervision of those competent authorities, they shall notify ESMA and the competent authorities of the home and host Member States of the AIFM concerned thereof in as specific a manner as possible.

After finalising its review, the Commission shall, without undue delay, submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council.

I\n1.\nInvestment management functions which an AIFM shall at least perform when managing an AIF:\n(a)\nportfolio management;\n(b)\nrisk management.\n2.\nOther functions that an AIFM may additionally perform in the course of the collective management of an AIF:\n(a)\nAdministration:\n(i)\nlegal and fund management accounting services;\n(ii)\ncustomer inquiries;\n(iii)\nvaluation and pricing, including tax returns;\n(iv)\nregulatory compliance monitoring;\n(v)\nmaintenance of unit-/shareholder register;\n(vi)\ndistribution of income;\n(vii)\nunit/shares issues and redemptions;\n(viii)\ncontract settlements, including certificate dispatch;\n(ix)\nrecord keeping;\n(b)\nMarketing;\n(c)\nActivities related to the assets of AIFs, namely services necessary to meet the fiduciary duties of the AIFM, facilities management, real estate administration activities, advice to undertakings on capital structure, industrial strategy and related matters, advice and services relating to mergers and the purchase of undertakings and other services connected to the management of the AIF and the companies and other assets in which it has invested.\nANNEX II\nREMUNERATION POLICY\n1.\nWhen establishing and applying the total remuneration policies, inclusive of salaries and discretionary pension benefits, for those categories of staff, including senior management, risk takers, control functions and any employee receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers, whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profiles of the AIFMs or of AIFs they manage, AIFMs shall comply with the following principles in a way and to the extent that is appropriate to their size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities:\n(a)\nthe remuneration policy is consistent with and promotes sound and effective risk management and does not encourage risk-taking which is inconsistent with the risk profiles, rules or instruments of incorporation of the AIFs they manage;\n(b)\nthe remuneration policy is in line with the business strategy, objectives, values and interests of the AIFM and the AIFs it manages or the investors of such AIFs, and includes measures to avoid conflicts of interest;\n(c)\nthe management body of the AIFM, in its supervisory function, adopts and periodically reviews the general principles of the remuneration policy and is responsible for its implementation;\n(d)\nthe implementation of the remuneration policy is, at least annually, subject to central and independent internal review for compliance with policies and procedures for remuneration adopted by the management body in its supervisory function;\n(e)\nstaff engaged in control functions are compensated in accordance with the achievement of the objectives linked to their functions, independent of the performance of the business areas they control;\n(f)\nthe remuneration of the senior officers in the risk management and compliance functions is directly overseen by the remuneration committee;\n(g)\nwhere remuneration is performance related, the total amount of remuneration is based on a combination of the assessment of the performance of the individual and of the business unit or AIF concerned and of the overall results of the AIFM, and when assessing individual performance, financial as well as non-financial criteria are taken into account;\n(h)\nthe assessment of performance is set in a multi-year framework appropriate to the life-cycle of the AIFs managed by the AIFM in order to ensure that the assessment process is based on longer term performance and that the actual payment of performance-based components of remuneration is spread over a period which takes account of the redemption policy of the AIFs it manages and their investment risks;\n(i)\nguaranteed variable remuneration is exceptional, occurs only in the context of hiring new staff and is limited to the first year;\n(j)\nfixed and variable components of total remuneration are appropriately balanced and the fixed component represents a sufficiently high proportion of the total remuneration to allow the operation of a fully flexible policy, on variable remuneration components, including the possibility to pay no variable remuneration component;\n(k)\npayments related to the early termination of a contract reflect performance achieved over time and are designed in a way that does not reward failure;\n(l)\nthe measurement of performance used to calculate variable remuneration components or pools of variable remuneration components includes a comprehensive adjustment mechanism to integrate all relevant types of current and future risks;\n(m)\nsubject to the legal structure of the AIF and its rules or instruments of incorporation, a substantial portion, and in any event at least 50 % of any variable remuneration consists of units or shares of the AIF concerned, or equivalent ownership interests, or share-linked instruments or equivalent non-cash instruments, unless the management of AIFs accounts for less than 50 % of the total portfolio managed by the AIFM, in which case the minimum of 50 % does not apply.\nThe instruments referred to in this point shall be subject to an appropriate retention policy designed to align incentives with the interests of the AIFM and the AIFs it manages and the investors of such AIFs. Member States or their competent authorities may place restrictions on the types and designs of those instruments or ban certain instruments as appropriate. This point shall be applied to both the portion of the variable remuneration component deferred in line with point (n) and the portion of the variable remuneration component not deferred;\n(n)\na substantial portion, and in any event at least 40 %, of the variable remuneration component, is deferred over a period which is appropriate in view of the life cycle and redemption policy of the AIF concerned and is correctly aligned with the nature of the risks of the AIF in question.\nThe period referred to in this point shall be at least three to 5 years unless the life cycle of the AIF concerned is shorter; remuneration payable under deferral arrangements vests no faster than on a pro-rata basis; in the case of a variable remuneration component of a particularly high amount, at least 60 % of the amount is deferred;\n(o)\nthe variable remuneration, including the deferred portion, is paid or vests only if it is sustainable according to the financial situation of the AIFM as a whole, and justified according to the performance of the business unit, the AIF and the individual concerned.\nThe total variable remuneration shall generally be considerably contracted where subdued or negative financial performance of the AIFM or of the AIF concerned occurs, taking into account both current compensation and reductions in payouts of amounts previously earned, including through malus or clawback arrangements;\n(p)\nthe pension policy is in line with the business strategy, objectives, values and long-term interests of the AIFM and the AIFs it manages.\nIf the employee leaves the AIFM before retirement, discretionary pension benefits shall be held by the AIFM for a period of 5 years in the form of instruments defined in point (m). In the case of an employee reaching retirement, discretionary pension benefits shall be paid to the employee in the form of instruments defined in point (m), subject to a 5 year retention period;\n(q)\nstaff are required to undertake not to use personal hedging strategies or remuneration- and liability-related insurance to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in their remuneration arrangements;\n(r)\nvariable remuneration is not paid through vehicles or methods that facilitate the avoidance of the requirements of this Directive.\n2.\nThe principles set out in paragraph 1 shall apply to remuneration of any type paid by the AIFM, to any amount paid directly by the AIF itself, including carried interest, and to any transfer of units or shares of the AIF, made to the benefits of those categories of staff, including senior management, risk takers, control functions and any employee receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers, whose professional activities have a material impact on their risk profile or the risk profiles of the AIF that they manage.\n3.\nAIFMs that are significant in terms of their size or the size of the AIFs they manage, their internal organisation and the nature, the scope and the complexity of their activities shall establish a remuneration committee. The remuneration committee shall be constituted in a way that enables it to exercise competent and independent judgment on remuneration policies and practices and the incentives created for managing risk.\nThe remuneration committee shall be responsible for the preparation of decisions regarding remuneration, including those which have implications for the risk and risk management of the AIFM or the AIF concerned and which are to be taken by the management body in its supervisory function. The remuneration committee shall be chaired by a member of the management body who does not perform any executive functions in the AIFM concerned. The members of the remuneration committee shall be members of the management body who do not perform any executive functions in the AIFM concerned.\nANNEX III\nDOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED IN CASE OF INTENDED MARKETING IN THE HOME MEMBER STATE OF THE AIFM\n(a)\nA notification letter, including a programme of operations identifying the AIFs the AIFM intends to market and information on where the AIFs are established;\n(b)\nthe AIF rules or instruments of incorporation;\n(c)\nidentification of the depositary of the AIF;\n(d)\na description of, or any information on, the AIF available to investors;\n(e)\ninformation on where the master AIF is established if the AIF is a feeder AIF;\n(f)\nany additional information referred to in Article 23(1) for each AIF the AIFM intends to market;\n(g)\nwhere relevant, information on the arrangements established to prevent units or shares of the AIF from being marketed to retail investors, including in the case where the AIFM relies on activities of independent entities to provide investment services in respect of the AIF.\nANNEX IV\nDOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED IN THE CASE OF INTENDED MARKETING IN MEMBER STATES OTHER THAN THE HOME MEMBER STATE OF THE AIFM\n(a)\nA notification letter, including a programme of operations identifying the AIFs the AIFM intends to market and information on where the AIFs are established;\n(b)\nthe AIF rules or instruments of incorporation;\n(c)\nidentification of the depositary of the AIF;\n(d)\na description of, or any information on, the AIF available to investors;\n(e)\ninformation on where the master AIF is established if the AIF is a feeder AIF;\n(f)\nany additional information referred to in Article 23(1) for each AIF the AIFM intends to market;\n(g)\nthe indication of the Member State in which it intends to market the units or shares of the AIF to professional investors;\n(h)\ninformation about arrangements made for the marketing of AIFs and, where relevant, information on the arrangements established to prevent units or shares of the AIF from being marketed to retail investors, including in the case where the AIFM relies on activities of independent entities to provide investment services in respect of the AIF.", "summary": "Hedge funds and private equity funds — rules for managers\nHedge funds and private equity funds — rules for managers\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2011/61/EU on alternative investment fund managers\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt lays down the rules for authorising, supervising and overseeing managers of a range of alternative investment funds (AIFs), including hedge funds and private equity in the European Union (EU).\nThe directive has been amended several times and the European Commission has adopted a number of delegated and implementing acts which supplement the directive or offer technical guidance on its application.\nKEY POINTS\nExclusions from scope\nThe directive does not apply to the following:\nholding companies (as defined in the directive);\nmanagement of pension funds;\nemployee participation or savings schemes;\nsupranational institutions;\nnational central banks; and\ninsurance contracts.\nPassporting\nAlternative investment fund managers (AIFMs) can ‘passport’ their services in different EU Member States on the basis of a single authorisation. This means that once an AIFM is authorised in one Member State and complies with the rules of the directive, it is entitled to manage or market funds to professional investors throughout the EU.\nAuthorisations\nTo operate in the EU, fund managers must obtain authorisation from the competent authority of their home Member State. To obtain authorisation, AIFMs have to hold a minimum level of capital in the form of liquid or short-term assets.\nDepositary\nAIFMs are required to ensure that the funds they manage appoint an independent depositary. This could be, for example, a bank or investment firm that is responsible for overseeing the fund’s activities and ensuring that its assets are appropriately protected.\nRisk management and prudential oversight\nAIFMs must be able to assure the competent authority of the robustness of their internal arrangements with respect to risk management.\nThis includes a requirement to disclose, on a regular basis, the main markets and instruments in which they trade, their principal exposures and their risk concentrations.\nTreatment of investors\nTo encourage diligence amongst their investors, AIFMs are required to provide a clear description of their investment policy, including of the types of assets and the use of leverage. An annual report for each financial year has to be made available to investors on request.\nLeveraged funds\nThe directive sets out specific requirements with regard to leverage, i.e. the use of debt to finance investment. Competent authorities may set leverage limits in order to ensure the stability of the financial system.\nPrivate equity funds\nWhere an AIF acquires control of a non-listed company or an issuer, the AIFM is subject to anti-asset stripping rules. For a period of 2 years, the AIFM must act against any distribution, capital reduction, share redemption or acquisition of own shares by the company.\nFunds and managers located in non-EU countries\nSubject to conditions set out in the directive, the ‘passport’ may be extended to non-EU AIFMs and to the marketing of non-EU funds, managed by either EU or non-EU AIFMs.\nRole of the European Securities and Markets Authority\nThe European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) plays an active role in building a common supervisory culture in particular by issuing guidelines on sound remuneration policies and developing technical standards to determine types of AIFMs.\nSmaller funds\nMember States may choose not to apply the directive to smaller AIFMs, i.e. funds with managed assets below €100 million if they use leverage, and with assets below €500 million if they do not. Smaller funds are however subject to minimum registration and reporting requirements.\nAmendments to Directive (EU) 2011/61\nDirective (EU) 2016/2341 concerning institutions for occupational pension funds (IORPs) (see summary), introduces the following two additional rules.\nMember States must not:\nrestrict IORPs from appointing, for the management of the investment portfolio, investment managers established in another Member State and duly authorised for this activity;\nrestrict IORPs accepted as a depositary for the purposes of Directive 2011/61/EU.\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2402, which sets up a general framework for securitisation (see summary), introduces a rule requiring that where AIFMs are exposed to a securitisation that no longer meets the requirements it lays down, they must, in the best interest of the investors in the relevant AIFs, act and take corrective action, if appropriate.\nDirective (EU) 2019/1160 includes several changes.\nIt introduces the concept of — and the conditions for — pre-marketing* by an AIF manager established in the EU; any rules introduced by Member States must under no circumstances disadvantage EU AIFMs vis-à-vis non-EU AIFMs.\nIt addresses the conditions which apply where an EU AIF discontinues the marketing of units or shares in Member States other than in the home Member State of the AIFM and its notification requirements. All transparency requirements that investors must fulfil under Directive 2011/61/EU would continue to apply to investors who would retain their investment after de-notification of the marketing activities in the selected Member State.\nAmendments introduced by Directive (EU) 2019/2034 ensure that the own funds of the AIFM must amount to at least one quarter of the fixed overheads of the preceding year. Investment firms must use figures resulting from the applicable accounting framework.\nDelegated and implementing acts\nThe Commission has adopted several delegated and implementing acts.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 231/2013 supplements Directive 2011/61/EU with regard to exemptions, general operating conditions, depositaries, leverage, transparency and supervision. This delegated regulation has, in turn, been amended by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1618 on safe-keeping duties of depositaries and by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1255 on sustainability risks and sustainability factors to be taken into account by AIFMs.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 694/2014 supplements Directive 2011/61/EU with regard to regulatory technical standards determining types of alternative investment fund managers.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2015/514 sets out the information to be provided by competent authorities to the ESMA.\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 447/2013 sets out the procedure for AIFMs which choose to opt in and request authorisation under Directive 2011/61/EU.\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 448/2013 sets out a procedure for determining the Member State of reference of a non-EU AIFM.\nAmendment of other legislation\nDirective 2011/61/EU also amended Directives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 21 July 2011 and had to become law in the Member States by 22 July 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nInvestment funds (European Commission)\nAlternative investment fund managers (AIFM) — Directive 2011/61/EU (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPre-marketing.
