For the implementation of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, the following provisions shall apply:\n(a)\nthe problems arising from the situation referred to in this Article shall be immediately referred for examination to the Stabilisation and Association Council, which may take any decisions needed to put an end to such problems.\nIf the Stabilisation and Association Council or the exporting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the problems, or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Stabilisation and Association Council, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem in accordance with this Article. In the selection of safeguard measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement. Safeguard measures applied in accordance with Article XIX GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards shall preserve the level/margin of preference granted under this Agreement.\n(b)\nwhere exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in this Article, apply forth with provisional measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.\nThe safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.\n6.   In the event of the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the problems referred to in this Article to an administrative procedure having as its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party.\nArticle 40\nShortage clause\n1.   Where compliance with the provisions of this Title leads to:\n(a)\na critical shortage, or threat thereof, of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting Party; or\n(b)\nre-export to a third country of a product against which the exporting Party maintains quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect, and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party\nthat Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article.\n2.   In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement. Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.\n3.   Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 applies the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the case may be, shall supply the Stabilisation and Association Council with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. The Parties within the Stabilisation and Association Council may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Stabilisation and Association Council, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article on the exportation of the product concerned.\n4.   Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina, whichever is concerned, may apply forthwith the precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.\n5.   Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately notified to the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their elimination as soon as circumstances permit.\nArticle 41\nState monopolies\nBosnia and Herzegovina shall adjust any state monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that, following the entry into force of this Agreement, no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States and of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nArticle 42\nRules of origin\nExcept if otherwise stipulated in this Agreement, Protocol 2 lays down the rules of origin for the application of the provisions of this Agreement.\nArticle 43\nRestrictions authorised\nThis Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value or the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold and silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.\nArticle 44\nFailure to provide administrative cooperation\n1.   The Parties agree that administrative cooperation is essential for the implementation and the control of the preferential treatment granted under this Title and underline their commitment to combat irregularities and fraud in customs and related matters.\n2.   Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud under this Title, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in accordance with this Article.\n3.   For the purpose of this Article a failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia:\n(a)\na repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned;\n(b)\na repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of subsequent verification of the proof of origin;\n(c)\na repeated refusal or undue delay in obtaining authorisation to conduct administrative cooperation missions to verify the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in question.\nFor the purpose of this Article a finding of irregularities or fraud may be made, inter alia, where there is a rapid increase, without satisfactory explanation, in imports of goods exceeding the usual level of production and export capacity of the other Party, that is linked to objective information concerning irregularities or fraud.\n4.   The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe Party which has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud shall without undue delay notify the Stabilisation and Association Committee of its finding together with the objective information and enter into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee, on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties;\n(b)\nwhere the Parties have entered into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee as above and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned. A temporary suspension shall be notified to the Stabilisation and Association Committee without undue delay;\n(c)\ntemporary suspensions under this Article shall be limited to the minimum necessary to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed. Temporary suspensions shall be notified immediately after their adoption to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application no longer prevail.\n5.   At the same time as the notification to the Stabilisation and Association Committee under paragraph 4(a) of this Article, the Party concerned should publish a notice to importers in its Official Journal. The notice to importers should indicate for the product concerned that there is a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud.\nArticle 45\nFinancial responsibility\nIn case of error by the competent authorities in the proper management of the preferential system at export, and in particular in the application of the provisions of Protocol 2, where this error leads to consequences in terms of import duties, the Party facing such consequences may request the Stabilisation and Association Council to examine the possibilities of adopting all appropriate measures with a view to resolving the situation.\nArticle 46\nThe application of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands.\nTITLE V\nMOVEMENT OF WORKERS, ESTABLISHMENT, SUPPLY OF SERVICES, MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL\nCHAPTER I\nMovement of workers\nArticle 47\n1.   Subject to the conditions and modalities applicable in each Member State:\n(a)\ntreatment accorded to workers who are nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina and who are legally employed in the territory of a Member State shall be free of any discrimination based on nationality, as regards working conditions, remuneration or dismissal, compared to nationals of that Member State;\n(b)\nthe legally resident spouse and children of a worker legally employed in the territory of a Member State, with the exception of seasonal workers and of workers covered by bilateral agreements within the meaning of Article 48, unless otherwise provided by such agreements, shall have access to the labour market of that Member State, during the period of that worker's authorised stay of employment.\n2.   Bosnia and Herzegovina shall, subject to the conditions and modalities applicable in that country, accord the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 to workers who are nationals of a Member State and are legally employed in its territory as well as to their spouse and children who are legally resident in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nArticle 48\n1.   Taking into account the situation in the labour market in the Member States, and subject to their legislation and to compliance with the rules in force in the Member States in the area of mobility of workers:\n(a)\nthe existing facilities of access to employment for workers of Bosnia and Herzegovina accorded by Member States under bilateral agreements should be preserved and if possible improved;\n(b)\nthe other Member States shall examine the possibility of concluding similar agreements.\n2.   After three years, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine the granting of other improvements, including facilities for access to professional training, in accordance with the rules and procedures in force in the Member States, and taking into account the situation in the labour market in the Member States and in the Community.\nArticle 49\n1.   Rules shall be laid down for the coordination of social security systems for workers with nationality of Bosnia and Herzegovina, legally employed in the territory of a Member State, and for the members of their families legally resident there. To that effect, a decision of the Stabilisation and Association Council, which should not affect any rights or obligations arising from bilateral agreements where the latter provide for more favourable treatment, shall put the following provisions in place:\n(a)\nall periods of insurance, employment or residence completed by such workers in the various Member States shall be added together for the purpose of pensions and annuities in respect of old age, invalidity and death and for the purpose of medical care for such workers and such family members;\n(b)\nany pensions or annuities in respect of old age, death, industrial accident or occupational disease, or of invalidity resulting therefrom, with the exception of non-contributory benefits, shall be freely transferable at the rate applied by virtue of the law of the debtor Member State or States;\n(c)\nthe workers in question shall receive family allowances for the members of their families as defined above.\n2.

However, should the company, set up in accordance with the laws of a Member State or of Bosnia and Herzegovina, have only its registered office in the territory of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina respectively, the company shall be considered a Community company or a company of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the case may be, if its operations possess a real and continuous link with the economy of one of the Member States or of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(b)\n‘Subsidiary’ of a company shall mean a company which is effectively controlled by another company;\n(c)\n‘Branch’ of a company shall mean a place of business not having legal personality which has the appearance of permanency, such as the extension of a parent body, has a management and is materially equipped to negotiate business with third parties so that the latter, although knowing that there will if necessary be a legal link with the parent body, the head office of which is abroad, do not have to deal directly with such parent body but may transact business at the place of business constituting the extension;\n(d)\n‘Establishment’ shall mean:\n(i)\nas regards nationals, the right to take up economic activities as self-employed persons, and to set up undertakings, in particular companies, which they effectively control.

The Stabilisation and Association Council may extend or modify the scope of that Annex.\nArticle 51\n1.   Bosnia and Herzegovina shall facilitate the setting-up of operations on its territory by Community companies and nationals. To that end, Bosnia and Herzegovina shall grant, upon entry into force of this Agreement:\n(a)\nas regards the establishment of Community companies on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies or to any third country company, whichever is the better, and;\n(b)\nas regards the operation of subsidiaries and branches of Community companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina once established, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies and branches or to any subsidiary and branch of any third country company, whichever is the better.\n2.   The Community and its Member States shall grant, from the entry into force of this Agreement:\n(a)\nas regards the establishment of companies of Bosnia and Herzegovina treatment no less favourable than that accorded by Member States to their own companies or to any company of any third country, whichever is the better;\n(b)\nas regards the operation of subsidiaries and branches of companies of Bosnia and Herzegovina, established in its territory, treatment no less favourable than that accorded by Member States to their own companies and branches, or to any subsidiary and branch of any third country company, established in their territory, whichever is the better.\n3.   The Parties shall not adopt any new regulations or measures which introduce discrimination as regards the establishment of any other Party's companies on their territory or in respect of their operation, once established, by comparison with their own companies.\n4.   Four years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall establish the detailed arrangements to extend the above provisions to the establishment of Community nationals and nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take up economic activities as self-employed persons.\n5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article:\n(a)\nSubsidiaries and branches of Community companies shall have, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the right to use and rent real property in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(b)\nSubsidiaries of Community companies shall, from the entry into force of this Agreement, have the same rights to acquire and enjoy ownership rights over real property as companies of Bosnia and Herzegovina and as regards public goods/goods of common interest, the same rights as enjoyed by companies of Bosnia and Herzegovina where these rights are necessary for the conduct of the economic activities for which they are established. This point shall apply without prejudice to Article 63.\n(c)\nFour years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine the possibility of extending the rights referred to in point (b) to branches of Community companies.\nArticle 52\n1.   Subject to the provisions of Article 51, with the exception of financial services described in Annex VI, the Parties may regulate the establishment and operation of companies and nationals on their territory, insofar as these regulations do not discriminate against companies and nationals of the other Parties in comparison with its own companies and nationals.\n2.   In respect of financial services, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, a Party shall not be prevented from taking measures for prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. Such measures shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party's obligations under this Agreement.\n3.   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring a Party to disclose information relating to the affairs and accounts of individual customers or any confidential or proprietary information in the possession of public entities.\nArticle 53\n1.   Without prejudice to any provision to the contrary contained in the Multilateral Agreement on the Establishment of a European Common Aviation Area (4) (hereinafter referred to as ‘ECAA’), the provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to air transport services, inland waterways transport services and maritime cabotage services.\n2.   The Stabilisation and Association Council may make recommendations for improving establishment and operations in the areas covered by paragraph 1.\nArticle 54\n1.   The provisions of Articles 51 and 52 do not preclude the application by a Party of particular rules concerning the establishment and operation in its territory of branches of companies of another Party not incorporated in the territory of the first Party, which are justified by legal or technical differences between such branches as compared to branches of companies incorporated in its territory or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.\n2.   The difference in treatment shall not go beyond what is strictly necessary as a result of such legal or technical differences or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.\nArticle 55\nIn order to make it easier for Community nationals and nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take up and pursue regulated professional activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Community respectively, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine which steps are necessary for the mutual recognition of qualifications. It may take all necessary measures to that end.\nArticle 56\n1.   A Community company established in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina or a company of Bosnia and Herzegovina established in the Community shall be entitled to employ, or have employed by one of its subsidiaries or branches, in accordance with the legislation in force in the host territory of establishment, in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Community respectively, employees who are nationals of the Member States or nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina respectively, provided that such employees are key personnel as defined in paragraph 2 and that they are employed exclusively by companies, subsidiaries or branches. The residence and work permits of such employees shall only cover the period of such employment.\n2.   Key personnel of the abovementioned companies herein referred to as ‘organisations’ are ‘intra-corporate transferees’ as defined in point (c) of this paragraph in the following categories, provided that the organisation is a legal person and that the persons concerned have been employed by it or have been partners in it (other than as majority shareholders), for at least the year immediately preceding such movement:\n(a)\nPersons working in a senior position with an organisation, who primarily direct the management of the establishment, receiving general supervision or direction principally from the board of directors or stockholders of the business or their equivalent including:\n(i)\ndirecting the establishment of a department or sub-division of the establishment;\n(ii)\nsupervising and controlling the work of other supervisory, professional or managerial employees;\n(iii)\nhaving the authority personally to recruit and dismiss or recommend recruiting, dismissing or other personnel actions;\n(b)\nPersons working within an organisation who possess uncommon knowledge essential to the establishment's service, research equipment, techniques or management. The assessment of such knowledge may reflect, apart from knowledge specific to the establishment, a high level of qualification referring to a type of work or trade requiring specific technical knowledge, including membership of an accredited profession;\n(c)\nAn ‘intra-corporate transferee’ is defined as a natural person working within an organisation in the territory of a Party, and being temporarily transferred in the context of pursuit of economic activities in the territory of the other Party; the organisation concerned must have its principal place of business in the territory of a Party and the transfer be to an establishment (branch, subsidiary) of that organisation, effectively pursuing like economic activities in the territory of the other Party.\n3.   The entry into and the temporary presence within the territory of the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Community nationals respectively shall be permitted, when these representatives of companies are persons working in a senior position, as defined in paragraph 2(a), within a company, and are responsible for the setting up of a Community subsidiary or branch of a company of Bosnia and Herzegovina or of a subsidiary or branch of Bosnia and Herzegovina of a Community company in a Member State or in Bosnia and Herzegovina respectively, when:\n(a)\nthose representatives are not engaged in making direct sales or supplying services, and do not receive remuneration from a source located within the host territory of establishment, and;\n(b)\nthe company has its principal place of business outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively, and has no other representative, office, branch or subsidiary in that Member State or in Bosnia and Herzegovina respectively.\nCHAPTER III\nSupply of services\nArticle 57\n1.   The Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina undertake, in accordance with the following provisions, to take the necessary steps to allow progressively the supply of services by Community companies or companies of Bosnia and Herzegovina or by Community nationals or nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina which are established in the territory of a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.\n2.   In step with the liberalisation process mentioned in paragraph 1, the Parties shall permit the temporary movement of natural persons providing the service or who are employed by the service provider as key personnel as defined in Article 56(2), including natural persons who are representatives of a Community company or national or a company or national of Bosnia and Herzegovina and are seeking temporary entry for the purpose of negotiating for the sale of services or entering into agreements to sell services for that service provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves.\n3.   Four years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall take the measures necessary to implement progressively the provisions of paragraph 1. Account shall be taken of the progress achieved by the Parties in the approximation of their laws.\nArticle 58\n1.   The Parties shall not take any measures or actions which render the conditions for the supply of services by Community and nationals or companies of Bosnia and Herzegovina which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended significantly more restrictive as compared to the situation existing on the day preceding the day of entry into force of this Agreement.\n2.   If one Party is of the view that measures introduced by the other Party since the entry into force of this Agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, such first Party may request the other Party to enter into consultations.\nArticle 59\nWith regard to supply of transport services between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the following provisions shall apply:\n1)\nWith regard to land transport, Protocol 3 lays down the rules applicable to the relationship between the Parties in order to ensure, particularly, unrestricted road transit traffic across Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Community as a whole, the effective application of the principle of non discrimination and progressive harmonisation of the transport legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina with that of the Community.\n2)\nWith regard to international maritime transport, the Parties undertake to apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to international markets and trades on a commercial basis, and to respect international and European obligations in the field of safety, security and environmental standards.\nThe Parties affirm their commitment to a freely competitive environment as an essential feature of international maritime transport.\n3)\nIn applying the principles of paragraph 2, the Parties shall:\n(a)\nnot introduce cargo-sharing clauses in future bilateral Agreements with third countries;\n(b)\nabolish, upon the entry into force of this Agreement, all unilateral measures and administrative, technical and other obstacles that could have restrictive or discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport;\n(c)\neach Party shall grant, inter alia, no less favourable treatment for the ships operated by nationals or companies of the other Party than that accorded to a Party's own ships with regard to access to ports open to international trade, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading.\n4)\nWith a view to ensuring a coordinated development and progressive liberalisation of transport between the Parties adapted to their reciprocal commercial needs, the conditions of mutual market access in air transport shall be dealt with by the ECAA.\n5)\nPrior to the conclusion of the ECAA, the Parties shall not take any measures or actions which are more restrictive or discriminatory as compared with the situation existing prior to the entry into force of this Agreement.\n6)\nBosnia and Herzegovina shall adapt its legislation, including administrative, technical and other rules, to that of the Community existing at any time in the field of air, maritime, inland waterways and land transport insofar as it serves liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods.\n7)\nIn step with the common progress in the achievement of the objectives of this Chapter, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine ways of creating the conditions necessary for improving freedom to provide air and land transport services.\nCHAPTER IV\nCurrent payments and movement of capital\nArticle 60\nThe Parties undertake to authorise, in freely convertible currency, in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, any payments and transfers on the current account of balance of payments between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nArticle 61\n1.   With regard to transactions on the capital and financial account of balance of payments, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to direct investments made in companies formed in accordance with the laws of the host country and investments made in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Title V, and the liquidation or repatriation of these investments and of any profit stemming there from.\n2.   With regard to transactions on the capital and financial account of balance of payments, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to credits related to commercial transactions or to the provision of services in which a resident of one of the Parties is participating, and to financial loans and credits, with maturity longer than a year.\n3.   As from the entry into force of this Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina shall authorise, by making full and expedient use of its existing rules and procedures, the acquisition of real estate in Bosnia and Herzegovina by nationals of Member States.\nWithin six years from the entry into force of this Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina shall progressively adjust its legislation concerning the acquisition of real estate in Bosnia and Herzegovina by nationals of the Member States to ensure the same treatment as compared to its nationals.\nThe Parties shall also ensure, from the fifth year after the entry into force of this Agreement, free movement of capital relating to portfolio investment and financial loans and credits with maturity shorter than a year.\n4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Parties shall not introduce any new restrictions on the movement of capital and current payments between residents of the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina and shall not make the existing arrangements more restrictive.\n5.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 60 and of this Article, where, in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the operation of exchange rate policy or monetary policy in the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively, may take safeguard measures with regard to movements of capital between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina for a period not exceeding six months if such measures are strictly necessary.\n6.   Nothing in the above provisions shall be taken to limit the rights of economic operators of the Parties from benefiting from any more favourable treatment that may be provided for in any existing bilateral or multilateral agreement involving Parties to this Agreement.\n7.   The Parties shall consult each other with a view to facilitating the movement of capital between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to promote the objectives of this Agreement.\nArticle 62\n1.   During the first five years following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall take measures permitting the creation of the necessary conditions for the further gradual application of Community rules on the free movement of capital.\n2.   By the end of the fifth year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall determine the detailed arrangements for full application of Community rules on the movement of capital.\nCHAPTER V\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 63\n1.   The provisions of this Title shall be applied subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.\n2.   They shall not apply to activities that in the territory of any of the Parties are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.\nArticle 64\nFor the purpose of this Title, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parties from applying their laws and regulations regarding entry and stay, employment, working conditions, establishment of natural persons and supply of services, notably insofar as the granting, renewal, or refusal of a residence permit is concerned, provided that, in so doing, they do not apply them in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Party under the terms of a specific provision of this Agreement. This provision shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 63.\nArticle 65\nCompanies which are controlled and exclusively owned jointly by companies or nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Community companies or nationals shall also be covered by the provisions of this Title.\nArticle 66\n1.   The Most-Favoured-Nation treatment granted in accordance with the provisions of this Title shall not apply to the tax advantages that the Parties are providing or will provide in the future on the basis of agreements designed to avoid double taxation or other tax arrangements.\n2.   None of the provisions of this Title shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by the Parties of any measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes pursuant to the tax provisions of agreements to avoid double taxation and other tax arrangements or domestic fiscal legislation.\n3.   None of the provisions of this Title shall be construed to prevent Member States or Bosnia and Herzegovina from applying the relevant provisions of their fiscal legislation, from distinguishing between taxpayers who are not in identical situations, in particular as regards their place of residence.\nArticle 67\n1.   The Parties shall endeavour wherever possible to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, for balance of payments purposes. A Party adopting such measures shall present as soon as possible to the other Party a timetable for their removal.\n2.   Where one or more Member States or Bosnia and Herzegovina is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the WTO Agreement, adopt restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is strictly necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the case may be, shall inform the other Party forthwith.\n3.   Any restrictive measures shall not apply to transfers related to investment and in particular to the repatriation of amounts invested or reinvested or any kind of revenues stemming therefrom.\nArticle 68\nThe provisions of this Title shall be progressively adjusted, notably in the light of requirements arising from Article V of the GATS.\nArticle 69\nThe provisions of this Agreement shall not prejudice the application by any Party of any measure necessary to prevent the circumvention of its measures concerning third-country access to its market through the provisions of this Agreement.\nTITLE VI\nAPPROXIMATION OF LAWS, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMPETITION RULES\nArticle 70\n1.   The Parties recognise the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Bosnia and Herzegovina shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Bosnia and Herzegovina shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced.\n2.   This approximation shall start on the date of signing of this Agreement, and shall gradually extend to all the elements of the Community acquis referred to in this Agreement by the end of the transitional period defined in Article 8 of this Agreement.\n3.   Approximation shall, at an early stage, focus on fundamental elements of the Internal Market acquis as well as on other trade-related areas. At a further stage Bosnia and Herzegovina shall focus on the remaining parts of the acquis.\nApproximation shall be carried out on the basis of a programme to be agreed between the European Commission and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n4.   Bosnia and Herzegovina shall also define, in agreement with the European Commission, the detailed arrangements for the monitoring of the implementation of approximation of legislation and law enforcement actions to be taken.\nArticle 71\nCompetition and other economic provisions\n1.   The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n(a)\nall agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;\n(b)\nabuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;\n(c)\nany State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain products.\n2.   Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition rules applicable in the Community, in particular from Articles 81, 82, 86 and 87 of the EC Treaty and interpretative instruments adopted by the Community institutions.\n3.   The Parties shall ensure that an operationally independent public authority is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(a) and (b), regarding private and public undertakings and undertakings to which special rights have been granted.\n4.

assembly or specific operations;\n(b)\n‘material’ means any ingredient, raw material, component or part, etc., used in the manufacture of the product;\n(c)\n‘product’ means the product being manufactured, even if it is intended for later use in another manufacturing operation;\n(d)\n‘goods’ means both materials and products;\n(e)\n‘customs value’ means the value as determined in accordance with the 1994 Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (WTO Agreement on customs valuation);\n(f)\n‘ex-works price’ means the price paid for

the materials used, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported;\n(g)\n‘value of materials’ means the customs value at the time of importation of the non-originating materials used, or, if this is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the materials in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(h)\n‘value of originating materials’ means the value of such materials as defined in (g) applied mutatis mutandis;\n(i)\n‘value added’ shall be taken to be the ex-works price minus the customs value of each of the materials incorporated which originate in the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 or, where the customs value is not known or cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the materials in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(j)\n‘chapters’ and ‘headings’ mean the chapters and the headings (four-digit codes) used in the nomenclature which makes up the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System, referred to in this Protocol as ‘the Harmonised System’ or ‘HS’;\n(k)\n‘classified’ refers to the classification of a product or material under a

PRODUCTS’\nArticle 2\nGeneral requirements\n1.   For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the Community:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in the Community within the meaning of Article 5;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in the Community incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Community within the meaning of Article 6.\n2.   For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the meaning of Article 5;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in Bosnia and Herzegovina incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the meaning of Article 6.\nArticle 3\nCumulation in the Community\n1.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in the Community if such products are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the Community, in any country or territory participating in the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process (1), or incorporating the materials originating in Turkey to which the Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 (2) applies, provided that the working or processing carried out in the Community goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.\n2.   Where the working or processing carried out in the Community does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the Community only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the Community.\n3.   Products, originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1, which do not undergo any working or processing in the Community, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.\n4.   The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:\n(a)\na preferential trade agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is applicable between the countries or territories involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination;\n(b)\nmaterials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol;\nand\n(c)\nnotices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in Bosnia and Herzegovina according to its own procedures.\nThe cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).\nThe Community shall provide Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the European Commission, with details of the Agreements and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1.\nThe products in Annex V shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in this Article.\nArticle 4\nCumulation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n1.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2), products shall be considered as originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina if such products are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in the Community, Bosnia and Herzegovina, or in any country or territory participating in the European Union's Stabilisation and Association Process (3), or incorporating the materials originating in Turkey to which the Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 (4) applies, provided that the working or processing carried out in Bosnia and Herzegovina goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.\n2.   Where the working or processing carried out in Bosnia and Herzegovina does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n3.   Products, originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1, which do not undergo any working or processing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.\n4.   The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:\n(a)\na preferential trade agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is applicable between the countries or territories involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination;\n(b)\nmaterials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol;\nand\n(c)\nnotices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in Bosnia and Herzegovina according to its own procedures.\nThe cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).\nBosnia and Herzegovina shall provide the Community, through the European Commission with details of the Agreements, including their dates of entry into force, and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1.\nThe products in Annex V shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in this Article.\nArticle 5\nWholly obtained products\n1.   The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n(a)\nmineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;\n(b)\nvegetable products harvested there;\n(c)\nlive animals born and raised there;\n(d)\nproducts from live animals raised there;\n(e)\nproducts obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;\n(f)\nproducts of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina by their vessels;\n(g)\nproducts made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f);\n(h)\nused articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;\n(i)\nwaste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n(j)\nproducts extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;\n(k)\ngoods produced there exclusively from the products specified in (a) to (j).\n2.   The terms ‘their vessels’ and ‘their factory ships’ in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:\n(a)\nwhich are registered or recorded in a Member State of the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(b)\nwhich sail under the flag of a Member State of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(c)\nwhich are owned to an extent of at least 50 % by nationals of a Member State of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or by a company with its head office in one of these States, of which the manager or managers, Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of a Member State of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States;\n(d)\nof which the master and officers are nationals of a Member State of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\nand\n(e)\nof which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of a Member State of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nArticle 6\nSufficiently worked or processed products\n1.   For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.\nThe conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:\n(a)\ntheir total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;\n(b)\nany of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.\nThis paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 7.\nArticle 7\nInsufficient working or processing\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 6 are satisfied:\n(a)\npreserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;\n(b)\nbreaking-up and assembly of packages;\n(c)\nwashing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;\n(d)\nironing or pressing of textiles;\n(e)\nsimple painting and polishing operations;\n(f)\nhusking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;\n(g)\noperations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps;\n(h)\npeeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;\n(i)\nsharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;\n(j)\nsifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);\n(k)\nsimple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;\n(l)\naffixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n(m)\nsimple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any other material;\n(n)\nsimple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;\n(o)\na combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (n);\n(p)\nslaughter of animals.\n2.   All operations carried out either in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.\nArticle 8\nUnit of qualification\n1.   The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.\nIt follows that:\n(a)\nwhen a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;\n(b)\nwhen a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.\n2.   Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.\nArticle 9\nAccessories, spare parts and tools\nAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.\nArticle 10\nSets\nSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.\nArticle 11\nNeutral elements\nIn order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:\n(a)\nenergy and fuel;\n(b)\nplant and equipment;\n(c)\nmachines and tools;\n(d)\ngoods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.\nTITLE III\nTERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS\nArticle 12\nPrinciple of territoriality\n1.   Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 4 and paragraph 3 of this Article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n2.   Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 4, where originating goods exported from the Community or from Bosnia and Herzegovina to another country return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nthe returning goods are the same as those exported;\nand\n(b)\nthey have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.\n3.   The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina on materials exported from the Community or from Bosnia and Herzegovina and subsequently re-imported there, provided:\n(a)\nthe said materials are wholly obtained in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 7 prior to being exported;\nand\n(b)\nit can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(i)\nthe re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials;\nand\n(ii)\nthe total added value acquired outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed.\n4.   For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina. But where, in the list in Annex II, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.\n5.   For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, ‘total added value’ shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the value of the materials incorporated there.\n6.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 6(2) is applied.\n7.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products of Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.\n8.   Any working or processing of the kind covered by the provisions of this Article and done outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements.\nArticle 13\nDirect transport\n1.   The preferential treatment provided for under this Agreement applies only to products, satisfying the requirements of this Protocol, which are transported directly between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina or through the territories of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4. However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.\nOriginating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n2.   Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:\n(a)\na single transport document covering the passage from the exporting country through the country of transit; or\n(b)\na certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:\n(i)\ngiving an exact description of the products;\n(ii)\nstating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used;\nand\n(iii)\ncertifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or\n(c)\nfailing these, any substantiating documents.\nArticle 14\nExhibitions\n1.   Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than those referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and sold after the exhibition for importation in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nan exporter has consigned these products from the Community or from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;\n(b)\nthe products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(c)\nthe products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition;\nand\n(d)\nthe products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.\n2.   A proof of origin must be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.\nTITLE IV\nDRAWBACK OR EXEMPTION\nArticle 15\nProhibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties\n1.   Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the Community, in Bosnia and Herzegovina or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.\n2.   The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there.\n3.   The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.\n4.   The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 8(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 9 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 10 when such items are non-originating.\n5.   The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which this Agreement applies. Furthermore, they shall not preclude the application of an export refund system for agricultural products, applicable upon export in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\nTITLE V\nPROOF OF ORIGIN\nArticle 16\nGeneral requirements\n1.   Products originating in the Community shall, on importation into Bosnia and Herzegovina and products originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina shall, on importation into the Community benefit from this Agreement upon submission of either:\n(a)\na movement certificate EUR.1, a specimen of which appears in Annex III; or\n(b)\nin the cases specified in Article 22(1), a declaration, subsequently referred to as the ‘invoice declaration’, given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified; the text of the invoice declaration appears in Annex IV.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, in the cases specified in Article 27, benefit from this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to above.\nArticle 17\nProcedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1\n1.   A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.\n2.   For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex III. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which this Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.\n3.   The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n4.   A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Member State of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, Bosnia and Herzegovina or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n5.   The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.\n6.   The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.\n7.   A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.\nArticle 18\nMovement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively\n1.   Notwithstanding Article 17(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:\n(a)\nit was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances;\nor\n(b)\nit is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.\n2.   For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.\n3.   The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file.\n4.   Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with the following phrase in English: ‘ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY’.\n5.   The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the ‘Remarks’ box of the movement certificate EUR.1.\nArticle 19\nIssue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1\n1.   In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.\n2.   The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with the following word in English: ‘DUPLICATE’.\n3.   The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the ‘Remarks’ box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.\n4.   The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.\nArticle 20\nIssue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously\nWhen originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.\nArticle 21\nAccounting segregation\n1.   Where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called ‘accounting segregation’ method to be used for managing such stocks.\n2.   This method must be able to ensure that, for a specific reference-period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as originating is the same as that which would have been obtained if there had been physical segregation of the stocks.\n3.   The customs authorities may grant such authorisation, subject to any conditions deemed appropriate.\n4.   This method is recorded and applied on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured.\n5.   The beneficiary of this facilitation may issue or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.\n6.   The customs authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation and may withdraw it at any time whenever the beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.\nArticle 22\nConditions for making out an invoice declaration\n1.   An invoice declaration as referred to in Article 16(1)(b) may be made out:\n(a)\nby an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23;\nor\n(b)\nby any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed EUR 6 000.\n2.   An invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Bosnia and Herzegovina or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n3.   The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n4.   An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.\n5.   Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.\n6.   An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.\nArticle 23\nApproved exporter\n1.   The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter, hereinafter referred to as ‘approved exporter’, who makes frequent shipments of products under this Agreement to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.\n3.   The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the invoice declaration.\n4.   The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.\n5.   The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.\nArticle 24\nValidity of proof of origin\n1.   A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.\n2.   Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.\n3.   In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.\nArticle 25\nSubmission of proof of origin\nProofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this Agreement.\nArticle 26\nImportation by instalments\nWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.\nArticle 27\nExemptions from proof of origin\n1.   Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.\n2.   Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.\n3.   Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.\nArticle 28\nSupporting documents\nThe documents referred to in Articles 17(3) and 22(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Bosnia and Herzegovina or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist inter alia of the following:\n(a)\ndirect evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal book-keeping;\n(b)\ndocuments proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;\n(c)\ndocuments proving the working or processing of materials in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina, issued or made out in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;\n(d)\nmovement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with this Protocol, or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4, in accordance with rules of origin which are identical to the rules in this Protocol;\n(e)\nappropriate evidence concerning working or processing undergone outside the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina by application of Article 12, proving that the requirements of that Article have been satisfied.\nArticle 29\nPreservation of proof of origin and supporting documents\n1.   The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the documents referred to in Article 17(3).\n2.   The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall keep for at least three years a copy of this invoice declaration as well as the documents referred to in Article 22(3).\n3.   The customs authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in Article 17(2).\n4.   The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them.\nArticle 30\nDiscrepancies and formal errors\n1.   The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.\n2.   Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in the document.\nArticle 31\nAmounts expressed in euro\n1.   For the application of the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Community, of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.\n2.   A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) or Article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.\n3.   The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.\n4.   A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n5.   The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Stabilisation and Association Committee at the request of the Community or of Bosnia and Herzegovina. When carrying out this review, the Stabilisation and Association Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.\nTITLE VI\nARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nArticle 32\nMutual assistance\n1.   The customs authorities of the Member States of the Community and of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations.\n2.   In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 or the invoice declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.\nArticle 33\nVerification of proofs of origin\n1.   Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.\n2.   For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.\n3.   The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.\n4.   If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.\n5.   The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Bosnia and Herzegovina or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n6.   If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.\nArticle 34\nDispute settlement\nWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 33 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Stabilisation and Association Committee.\nIn all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.\nArticle 35\nPenalties\nPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.\nArticle 36\nFree zones\n1.   The Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.\n2.   By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or in Bosnia and Herzegovina are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.\nTITLE VII\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\nArticle 37\nApplication of this Protocol\n1.   The term ‘Community’ used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta or Melilla.\n2.   Products originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina, when imported into Ceuta and Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities. Bosnia and Herzegovina shall grant to imports of products covered by this Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community.\n3.   For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 38.\nArticle 38\nSpecial conditions\n1.   Providing they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, the following shall be considered as:\n1.1.\nproducts originating in Ceuta and Melilla:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that:\n(i)\nthe said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 6;\nor that\n(ii)\nthose products are originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina or in the Community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7;\n1.2.\nproducts originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that:\n(i)\nthe said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 6;\nor that\n(ii)\nthose products are originating in Ceuta and Melilla or in the Community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7.\n2.   Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.\n3.   The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter ‘Bosnia and Herzegovina’ and ‘Ceuta and Melilla’ in Box 2 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations. In addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in Box 4 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations.\n4.   The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.\nTITLE VIII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 39\nAmendments to this Protocol\nThe Stabilisation and Association Council may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.\n(1)  As defined in the Conclusions of the General Affairs Council in April 1997 and Commission Communication of May 1999 on the establishment of the Stabilisation and Association process with Western Balkan countries.\n(2)  Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 applies to products other than agricultural products as defined in the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey and other than coal and steel products as defined in the Agreement between the European Coal and Steel Community and the Republic of Turkey on trade in products covered by the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community.\n(3)  As defined in the Conclusions of the General Affairs Council in April 1997 and Commission Communication of May 1999 on the establishment of the Stabilisation and Association process with Western Balkan countries.\n(4)  Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 applies to products other than agricultural products as defined in the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey and other than coal and steel products as defined in the Agreement between the European Coal and Steel Community and the Republic of Turkey on trade in products covered by the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community.\nANNEX I TO PROTOCOL 2\nINTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II\nNote 1\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 6 of Protocol 2.\nNote 2\n2.1.\nThe first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ‘ex’, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n2.2.\nWhere several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.\n2.3.\nWhere there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.\n2.4.\nWhere, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.\nNote 3\n3.1.\nThe provisions of Article 6 of Protocol 2, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a party.\nExample:\nAn engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging’ of heading ex 7224.\nIf this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.\n3.2.\nThe rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\n3.3.\nWithout prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading’, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.\nHowever, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.\n3.4.\nWhen a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\nExample:\nThe rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.\n3.5.\nWhere a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).\nExample:\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.\nHowever, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\nExample:\nIn the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth – even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is, the fibre stage.\n3.6.\nWhere, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.\nNote 4\n4.1.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.\n4.2.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.\n4.3.\nThe terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n4.4.\nThe term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.\nNote 5\n5.1.\nWhere, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)\n5.2.\nHowever, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n—\nsilk,\n—\nwool,\n—\ncoarse animal hair,\n—\nfine animal hair,\n—\nhorsehair,\n—\ncotton,\n—\npaper-making materials and paper,\n—\nflax,\n—\ntrue hemp,\n—\njute and other textile bast fibres,\n—\nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,\n—\ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,\n—\nsynthetic man-made filaments,\n—\nartificial man-made filaments,\n—\ncurrent-conducting filaments,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),\n—\nother synthetic man-made staple fibres,\n—\nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n—\nother artificial man-made staple fibres,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,\n—\nproducts of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,\n—\nother products of heading 5605.\nExample:\nA yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.\nExample:\nA woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.\nExample:\nTufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\nExample:\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.\n5.3.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.\n5.4.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.\nNote 6\n6.1.\nWhere, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.\n6.2.\nWithout prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.\nExample:\nIf a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\n6.3.\nWhere a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\nNote 7\n7.1.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation.\n7.2.\nFor the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation;\n(j)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n(k)\nin respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n(l)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n(m)\nin respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;\n(n)\nin respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;\n(o)\nin respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.\n7.3.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.\nANNEX II TO PROTOCOL 2\nLIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS\nThe products mentioned in the list may not be all covered by this Agreement. It is, therefore, necessary to consult the other parts of this Agreement.\nHS heading\nDescription of product\nWorking or processing, carried out on non-originating materials, which confers originating status\n(1)\n(2)\n(3) or (4)\nChapter 1\nLive animals\nAll the animals of Chapter 1 shall be wholly obtained\nChapter 2\nMeat and edible meat offal\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapters 1 and 2 used are wholly obtained\nChapter 3\nFish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapter 3 used are wholly obtained\nex Chapter 4\nDairy produce;

Cooperation shall cover land transport, and in particular road, rail and combined transport, and shall include the relevant infrastructure.\n2.   In this connection, the scope of this Protocol shall cover in particular:\n—\ntransport infrastructure in the territory of one or other Party to the extent necessary to achieve the objective of this Protocol,\n—\nmarket access, on a reciprocal basis, in the field of road transport,\n—\nessential legal and administrative supporting measures including commercial, taxation, social and technical measures,\n—\ncooperation in developing a transport system which meets environmental needs,\n—\na regular exchange of information on the development of the transport policies of the Parties, with particular regard to transport infrastructure.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Protocol, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)   Community transit traffic: the carriage, by a carrier established in the Community, of goods in transit through the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina ‘en route’ to or from a Member State of the Community;\n(b)   Bosnia and Herzegovina's transit traffic: the carriage, by a carrier established in Bosnia and Herzegovina, of goods in transit from Bosnia and Herzegovina through Community territory and destined for a third country or of goods from a third country destined for Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(c)   combined transport: the transport of goods where the lorry, trailer, semi-trailer, with or without tractor unit, swap body or container of 20 feet or more, uses the road on the initial or final leg of the journey and on the other leg, rail or inland waterway or maritime services where this section exceeds 100 kilometres as the crow flies and make the initial or final road transport leg of the journey;\n—\nbetween the point where the goods are loaded and the nearest suitable rail loading station for the initial leg, and between the nearest suitable rail unloading station and the point where the goods are unloaded for the final leg, or\n—\nwithin a radius not exceeding 150 km as the crow flies from the inland waterway port or seaport of loading or unloading.\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nArticle 4\nGeneral Provision\nThe Parties hereby agree to adopt mutually coordinated measures to develop a multimodal transport infrastructure network as a vital means of solving the problems affecting the carriage of goods through Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular on the Pan-European Corridor V and the Inland Waterway Sava connection to Corridor VII, which form part of the Core Regional Transport Network as defined in the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in Article 5.\nArticle 5\nPlanning\nThe development of a multimodal regional transport network on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina which serves the needs of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the South-Eastern European region covering the main road and rail routes, inland waterways, inland ports, ports, airports and other relevant modes of the network is of particular interest to the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This network was defined in a Memorandum of Understanding for developing a Core Transport Infrastructure Network for South East Europe which was signed by ministers from the region, and the European Commission, in June 2004. The development of the network and the selection of priorities is being carried out by a Steering Committee comprised of representatives of each of the signatories.\nArticle 6\nFinancial aspects\n1.   The Community may contribute financially, under Article 112 of this Agreement, to the necessary infrastructure work referred to in Article 5 of this Protocol. This financial contribution may take the form of credit from the European Investment Bank and any other form of financing which can provide further additional resources.\n2.   In order to speed up the work the European Commission will endeavour, as far as possible, to encourage the use of additional resources such as investment by certain Member States on a bilateral basis or from public or private funds.\nRAIL AND COMBINED TRANSPORT\nArticle 7\nGeneral provision\nThe Parties shall adopt the mutually coordinated measures necessary for the development and promotion of rail and combined transport as a mean of ensuring that in the future a major proportion of their bilateral and transit transport through Bosnia and Herzegovina is performed under more environmentally-friendly conditions.\nArticle 8\nParticular aspects relating to infrastructure\nAs part of the modernisation of the railways of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the necessary steps shall be taken to adapt the system for combined transport, with particular regard to the development or building of terminals, tunnel gauges and capacity, which require substantial investment.\nArticle 9\nSupporting measures\nThe Parties shall take all the steps necessary to encourage the development of combined transport.\nThe purpose of such measures shall be:\n—\nto encourage the use of combined transport by users and consignors,\n—\nto make combined transport competitive with road transport, in particular through the financial support of the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina in the context of their respective legislation,\n—\nto encourage the use of combined transport over long distances and to promote, in particular the use of swap bodies, containers and unaccompanied transport in general,\n—\nto improve the speed and reliability of combined transport and in particular:\n—\nto increase the frequency of convoys in accordance with the needs of consignors and users,\n—\nto reduce the waiting time at terminals and increase their productivity,\n—\nto remove in an appropriate manner, all obstacles from the approach routes so as to improve access to combined transport,\n—\nto harmonise, where necessary, the weights, dimensions and technical characteristics of specialised equipment, in particular so as to ensure the necessary compatibility of gauges, and to take coordinated action to order and to put into service such equipment as is required by the level of traffic,\n—\nand, in general, to take any other appropriate action.\nArticle 10\nThe role of the railways\nIn connection with the respective powers of the States and the railways, the Parties shall, in respect of both passenger and goods transport, recommend that their railways:\n—\nstep up cooperation, whether bilateral, multilateral or within international railway organisations, in all fields, with particular regard to the improvement of the quality and the safety of transport services,\n—\ntry to establish in common a system of organising the railways so as to encourage consignors to send freight by rail rather than road, in particular for transit purposes, on a basis of fair competition and while leaving the user freedom of choice in this matter,\n—\nprepare the participation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the implementation and future evolution of the Community acquis on the development of the railways.\nROAD TRANSPORT\nArticle 11\nGeneral Provisions\n1.   With regard to mutual access to transport markets, the Parties agree, initially and without prejudice to paragraph 2, to maintain the regime resulting from bilateral Agreements or other existing international bilateral instruments concluded between each Member State of the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina or, where there are no such Agreements or instruments, arising from the de facto situation in 1991.\nHowever, whilst awaiting the conclusion of Agreements between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina on access to the road transport market, as provided for in Article 12, and on road taxation, as provided for in Article 13(2), Bosnia and Herzegovina shall cooperate with the Member States of the Community to amend these bilateral Agreements to adapt them to this Protocol.\n2.   The Parties hereby agree to grant unrestricted access to Community transit traffic through Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Bosnia and Herzegovina's transit traffic through the Community with effect from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n3.   If, as a result of the rights granted under paragraph 2, transit traffic by Community hauliers increases to such a degree as to cause or threaten to cause serious harm to road infrastructure and/or traffic fluidity on the axes mentioned in Article 5, and under the same circumstances problems arise on Community territory close to the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the matter shall be submitted to the Stabilisation and Association Council in accordance with Article 117 of this Agreement. The Parties may propose exceptional temporary, non-discriminatory measures as are necessary to limit or mitigate such harm.\n4.   If the Community establishes rules aiming to reduce pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles registered in the European Union and to improve traffic safety, a similar regime shall apply to heavy goods vehicles registered in Bosnia and Herzegovina that wish to circulate through the Community territory. The Stabilisation and Association Council shall decide on the necessary modalities.\n5.   The Parties shall refrain from taking any unilateral action that might lead to discrimination between Community carriers or vehicles and carriers or vehicles from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Each Party shall take all steps necessary to facilitate road transport to or through the territory of the other Party.\nArticle 12\nAccess to the market\nThe Parties shall, as a matter of priority, undertake to work together to seek, each of them subject to their internal rules:\n—\ncourses of action likely to favour the development of a transport system which meets the needs of the Parties, and which is compatible, on the one hand, with the completion of the internal Community market and the implementation of the common transport policy and, on the other hand, with economic and transport policies of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n—\na definitive system for regulating future road transport market access between Parties on the basis of reciprocity.\nArticle 13\nTaxation, tolls and other charges\n1.   The Parties accept that the taxation of road vehicles, tolls and other charges on either side must be non-discriminatory.\n2.   The Parties shall enter into negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement on road taxation, as soon as possible, on the basis of the rules adopted by the Community on this matter. The purpose of such Agreement shall be, in particular, to ensure the free flow of trans-frontier traffic, to progressively eliminate differences between the road taxation systems applied by the Parties and to eliminate distortions of competition arising from such differences.\n3.   Pending the conclusion of the negotiations mentioned in paragraph 2, the Parties will eliminate discrimination between hauliers of the Community and of Bosnia and Herzegovina when levying taxes and charges on the circulation and/or possession of heavy goods vehicles as well as taxes or charges levied on transport operations in the territory of the Parties. Bosnia and Herzegovina undertakes to notify the European Commission, if so requested, the amount of taxes, tolls and charges which they apply, as well as the methods of calculating them.\n4.   Until the conclusion of the Agreements mentioned in paragraph 2 and in Article 12 any change proposed after the entry into force of this Agreement to fiscal charges, tolls or other charges, including the systems for their collection which may be applied to Community traffic in transit through Bosnia and Herzegovina will be subject to a prior consultation procedure.\nArticle 14\nWeights and dimensions\n1.   Bosnia and Herzegovina accepts that road vehicles complying with Community standards on weights and dimensions may circulate freely and without hindrance in this respect on the routes covered by Article 5. During six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, road vehicles which do not comply with existing standards of Bosnia and Herzegovina may be subject to a special non-discriminatory charge which reflects the damage caused by additional axle weight.\n2.   Bosnia and Herzegovina will endeavour to harmonise its existing regulations and standards for road construction with the legislation prevailing in the Community by the end of the fifth year after the entry into force of this Agreement and will make major efforts for improvement of the existing routes covered by Article 5 to those new regulations and standards within the proposed time, in accordance with its financial possibilities.\nArticle 15\nEnvironment\n1.   In order to protect environment, the Parties shall endeavour to introduce standards on gaseous and particulate emissions and noise levels for heavy goods vehicles, which ensure a high level of protection.\n2.   In order to provide the industry with clear information and to encourage coordinated research, programming and production, exceptional national standards in this field shall be avoided.\n3.   Vehicles which comply with standards laid down by international Agreements also relating to environment may operate without further restrictions in the territory of the Parties.\n4.   For the purpose of introducing new standards, the Parties shall work together to achieve the abovementioned objectives.\nArticle 16\nSocial aspects\n1.   Bosnia and Herzegovina shall harmonise its legislation on the training of road haulage personnel, particularly with respect to the carriage of dangerous goods, to the Community standards.\n2.   Bosnia and Herzegovina as a contracting party to the European Agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport (ERTA), and the Community will coordinate to the maximum extent possible their policies concerning driving time, interruptions and rest periods for drivers and crew composition, in respect of the future development of the social legislation in this area.\n3.   The Parties shall cooperate with regard to implementation and enforcement of the social legislation in the field of road transport.\n4.   The Parties shall ensure the equivalence of their respective laws on the admission to the occupation of road haulage operator, with a view to their mutual recognition.\nArticle 17\nProvisions relating to traffic\n1.   The Parties shall pool their experience and endeavour to harmonise their legislation so as to improve the flow of traffic during peak periods (weekends, public holidays, the tourist season).\n2.   In general, the Parties shall encourage the introduction, development and coordination of a road traffic information system.\n3.   They shall endeavour to harmonise their legislation on the carriage of perishable goods, live animals and dangerous substances.\n4.   The Parties shall also endeavour to harmonise the technical assistance to be provided to drivers, the dissemination of essential information on traffic and other matters of concern to tourists, and emergency services including ambulance services.\nArticle 18\nRoad Safety\n1.   Bosnia and Herzegovina shall harmonise its legislation on road safety, particularly with regard to the transport of dangerous goods, to that of the Community by the end of the third year after the entry into force of this Agreement.\n2.   Bosnia and Herzegovina as a contracting Party of the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) and the Community will coordinate to the maximum extent possible their policies concerning the carriage of dangerous goods.\n3.   The Parties shall cooperate with regard to implementation and enforcement of road safety legislation, particularly on driving licences and measures to reduce road accidents.\nSIMPLIFICATION OF FORMALITIES\nArticle 19\nSimplification of formalities\n1.   The Parties agree to simplify the flow of goods by rail and road, whether bilateral or in transit.\n2.   The Parties agree to begin negotiations with a view to concluding an Agreement on the facilitation of controls and formalities relating to the carriage of goods.\n3.

In order to comply with a request for assistance, the requested authority shall proceed, within the limits of its competence and available resources, as though it were acting on its own account or at the request of other authorities of that same Party, by supplying information already possessed, by carrying out appropriate enquiries or by arranging for them to be carried out. This provision shall also apply to any other authority to which the request has been addressed by the requested authority when the latter cannot act on its own.\n2.   Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the legal or regulatory provisions of the requested Party.\n3.   Duly authorised officials of a Party may, with the agreement of the other Party and subject to the conditions laid down by the latter, be present to obtain in the offices of the requested authority or any other concerned authority in accordance with paragraph 1, information relating to activities that are or may be operations in breach of customs legislation which the applicant authority needs for the purposes of this Protocol.\n4.

Where the Parties have failed to resolve the dispute, the complaining Party may under the conditions of Article 126 of this Agreement, submit a request in writing for the establishment of an arbitration panel to the Party complained against as well as to the Stabilisation and Association Committee.\n2.   The complaining Party shall state in its request the subject-matter of the dispute and, as the case may be, the measure adopted by the other Party, or the failure to act, which it considers to be in breach of the provisions referred to in Article 2 of this Protocol.\nArticle 4\nComposition of the arbitration panel\n1.   An arbitration panel shall be composed of three arbitrators.\n2.   Within 10 days of the date of the submission of the request for the establishment of an arbitration panel to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, the Parties shall consult in order to reach an agreement on the composition of the arbitration panel.\n3.   In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on its composition within the time frame laid down in paragraph 2, either Party may request the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or her or his delegate, to select all three members by lot from the list established under Article 15, one among the individuals proposed by the complaining Party, one among the individuals proposed by the Party complained against and one among the arbitrators selected by the Parties to act as chairperson.\nIn case the Parties agree on one or more of the members of the arbitration panel, any remaining members shall be appointed in accordance with the same procedure.\n4.   The selection of the arbitrators by the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or her or his delegate, shall be done in the presence of a representative of each Party.\n5.   The date of establishment of the arbitration panel shall be the date on which the chairperson of the panel is informed of the appointment in common agreement between the Parties of the three arbitrators or, as the case may be, the date of their selection in accordance with paragraph 3.\n6.   Where a Party considers that an arbitrator does not comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct referred to in Article 18, the Parties shall consult and, if they so agree, replace the arbitrator and select a replacement pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article. If the Parties fail to agree on the need to replace an arbitrator, the matter shall be referred to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, whose decision will be final.\nWhere a Party considers that the chairperson of the arbitration panel does not comply with the Code of Conduct referred to in Article 18, the matter shall be referred to one of the remaining members of the pool of arbitrators selected to act as chairperson, her or his name being drawn by lot by the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or her or his delegate, in the presence of a representative of each Party, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.\n7.   If an arbitrator is unable to participate in the proceeding, withdraws or is replaced pursuant to paragraph 6, a replacement shall be selected within five days in accordance with the selection procedures followed to select the original arbitrator. The panel proceedings will be suspended for the period taken to carry out this procedure.\nArticle 5\nArbitration panel ruling\n1.   The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee within 90 days from the date of the establishment of the arbitration panel. Where it considers that this deadline cannot be met, the chairperson of the panel must notify the Parties and the Stabilisation and Association Committee in writing, stating the reasons for the delay. Under no circumstances should the ruling be issued later than 120 days from the date of the establishment of the panel.\n2.   In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to issue its ruling within 45 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. Under no circumstance should it take longer than 100 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. The arbitration panel may give a preliminary ruling within 10 days of its establishment on whether it deems the case to be urgent.\n3.   The ruling shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that it makes. The ruling may contain recommendations on the measures to be adopted for compliance with it.\n4.   The complaining Party may withdraw its complaint by written notification to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, the Party complained against and the Stabilisation and Association Committee, at any time before the ruling is notified to the Parties and the Stabilisation and Association Committee. Such withdrawal is without prejudice to the complaining Party's right to introduce a new complaint regarding the same measure at a later point in time.\n5.   The arbitration panel shall, at the request of both Parties, suspend its work at any time for a period not exceeding 12 months. Once the period of 12 months has been exceeded, the authority for the establishment of the panel will lapse, without prejudice to the right of the complaining Party to request at a later stage the establishment of a panel on the same measure.\nSection II\nCompliance\nArticle 6\nCompliance with the arbitration panel ruling\nEach Party shall take any measure necessary to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, and the Parties will endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time to comply with the ruling.\nArticle 7\nReasonable period of time for compliance\n1.   No later than 30 days after the notification of the arbitration panel ruling to the Parties, the Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party of the time it will require for compliance (hereinafter referred to as ‘reasonable period of time’). Both parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time.\n2.   If there is disagreement between the Parties on the reasonable period of time to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, the complaining Party may request the Stabilisation and Association Committee, within 20 days of the notification made under paragraph 1, to reconvene the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling within 20 days from the date of the submission of the request.\n3.   In the event of the original panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures set out in Article 4 shall apply. The time limit for notifying the ruling remains 20 days from the date of the panel's establishment.\nArticle 8\nReview of any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee before the end of the reasonable period of time of any measure that it has taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling.\n2.   In the event that there is disagreement between the Parties concerning the compatibility of any measure notified under paragraph 1 of this Article with the provisions referred to in Article 2, the complaining Party may request the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall explain why the measure is not in conformity with this Agreement. Once re-convened, the arbitration panel will issue its ruling within 45 days of the date of its re-establishment.\n3.   In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article 4 shall apply. The time limit for notifying the ruling remains 45 days from the date of the panel's establishment.\nArticle 9\nTemporary remedies in case of non-compliance\n1.   If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the arbitration panel rules that the measure notified under Article 8(1) is not in conformity with that Party's obligations under this Agreement, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, present an offer for temporary compensation.\n2.   If no agreement on compensation is reached within 30 days of the end of the reasonable period of time, or of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 8 that a measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, to suspend the application of benefits granted under the provisions referred to in Article 2 at a level equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation. The complaining Party may implement the suspension 10 days after the date of the notification, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph 3 of this Article.\n3.   If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation, it may request in writing to the chairperson of the original arbitration panel before the expiry of the 10 day period referred to in paragraph 2 for the reconvening of the original arbitration panel. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of benefits to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee within 30 days of the date of the submission of the request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration panel has issued its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the ruling of the arbitration panel.\n4.   The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall be applied only until any measure found to violate this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with this Agreement, or until the Parties have agreed to settle the dispute.\nArticle 10\nReview of any measure taken to comply after the suspension of benefits\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee of any measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its request for an end to the suspension of benefits applied by the complaining Party.\n2.   If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with this Agreement within 30 days of the date of the submission of the notification, the complaining Party may request in writing to the chairperson of the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the arbitration panel will determine whether the complaining party can continue the suspension of benefits at the original or at a different level. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity with this Agreement, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated.\n3.   In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article 4 shall apply. The period for notifying the ruling remains 45 days from the date of the panel's establishment.\nSection III\nCommon provisions\nArticle 11\nOpen Hearings\nThe meetings of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public under the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure referred to in Article 18, unless the arbitration panel decides otherwise on its own motion or at the request of the Parties.\nArticle 12\nInformation and technical advice\nAt the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the panel may seek information from any source it deems appropriate for the panel proceeding. The panel will also have the right to seek the opinion of experts as it deems appropriate. Any information obtained in this manner must be disclosed to both Parties and shall be open for comments. Interested parties shall be authorised to submit amicus curiae briefs to the arbitration panel under the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure referred to in Article 18.\nArticle 13\nInterpretation principles\nArbitration panels shall apply and interpret the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. They shall not give an interpretation of the acquis communautaire. The fact that a provision is identical in substance to a provision of the Treaty establishing the European Communities shall not be decisive in the interpretation of that provision.\nArticle 14\nArbitration panel decisions and rulings\n1.   All decisions of the arbitration panel, including the adoption of the ruling, shall be taken by majority vote.\n2.   All rulings of the arbitration panel shall be binding on the Parties. They shall be notified to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, which shall make them publicly available unless it decides by consensus not to do so.\nCHAPTER III\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 15\nList of arbitrators\n1.
