It called on the Member States to concentrate their efforts on detecting and dismantling criminal networks while protecting the rights of victims.\n(3)\nAn indication of the growing concern about this phenomenon at international level was the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, supplemented by a Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, and a Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. These were signed by the Community and the 15 Member States in December 2000.\n(4)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the protection granted to refugees, to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection and persons seeking international protection under international refugee law and without prejudice to other human rights instruments.\n(5)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to other provisions on the protection of victims, witnesses or persons who are particularly vulnerable. Nor does it detract from the prerogatives of the Member States as regards the right of residence granted on humanitarian or other grounds.\n(6)\nThis Directive respects fundamental rights and complies with the principles recognised for example by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(7)\nMember States should give effect to the provision of this Directive without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic characteristics, language, religion or belief, political or other opinions, membership of a national minority, fortune, birth, disabilities, age or sexual orientation.\n(8)\nAt European level, Council Directive 2002/90/EC of 28 November 2002 defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence (4) and Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings (5) were adopted to strengthen the prevention and the fight against the above offences.\n(9)\nThis Directive introduces a residence permit intended for victims of trafficking in human beings or, if a Member State decides to extend the scope of this Directive, to third-country nationals who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration to whom the residence permit offers a sufficient incentive to cooperate with the competent authorities while including certain conditions to safeguard against abuse.\n(10)\nTo this end, it is necessary to lay down the criteria for issuing a residence permit, the conditions of stay and the grounds for non-renewal and withdrawal. The right to stay under this Directive is subject to conditions and is of provisional nature.\n(11)\nThe third country nationals concerned should be informed of the possibility of obtaining this residence permit and be given a period in which to reflect on their position. This should help put them in a position to reach a well-informed decision as to whether or not to cooperate with the competent authorities, which may be the police, prosecution and judicial authorities (in view of the risks this may entail), so that they cooperate freely and hence more effectively.\n(12)\nGiven their vulnerability, the third-country nationals concerned should be granted the assistance provided by this Directive. This assistance should allow them to recover and escape the influence of the perpetrators of the offences. The medical treatment to be provided to the third-country nationals covered by this Directive also includes, where appropriate, psychotherapeutical care.\n(13)\nA decision on the issue of a residence permit for at least six months or its renewal has to be taken by the competent authorities, who should consider if the relevant conditions are fulfilled.\n(14)\nThis Directive should apply without prejudice to the activities carried out by the competent authorities in all phases of the relevant national proceedings, and in particular when investigating the offences concerned.\n(15)\nMember States should consider authorising the stay on other grounds, according to their national legislation, for third-country nationals who may fall within the scope of this Directive, but who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions set by it, for the members of his/her family or for persons treated as members of his/her family.\n(16)\nTo enable the third-country nationals concerned to gain their independence and not return to the criminal network, the holders of the residence permit should be authorised, under the conditions set by this Directive, to have access to the labour market and pursue vocational training and education. In authorising access of the holders of the residence permit to vocational training and education, Member States should consider in particular the likely duration of stay.\n(17)\nThe participation of the third-country nationals concerned to programmes and schemes, already existing or to be introduced, should contribute to their recovery of a normal social life.\n(18)\nIf the third-country nationals concerned submit an application for another kind of residence permit, Member States take a decision on the basis of ordinary national aliens' law. When examining such an application, Member States should consider the fact that the third-country nationals concerned have been granted the residence permit issued under this Directive.\n(19)\nMember States should provide the Commission, with respect to the implementation of this Directive, with the information which has been identified in the framework of the activities developed with regard to the collection and treatment of statistical data concerning matters falling within the area of Justice and Home Affairs.\n(20)\nSince the objective of introducing a residence permit for the third-country nationals concerned who cooperate in the fight against trafficking in human beings cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at the Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(21)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, these Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(22)\nIn accordance with Article 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Directive and is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Directive is to define the conditions for granting residence permits of limited duration, linked to the length of the relevant national proceedings, to third-country nationals who cooperate in the fight against trafficking in human beings or against action to facilitate illegal immigration.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\n‘third-country national’ means any person who is not a citizen of the Union within the meaning of Article 17(1) of the Treaty;\n(b)\n‘action to facilitate illegal immigration’ covers cases such as those referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 2002/90/EC;\n(c)\n‘trafficking in human beings’ covers cases such as those referred to in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA;\n(d)\n‘measure to enforce an expulsion order’ means any measure taken by a Member State to enforce the decision of the competent authorities ordering the expulsion of a third-country national;\n(e)\n‘residence permit’ means any authorisation issued by a Member State, allowing a third-country national who fulfils the conditions set by this Directive to stay legally on its territory.\n(f)\n‘unaccompanied minors’ means third-country nationals below the age of eighteen, who arrive on the territory of the Member State unaccompanied by an adult responsible for them whether by law or custom, and for as long as they are not effectively taken into the care of such a person, or minors who are left unaccompanied after they have entered the territory of the Member State.\nArticle 3\nScope\n1.   Member States shall apply this Directive to the third-country nationals who are, or have been victims of offences related to the trafficking in human beings, even if they have illegally entered the territory of the Member States.\n2.   Member States may apply this Directive to the third-country nationals who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration.\n3.

Member States shall ensure that the third-country nationals concerned are granted a reflection period allowing them to recover and escape the influence of the perpetrators of the offences so that they can take an informed decision as to whether to cooperate with the competent authorities.\nThe duration and starting point of the period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be determined according to national law.\n2.   During the reflection period and while awaiting the decision of the competent authorities, the third-country nationals concerned shall have access to the treatment referred to in Article 7 and it shall not be possible to enforce any expulsion order against them.\n3.   The reflection period shall not create any entitlement to residence under this Directive.\n4.   The Member State may at any time terminate the reflection period if the competent authorities have established that the person concerned has actively, voluntarily and on his/her own initiative renewed contact with the perpetrators of the offences referred to in Article 2(b) and (c) or for reasons relating to public policy and to the protection of national security.\nArticle 7\nTreatment granted before the issue of the residence permit\n1.

After the expiry of the reflection period, or earlier if the competent authorities are of the view that the third-country national concerned has already fulfilled the criterion set out in subparagraph (b), Member States shall consider:\n(a)\nthe opportunity presented by prolonging his/her stay on its territory for the investigations or the judicial proceedings, and\n(b)\nwhether he/she has shown a clear intention to cooperate and\n(c)\nwhether he/she has severed all relations with those suspected of acts that might be included among the offences referred to in Article 2(b) and (c).\n2.   For the issue of the residence permit and without prejudice to the reasons relating to public policy and to the protection of national security, the fulfilment of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be required.\n3.   Without prejudice to the provisions on withdrawal referred to in Article 14, the residence permit shall be valid for at least six months. It shall be renewed if the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of this Article continue to be satisfied.\nCHAPTER III\nTREATMENT OF HOLDERS OF THE RESIDENCE PERMIT\nArticle 9\nTreatment granted after the issue of the residence permit\n1.   Member States shall ensure that holders of a residence permit who do not have sufficient resources are granted at least the same treatment provided for in Article 7.\n2.   Member States shall provide necessary medical or other assistance to the third-country nationals concerned, who do not have sufficient resources and have special needs, such as pregnant women, the disabled or victims of sexual violence or other forms of violence and, if Member States have recourse to the option provided for in Article 3(3), minors.\nArticle 10\nMinors\nIf Member States have recourse to the option provided for in Article 3(3), the following provisions shall apply:\n(a)\nMember States shall take due account of the best interests of the child when applying this Directive. They shall ensure that the procedure is appropriate to the age and maturity of the child. In particular, if they consider that it is in the best interest of the child, they may extend the reflection period.\n(b)\nMember States shall ensure that minors have access to the educational system under the same conditions as nationals.

Member States shall define the rules under which holders of the residence permit shall be authorised to have access to the labour market, to vocational training and education.\nSuch access shall be limited to the duration of the residence permit.\n2.   The conditions and the procedures for authorising access to the labour market, to vocational training and education shall be determined, under the national legislation, by the competent authorities.\nArticle 12\nProgrammes or schemes for the third-country nationals concerned\n1.

It is hoped that this will encourage them to cooperate with the competent authorities whilst providing them with adequate protection.\nACT\n                  \nCouncil Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities.\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?\n                     \nThe directive sets out the procedure for issuing and renewing the residence permit and the conditions for non-renewal or withdrawal, as well as the treatment of victims prior to and after being granted a permit.\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nThe directive applies to non-EU nationals regardless of whether they have entered the EU illegally. Permits can be granted to those who have reached the age of majority in the respective EU country and may apply to children under the conditions set out in national laws.\nPersons concerned must be informed of the possibilities offered under this directive by the competent authorities of the relevant EU country. Non-EU nationals are granted a reflection period to recover and to escape the influence of the perpetrators of the offences. This allows them to make an informed decision on whether to cooperate with the investigating authorities. During this period, the non-EU nationals concerned should:\nnot be made subject to any expulsion order;\nif required, be provided with help to ensure they have adequate living standards and with access to emergency medical and, if appropriate, psychological treatment;\nhave access to translation and interpreting services, where appropriate;\nhave access to free legal aid, if provided for in national law.\nThe competent authorities are responsible for assessing whether the:\npresence of the victim can help the investigation;\nvictim has shown a clear intention to cooperate;\nvictim cut all contact with those suspected of the given offences.\nWhen the above three conditions have been fulfilled, a temporary renewable residence permit, valid for at least 6 months, will be issued. The permit can be renewed if the relevant conditions continue to be satisfied. The permit grants the holder access to the labour market and to vocational training and education, under conditions determined in national legislation.\nThe residence permit may not be renewed if the conditions of this directive are no longer met or if the relevant proceedings have been terminated. The permit may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including if the victim renews contact with those suspected of committing the offences or ceases to cooperate or when the proceedings are discontinued.\nEU countries are free to adopt or maintain more favourable provisions for the persons covered by this directive.\nWhile the collection of data on various aspects of this directive still needs to be improved, two reports from the Commission on the application of the directive in 2010 and in 2014 have found that the possibility to issue permits in exchange for cooperation with authorities might be under-utilised by EU countries.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nThis directive must be read in conjunction with Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims. The latter provides a horizontal legal framework for both EU and non-EU citizens and has reinforced most provisions of Council Directive 2004/81/EC, including the protection and assistance framework for children.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nCouncil Directive 2004/81/EC\n6.8.2004\n5.8.2006\nOJ L 261, 6.8.2004, pp. 19-23\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Directive 2004/81 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities (COM(2010) 493 final of 15.10.2010).\nCommunication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of Directive 2004/81 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities (COM(2014) 635 final of 17.10.2014).\nlast update 02.04.2015", "tags": ["illegal migration", "access to education", "job access", "foreign national", "residence permit", "administrative formalities", "EU visa policy", "health care", "trafficking in human beings", "help for victims"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
