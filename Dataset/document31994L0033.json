{"celex_id": "31994L0033", "reference": "20.8.1994\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 216/12\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 94/33/EC\nof 22 June 1994\non the protection of young people at work\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 118a thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements to encourage improvements, especially in the working environment, as regards the health and safety of workers;\nWhereas, under that Article, such directives must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;\nWhereas points 20 and 22 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, adopted by the European Council in Strasbourg on 9 December 1989, state that:\n‘20.\nWithout prejudice to such rules as may be more favourable to young people, in particular those ensuring their preparation for work through vocational training, and subject to derogations limited to certain light work, the minimum employment age must not be lower than the minimum school-leaving age and, in any case, not lower than 15 years;\n22.\nAppropriate measures must be taken to adjust labour regulations applicable to young workers so that their specific development and vocational training and access to employment needs are met.The duration of work must, in particular, be limited — without it being possible to circumvent this limitation through recourse to overtime — and night work prohibited in the case of workers of under eighteen years of age, save in the case of certain jobs laid down in national legislation or regulations.’;\nWhereas account should be taken of the principles of the International Labour Organization regarding the protection of young people at work, including those relating to the minimum age for access to employment or work;\nWhereas, in this Resolution on child labour (4), the European Parliament summarized the various aspects of work by young people and stressed its effects on their health, safety and physical and intellectual development, and pointed to the need to adopt a Directive harmonizing national legislation in the field;\nWhereas Article 15 of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5) provides that particularly sensitive risk groups must be protected against the dangers which specifically affect them;\nWhereas children and adolescents must be considered specific risk groups, and measures must be taken with regard to their safety and health;\nWhereas the vulnerability of children calls for Member States to prohibit their employment and ensure that the minimum working or employment age is not lower than the minimum age at which compulsory schooling as imposed by national law ends or 15 years in any event; whereas derogations from the prohibition on child labour may be admitted only in special cases and under the conditions stipulated in this Directive; whereas, under no circumstances, may such derogations be detrimental to regular school attendance or prevent children benefiting fully from their education;\nWhereas, in view of the nature of the transition from childhood to adult life, work by adolescents should be strictly regulated and protected;\nWhereas every employer should guarantee young people working conditions appropriate to their age;\nWhereas employers should implement the measures necessary to protect the safety and health of young people on the basis on an assessment of work-related hazards to the young;\nWhereas Member States should protect young people against any specific risks arising from their lack of experience, absence of awareness of existing or potential risks, or from their immaturity;\nWhereas Member States should therefore prohibit the employment of young people for the work specified by this Directive;\nWhereas the adoption of specific minimal requirements in respect of the organization of working time is likely to improve working conditions for young people;\nWhereas the maximum working time of young people should be strictly limited and night work by young people should be prohibited, with the exception of certain jobs specified by national legislation or rules;\nWhereas Member States should take the appropriate measures to ensure that the working time of adolescents receiving school education does not adversely affect their ability to benefit from that education;\nWhereas time spent on training by young persons working under a theoretical and/or practical combined work/training scheme or an in-plant work-experience should be counted as working time;\nWhereas, in order to ensure the safety and health of young people, the latter should be granted minimum daily, weekly and annual periods of rest and adequate breaks;\nWhereas, with respect to the weekly rest period, due account should be taken of the diversity of cultural, ethnic, religious and other factors prevailing in the Member States; whereas in particular, it is ultimately for each Member State to decide whether Sunday should be included in the weekly rest period, and if so to what extent;\nWhereas appropriate work experience may contribute to the aim of preparing young people for adult working and social life, provided it is ensured that any harm to their safety, health and development is avoided;\nWhereas, although derogations from the bans and limitations imposed by this Directive would appear indispensable for certain activities or particular situations, applications thereof must not prejudice the principles underlying the established protection system;\nWhereas this Directive constitutes a tangible step towards developing the social dimension of the internal market;\nWhereas the application in practice of the system of protection laid down by this Directive will require that Member States implement a system of effective and proportionate measures;\nWhereas the implementation of some provisions of this Directive poses particular problems for one Member State with regard to its system of protection for young people at work; whereas that Member State should therefore be allowed to refrain from implementing the relevant provisions for a suitable period,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nSECTION I\nArticle 1\nPurpose\n1.

The Member States which have a specific authorization system for modelling agencies with regard to the activities of children may retain that system.\nSECTION II\nArticle 6\nGeneral obligations on employers\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 4 (1), the employer shall adopt the measures necessary to protect the safety and health of young people, taking particular account of the specific risks referred to in Article 7 (1).\n2.

In addition, Directive 2014/27/EU replaces references to repealed Directives (90/679/EEC and 90/394/EEC) which are replaced with references to relevant provisions of Directive 2000/54/EC and Directive 2004/37/EC.\nDirective 94/33/EC contains provisions relating to working hours, night work, rest periods, annual leave and rest breaks.\nEach EU country is responsible for defining the measures to be taken in the event of infringement of the provisions of this directive. These measures must be effective and proportionate to the offence.\nThe directive contains a non-regression clause concerning the level of protection for young people.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 9 September 1994.
