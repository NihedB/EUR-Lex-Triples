The new task has been assigned to it in response to the 2008 crisis in order to ensure European banking supervision is less dependent on national considerations (for further details, refer to EU legislation establishing a ‘single supervisory mechanism’).\nThis is key for the legitimacy of its supervisory role. It is the first time substantial powers to supervise banks have been transferred from national to European level. Decisions can be very sensitive since they assess banks’ financial health. For instance, the ECB can require a bank to hold more capital.\nBy contrast, the ECB remains fully independent when exercising its initial role of being responsible for monetary policy in the Eurozone. Here, the main objective is to ensure price stability.\nThe practicalities governing the democratic oversight of the ECB’s new supervisory task by the EP are set out in an interinstitutional agreement reached between both institutions in 2013. The key elements are:\n1.\nHearings and discussions\nThe ECB has to appear regularly at public hearings before the EP. Both institutions can hold oral discussions behind closed doors. In this case, the participants are subject to confidentiality requirements. The ECB has to submit a report on the execution of its new supervisory task to the EP every year.\n2.\nAccess to information\nThe ECB provides the EP with a comprehensive and meaningful record of discussions at meetings of the ECB’s supervisory board.\n3.\nInvestigation\nThe EP can launch investigations into possible mistakes by the ECB when exercising its supervisory task. In that situation, the ECB has to cooperate fully with the EP.\n4.\nAppointments\nThe EP is involved in the appointments of the Chair and the Vice-Chair of the ECB’s supervisory board.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nInterinstitutional Agreement 2013/694/EU\n-\n-\nOJ L 320 of 30.11.2013\nRELATED ACT\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions (OJ L 287, 29.10.2013).\nLast updated: 15.06.2014", "tags": ["credit institution", "access to EU information", "closing of accounts", "exchange of information", "confidentiality"], "subjects": ["Freedom of establishment", "European Central Bank (ECB)", "European Central Bank (ECB)"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32013Q1130(01)_p1": {"text": "(3)  directive 2013/36/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending directive 2002/87/ec and repealing directive 2006/48/ec directive 2006/49/ec (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338).", "triples": [" directive 2013/36/eu,  amending,  directive 2002/87/ec", " directive 2013/36/eu,  repealing,  directive 2006/48/ec", " directive 2013/36/eu,  repealing,  directive 2006/49/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
