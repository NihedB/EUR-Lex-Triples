The details of each contact point must be sent to the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU, which then forwards the information to the national contact points in other EU countries.\nNational contact points provide each other with information relevant to investigations into genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes upon request from other national contact points.\nThe Council of the EU annually briefs the European Parliament on the activities of the network of contact points.\nThe network meets twice a year at meetings convened by the Presidency of the Council of the EU to coordinate on-going efforts to investigate and prosecute persons suspected of having committed or participated in genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt entered into force on 13 June 2002.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nAll EU countries ratified the Rome Statute of 17 July 1998 setting up the International Criminal Court (ICC) to hear cases involving genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nHowever, the investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are primarily the responsibilities of national authorities. This is why closer cooperation between national authorities is needed to ensure these crimes are combated successfully.\nGenocide Network\nKEY TERMS\n* Genocide: acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.\n* Crimes against humanity: acts committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against civilian populations.\n* War crimes: acts committed that violate the law of war (e.g. the Geneva Conventions).
