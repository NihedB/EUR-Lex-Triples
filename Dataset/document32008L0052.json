To that end, the Community has to adopt, inter alia, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters that are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(2)\nThe principle of access to justice is fundamental and, with a view to facilitating better access to justice, the European Council at its meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 called for alternative, extra-judicial procedures to be created by the Member States.\n(3)\nIn May 2000 the Council adopted Conclusions on alternative methods of settling disputes under civil and commercial law, stating that the establishment of basic principles in this area is an essential step towards enabling the appropriate development and operation of extrajudicial procedures for the settlement of disputes in civil and commercial matters so as to simplify and improve access to justice.\n(4)\nIn April 2002 the Commission presented a Green Paper on alternative dispute resolution in civil and commercial law, taking stock of the existing situation as concerns alternative dispute resolution methods in the European Union and initiating widespread consultations with Member States and interested parties on possible measures to promote the use of mediation.\n(5)\nThe objective of securing better access to justice, as part of the policy of the European Union to establish an area of freedom, security and justice, should encompass access to judicial as well as extrajudicial dispute resolution methods. This Directive should contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular as concerns the availability of mediation services.\n(6)\nMediation can provide a cost-effective and quick extrajudicial resolution of disputes in civil and commercial matters through processes tailored to the needs of the parties. Agreements resulting from mediation are more likely to be complied with voluntarily and are more likely to preserve an amicable and sustainable relationship between the parties. These benefits become even more pronounced in situations displaying cross-border elements.\n(7)\nIn order to promote further the use of mediation and ensure that parties having recourse to mediation can rely on a predictable legal framework, it is necessary to introduce framework legislation addressing, in particular, key aspects of civil procedure.\n(8)\nThe provisions of this Directive should apply only to mediation in cross-border disputes, but nothing should prevent Member States from applying such provisions also to internal mediation processes.\n(9)\nThis Directive should not in any way prevent the use of modern communication technologies in the mediation process.\n(10)\nThis Directive should apply to processes whereby two or more parties to a cross-border dispute attempt by themselves, on a voluntary basis, to reach an amicable agreement on the settlement of their dispute with the assistance of a mediator. It should apply in civil and commercial matters. However, it should not apply to rights and obligations on which the parties are not free to decide themselves under the relevant applicable law. Such rights and obligations are particularly frequent in family law and employment law.\n(11)\nThis Directive should not apply to pre-contractual negotiations or to processes of an adjudicatory nature such as certain judicial conciliation schemes, consumer complaint schemes, arbitration and expert determination or to processes administered by persons or bodies issuing a formal recommendation, whether or not it be legally binding as to the resolution of the dispute.\n(12)\nThis Directive should apply to cases where a court refers parties to mediation or in which national law prescribes mediation. Furthermore, in so far as a judge may act as a mediator under national law, this Directive should also apply to mediation conducted by a judge who is not responsible for any judicial proceedings relating to the matter or matters in dispute. This Directive should not, however, extend to attempts made by the court or judge seised to settle a dispute in the context of judicial proceedings concerning the dispute in question or to cases in which the court or judge seised requests assistance or advice from a competent person.\n(13)\nThe mediation provided for in this Directive should be a voluntary process in the sense that the parties are themselves in charge of the process and may organise it as they wish and terminate it at any time. However, it should be possible under national law for the courts to set time-limits for a mediation process. Moreover, the courts should be able to draw the partiesâ€™ attention to the possibility of mediation whenever this is appropriate.\n(14)\nNothing in this Directive should prejudice national legislation making the use of mediation compulsory or subject to incentives or sanctions provided that such legislation does not prevent parties from exercising their right of access to the judicial system. Nor should anything in this Directive prejudice existing self-regulating mediation systems in so far as these deal with aspects which are not covered by this Directive.\n(15)\nIn order to provide legal certainty, this Directive should indicate which date should be relevant for determining whether or not a dispute which the parties attempt to settle through mediation is a cross-border dispute. In the absence of a written agreement, the parties should be deemed to agree to use mediation at the point in time when they take specific action to start the mediation process.\n(16)\nTo ensure the necessary mutual trust with respect to confidentiality, effect on limitation and prescription periods, and recognition and enforcement of agreements resulting from mediation, Member States should encourage, by any means they consider appropriate, the training of mediators and the introduction of effective quality control mechanisms concerning the provision of mediation services.\n(17)\nMember States should define such mechanisms, which may include having recourse to market-based solutions, and should not be required to provide any funding in that respect. The mechanisms should aim at preserving the flexibility of the mediation process and the autonomy of the parties, and at ensuring that mediation is conducted in an effective, impartial and competent way. Mediators should be made aware of the existence of the European Code of Conduct for Mediators which should also be made available to the general public on the Internet.\n(18)\nIn the field of consumer protection, the Commission has adopted a Recommendation (3) establishing minimum quality criteria which out-of-court bodies involved in the consensual resolution of consumer disputes should offer to their users. Any mediators or organisations coming within the scope of that Recommendation should be encouraged to respect its principles. In order to facilitate the dissemination of information concerning such bodies, the Commission should set up a database of out-of-court schemes which Member States consider as respecting the principles of that Recommendation.\n(19)\nMediation should not be regarded as a poorer alternative to judicial proceedings in the sense that compliance with agreements resulting from mediation would depend on the good will of the parties. Member States should therefore ensure that the parties to a written agreement resulting from mediation can have the content of their agreement made enforceable. It should only be possible for a Member State to refuse to make an agreement enforceable if the content is contrary to its law, including its private international law, or if its law does not provide for the enforceability of the content of the specific agreement. This could be the case if the obligation specified in the agreement was by its nature unenforceable.\n(20)\nThe content of an agreement resulting from mediation which has been made enforceable in a Member State should be recognised and declared enforceable in the other Member States in accordance with applicable Community or national law. This could, for example, be on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (4) or Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (5).\n(21)\nRegulation (EC) No 2201/2003 specifically provides that, in order to be enforceable in another Member State, agreements between the parties have to be enforceable in the Member State in which they were concluded. Consequently, if the content of an agreement resulting from mediation in a family law matter is not enforceable in the Member State where the agreement was concluded and where the request for enforceability is made, this Directive should not encourage the parties to circumvent the law of that Member State by having their agreement made enforceable in another Member State.\n(22)\nThis Directive should not affect the rules in the Member States concerning enforcement of agreements resulting from mediation.\n(23)\nConfidentiality in the mediation process is important and this Directive should therefore provide for a minimum degree of compatibility of civil procedural rules with regard to how to protect the confidentiality of mediation in any subsequent civil and commercial judicial proceedings or arbitration.\n(24)\nIn order to encourage the parties to use mediation, Member States should ensure that their rules on limitation and prescription periods do not prevent the parties from going to court or to arbitration if their mediation attempt fails. Member States should make sure that this result is achieved even though this Directive does not harmonise national rules on limitation and prescription periods. Provisions on limitation and prescription periods in international agreements as implemented in the Member States, for instance in the area of transport law, should not be affected by this Directive.\n(25)\nMember States should encourage the provision of information to the general public on how to contact mediators and organisations providing mediation services. They should also encourage legal practitioners to inform their clients of the possibility of mediation.\n(26)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (6), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(27)\nThis Directive seeks to promote the fundamental rights, and takes into account the principles, recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(28)\nSince the objective of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(29)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom and Ireland have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Directive.\n(30)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Directive and is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nObjective and scope\n1.   The objective of this Directive is to facilitate access to alternative dispute resolution and to promote the amicable settlement of disputes by encouraging the use of mediation and by ensuring a balanced relationship between mediation and judicial proceedings.\n2.   This Directive shall apply, in cross-border disputes, to civil and commercial matters except as regards rights and obligations which are not at the partiesâ€™ disposal under the relevant applicable law. It shall not extend, in particular, to revenue, customs or administrative matters or to the liability of the State for acts and omissions in the exercise of State authority (acta iure imperii).\n3.   In this Directive, the term â€˜Member Stateâ€™ shall mean Member States with the exception of Denmark.\nArticle 2\nCross-border disputes\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive a cross-border dispute shall be one in which at least one of the parties is domiciled or habitually resident in a Member State other than that of any other party on the date on which:\n(a)\nthe parties agree to use mediation after the dispute has arisen;\n(b)\nmediation is ordered by a court;\n(c)\nan obligation to use mediation arises under national law; or\n(d)\nfor the purposes of Article 5 an invitation is made to the parties.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, for the purposes of Articles 7 and 8 a cross-border dispute shall also be one in which judicial proceedings or arbitration following mediation between the parties are initiated in a Member State other than that in which the parties were domiciled or habitually resident on the date referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c).\n3.   For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, domicile shall be determined in accordance with Articles 59 and 60 of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\nâ€˜Mediationâ€™ means a structured process, however named or referred to, whereby two or more parties to a dispute attempt by themselves, on a voluntary basis, to reach an agreement on the settlement of their dispute with the assistance of a mediator. This process may be initiated by the parties or suggested or ordered by a court or prescribed by the law of a Member State.\nIt includes mediation conducted by a judge who is not responsible for any judicial proceedings concerning the dispute in question. It excludes attempts made by the court or the judge seised to settle a dispute in the course of judicial proceedings concerning the dispute in question.\n(b)\nâ€˜Mediatorâ€™ means any third person who is asked to conduct a mediation in an effective, impartial and competent way, regardless of the denomination or profession of that third person in the Member State concerned and of the way in which the third person has been appointed or requested to conduct the mediation.\nArticle 4\nEnsuring the quality of mediation\n1.   Member States shall encourage, by any means which they consider appropriate, the development of, and adherence to, voluntary codes of conduct by mediators and organisations providing mediation services, as well as other effective quality control mechanisms concerning the provision of mediation services.\n2.   Member States shall encourage the initial and further training of mediators in order to ensure that the mediation is conducted in an effective, impartial and competent way in relation to the parties.\nArticle 5\nRecourse to mediation\n1.   A court before which an action is brought may, when appropriate and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, invite the parties to use mediation in order to settle the dispute. The court may also invite the parties to attend an information session on the use of mediation if such sessions are held and are easily available.\n2.   This Directive is without prejudice to national legislation making the use of mediation compulsory or subject to incentives or sanctions, whether before or after judicial proceedings have started, provided that such legislation does not prevent the parties from exercising their right of access to the judicial system.\nArticle 6\nEnforceability of agreements resulting from mediation\n1.   Member States shall ensure that it is possible for the parties, or for one of them with the explicit consent of the others, to request that the content of a written agreement resulting from mediation be made enforceable. The content of such an agreement shall be made enforceable unless, in the case in question, either the content of that agreement is contrary to the law of the Member State where the request is made or the law of that Member State does not provide for its enforceability.\n2.   The content of the agreement may be made enforceable by a court or other competent authority in a judgment or decision or in an authentic instrument in accordance with the law of the Member State where the request is made.\n3.   Member States shall inform the Commission of the courts or other authorities competent to receive requests in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.   Nothing in this Article shall affect the rules applicable to the recognition and enforcement in another Member State of an agreement made enforceable in accordance with paragraph 1.\nArticle 7\nConfidentiality of mediation\n1.   Given that mediation is intended to take place in a manner which respects confidentiality, Member States shall ensure that, unless the parties agree otherwise, neither mediators nor those involved in the administration of the mediation process shall be compelled to give evidence in civil and commercial judicial proceedings or arbitration regarding information arising out of or in connection with a mediation process, except:\n(a)\nwhere this is necessary for overriding considerations of public policy of the Member State concerned, in particular when required to ensure the protection of the best interests of children or to prevent harm to the physical or psychological integrity of a person; or\n(b)\nwhere disclosure of the content of the agreement resulting from mediation is necessary in order to implement or enforce that agreement.\n2.   Nothing in paragraph 1 shall preclude Member States from enacting stricter measures to protect the confidentiality of mediation.\nArticle 8\nEffect of mediation on limitation and prescription periods\n1.   Member States shall ensure that parties who choose mediation in an attempt to settle a dispute are not subsequently prevented from initiating judicial proceedings or arbitration in relation to that dispute by the expiry of limitation or prescription periods during the mediation process.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to provisions on limitation or prescription periods in international agreements to which Member States are party.\nArticle 9\nInformation for the general public\nMember States shall encourage, by any means which they consider appropriate, the availability to the general public, in particular on the Internet, of information on how to contact mediators and organisations providing mediation services.\nArticle 10\nInformation on competent courts and authorities\nThe Commission shall make publicly available, by any appropriate means, information on the competent courts or authorities communicated by the Member States pursuant to Article 6(3).\nArticle 11\nReview\nNot later than 21 May 2016, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee a report on the application of this Directive. The report shall consider the development of mediation throughout the European Union and the impact of this Directive in the Member States. If necessary, the report shall be accompanied by proposals to adapt this Directive.\nArticle 12\nTransposition\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 21 May 2011, with the exception of Article 10, for which the date of compliance shall be 21 November 2010 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen they are adopted by Member States, these measures shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.\n2.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\nArticle 13\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 14\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 21 May 2008.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

It seeks to ensure a balanced relationship between mediation and judicial proceedings.\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nThe directive applies to cross-border disputes in civil and commercial matters. It does not extend to:\nrevenue, customs or administrative matters;\nthe liability of an EU country for acts and omissions in the exercise of State authority;\ndisputes where one or more parties is domiciled or resident in Denmark.\nEU countries must establish a procedure allowing parties to request the confirmation of an agreement. This confirmation can be by a judgment, decision or authentic act of a court or public authority. It will allow the mutual recognition and enforcement of an agreement throughout the EU under the same conditions as those established for court decisions in civil and commercial matters and in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility.\nMediators* or those involved in the mediation process are not obliged to give evidence in judicial proceedings regarding information obtained during that process, except if:\nnecessary for overriding considerations of public policy, particularly to protect the physical integrity of a person;\ndisclosure of the content of the agreement is necessary to implement or enforce that agreement.\nEU countries must encourage the training of mediators as well as the development and application of voluntary codes of conduct for the profession.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nIn 2013 the EU published 2 new pieces of legislation on alternative dispute resolution:\nDirective 2013/11/EU on alternative dispute resolution which ensures that consumers have access to quality alternative dispute resolution (ADR) entities for all kinds of contractual disputes with traders. To ensure such access, EU countries must establish national ADR infrastructures by January 2016. Mediation is one out of several forms of ADR on which EU countries can rely for establishing that infrastructure;\nRegulation (EU) No 524/2013 on online dispute resolution (ODR), under which an EU-wide online platform will be set up for disputes that arise from online transactions. The platform will allow consumers to submit their disputes online and will operate in all EU official languages. It is scheduled to be accessible as of January 2016.\nFor more information see the Alternative and Online Dispute Resolution (ADR/ODR) on the European Commissionâ€™s website.\nKEYWORDS\n* Mediation: a structured process in which 2 or more parties to a dispute attempt by themselves, on a voluntary basis, to reach an agreement on the settlement of their dispute with the assistance of a mediator. It may be initiated by the parties or suggested or ordered by a court or prescribed by the law of an EU country.\n* Mediator: a third person who is asked to conduct mediation in an effective, impartial and competent way. The status or occupation of this person in the EU country concerned is not relevant, nor is the way in which the third person has been appointed or requested to conduct the mediation.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDate of transposition in the Member State\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2008/52/EC\n13.6.2008\n21.5.2011 (Article 10: 21.11.2010)\nOJ L 136 of 24.5.2008, pp. 3-8\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nDirective 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (Directive on consumer ADR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 63-79)\nRegulation (EU) No 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (Regulation on consumer ODR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 1-12)\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Towards a European Horizontal Framework for Collective Redress (COM(2013) 401 final of 11.6.2013)\nlast update 17.08.2015", "tags": ["mediator", "judicial cooperation", "cross-border cooperation", "civil procedure", "dissemination of information", "civil law", "commercial law", "access to the courts", "civil proceedings", "trade dispute"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32008L0052_p1": {"text": "directive 2013/11/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending regulation 2006/2004 and directive 2009/22/ec (Directive on consumer ADR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 63-79)", "triples": [" directive 2013/11/eu,  amending,  regulation 2006/2004", " directive 2013/11/eu,  amending,  directive 2009/22/ec"]}, "32008L0052_p2": {"text": "regulation 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending regulation 2006/2004 and directive 2009/22/ec (Regulation on consumer ODR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 1-12)", "triples": [" regulation 524/2013,  amending,  regulation 2006/2004", " regulation 524/2013,  amending,  directive 2009/22/ec"]}}}
