whereas provisions on continuity of contracts, the replacement of references to the ecu in legal instruments by references to the euro and rounding have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (4); whereas the introduction of the euro concerns day-to-day operations of the whole population in participating Member States; whereas measures other than those in this Regulation and in Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 should be examined to ensure a balanced changeover, in particular for consumers;(2) Whereas, at the meeting of the European Council in Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995, the decision was taken that the term 'ecu` used by the Treaty to refer to the European currency unit is a generic term; whereas the Governments of the 15 Member States have reached the common agreement that this decision is the agreed and definitive interpretation of the relevant Treaty provisions; whereas the name given to the European currency shall be the 'euro`; whereas the euro as the currency of the participating Member States shall be divided into one hundred sub-units with the name 'cent`; whereas the definition of the name 'cent` does not prevent the use of variants of this term in common usage in the Member States; whereas the European Council furthermore considered that the name of the single currency must be the same in all the official languages of the European Union, taking into account the existence of different alphabets;(3) Whereas the Council when acting in accordance with the third sentence of Article 109l(4) of the Treaty shall take the measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the euro other than the adoption of the conversion rates;(4) Whereas whenever under Article 109k(2) of the Treaty a Member State becomes a participating Member State, the Council shall according to Article 109l(5) of the Treaty take the other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the euro as the single currency of this Member State;(5) Whereas according to the first sentence of Article 109l(4) of the Treaty the Council shall at the starting date of the third stage adopt the conversion rates at which the currencies of the participating Member States shall be irrevocably fixed and at which irrevocably fixed rate the euro shall be substituted for these currencies;(6) Whereas given the absence of exchange rate risk either between the euro unit and the national currency units or between these national currency units, legislative provisions should be interpreted accordingly;(7) Whereas the term 'contract` used for the definition of legal instruments is meant to include all types of contracts, irrespective of the way in which they are concluded;(8) Whereas in order to prepare a smooth changeover to the euro a transitional period is needed between the substitution of the euro for the currencies of the participating Member States and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins; whereas during this period the national currency units will be defined as sub-divisions of the euro; whereas thereby a legal equivalence is established between the euro unit and the national currency units;(9) Whereas in accordance with Article 109g of the Treaty and with Regulation (EC) No 1103/97, the euro will replace the ECU as from 1 January 1999 as the unit of account of the institutions of the European Communities; whereas the euro should also be the unit of account of the European Central Bank (ECB) and of the central banks of the participating Member States; whereas, in line with the Madrid conclusions, monetary policy operations will be carried out in the euro unit by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB); whereas this does not prevent national central banks from keeping accounts in their national currency unit during the transitional period, in particular for their staff and for public administrations;(10) Whereas each participating Member State may allow the full use of the euro unit in its territory during the transitional period;(11) Whereas during the transitional period contracts, national laws and other legal instruments can be drawn up validly in the euro unit or in the national currency unit; whereas during this period, nothing in this Regulation should affect the validity of any reference to a national currency unit in any legal instrument;(12) Whereas, unless agreed otherwise, economic agents have to respect the denomination of a legal instrument in the performance of all acts to be carried out under that instrument;(13) Whereas the euro unit and the national currency units are units of the same currency; whereas it should be ensured that payments inside a participating Member State by crediting an account can be made either in the euro unit or the respective national currency unit; whereas the provisions on payments by crediting an account should also apply to those cross-border payments, which are denominated in the euro unit or the national currency unit of the account of the creditor; whereas it is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of payment systems by laying down provisions dealing with the crediting of accounts by payment instruments credited through those systems; whereas the provisions on payments by crediting an account should not imply that financial intermediaries are obliged to make available either other payment facilities or products denominated in any particular unit of the euro; whereas the provisions on payments by crediting an account do not prohibit financial intermediaries from coordinating the introduction of payment facilities denominated in the euro unit which rely on a common technical infrastructure during the transitional period;(14) Whereas in accordance with the conclusions reached by the European Council at its meeting held in Madrid, new tradeable public debt will be issued in the euro unit by the participating Member States as from 1 January 1999; whereas it is desirable to allow issuers of debt to redenominate outstanding debt in the euro unit; whereas the provisions on redenomination should be such that they can also be applied in the jurisdictions of third countries; whereas issuers should be enabled to redenominate outstanding debt if the debt is denominated in a national currency unit of a Member State which has redenominated part or all of the outstanding debt of its general government; whereas these provisions do not address the introduction of additional measures to amend the terms of outstanding debt to alter, among other things, the nominal amount of outstanding debt, these being matters subject to relevant national law; whereas it is desirable to allow Member States to take appropriate measures for changing the unit of account of the operating procedures of organised markets;(15) Whereas further action at the Community level may also be necessary to clarify the effect of the introduction of the euro on the application of existing provisions of Community law, in particular concerning netting, set-off and techniques of similar effect;(16) Whereas any obligation to use the euro unit can only be imposed on the basis of Community legislation; whereas in transactions with the public sector participating Member States may allow the use of the euro unit; whereas in accordance with the reference scenario decided by the European Council at its meeting held in Madrid, the Community legislation laying down the time frame for the generalisation of the use of the euro unit might leave some freedom to individual Member States;(17) Whereas in accordance with Article 105a of the Treaty the Council may adopt measures to harmonise the denominations and technical specifications of all coins;(18) Whereas banknotes and coins need adequate protection against counterfeiting;(19) Whereas banknotes and coins denominated in the national currency units lose their status of legal tender at the latest six months after the end of the transitional period; whereas limitations on payments in notes and coins, established by Member States for public reasons, are not incompatible with the status of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins, provided that other lawful means for the settlement of monetary debts are available;(20) Whereas as from the end of the transitional period references in legal instruments existing at the end of the transitional period will have to be read as references to the euro unit according to the respective conversion rates; whereas a physical redenomination of existing legal instruments is therefore not necessary to achieve this result; whereas the rounding rules defined in Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 shall also apply to the conversions to be made at the end of the transitional period or after the transitional period; whereas for reasons of clarity it may be desirable that the physical redenomination will take place as soon as appropriate;(21) Whereas paragraph 2 of Protocol 11 on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland stipulates that, inter alia, paragraph 5 of that Protocol shall have effect if the United Kingdom notifies the Council that it does not intend to move to the third stage; whereas the United Kingdom gave notice to the Council on 30 October 1997 that it does not intend to move to the third stage; whereas paragraph 5 stipulates that, inter alia, Article 109l(4) of the Treaty shall not apply to the United Kingdom;(22) Whereas Denmark, referring to paragraph 1 of Protocol 12 on certain provisions relating to Denmark has notified, in the context of the Edinburgh decision of 12 December 1992, that it will not participate in the third stage; whereas, therefore, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the said Protocol, all Articles and provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB referring to a derogation shall be applicable to Denmark;(23) Whereas, in accordance with Article 109l(4) of the Treaty, the single currency will be introduced only in the Member States without a derogation;(24) Whereas this Regulation, therefore, shall be applicable pursuant to Article 189 of the Treaty, subject to Protocols 11 and 12 and Article 109k(1),HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:PART I DEFINITIONS Article 1 For the purpose of this Regulation:- 'participating Member States` shall mean Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland,- 'legal instruments` shall mean legislative and statutory provisions, acts of administration, judicial decisions, contracts, unilateral legal acts, payment instruments other than banknotes and coins, and other instruments with legal effect,- 'conversion rate` shall mean the irrevocably fixed conversion rate adopted for the currency of each participating Member State by the Council according to the first sentence of Article 109l(4) of the Treaty,- 'euro unit` shall mean the currency unit as referred to in the second sentence of Article 2,- 'national currency units` shall mean the units of the currencies of participating Member States, as those units are defined on the day before the start of the third stage of economic and monetary union,- 'transitional period` shall mean the period beginning on 1 January 1999 and ending on 31 December 2001,- 'redenominate` shall mean changing the unit in which the amount of outstanding debt is stated from a national currency unit to the euro unit, as defined in Article 2, but which does not have through the act of redenomination the effect of altering any other term of the debt, this being a matter subject to relevant national law.PART II SUBSTITUTION OF THE EURO FOR THE CURRENCIES OF THE PARTICIPATING MEMBER STATES Article 2 As from 1 January 1999 the currency of the participating Member States shall be the euro.

It sets out the different stages leading to the introduction of the euro.\nArticle 140 TFEU sets out the criteria for economic and monetary union membership and adoption of the euro. It provides for regular monitoring of the progress that non-euro countries make towards meeting those requirements.\nKEY POINTS\nThe regulation on adopting the euro: contains details of the dates for the single currency in each country of euro adoption, for the cash changeover and for the phasing out of the national currency;confirms that the single currency is the euro, which is divided into 100 cents and replaces participating countries’ national currency at the agreed conversion rate;gives the European Central Bank and the national central banks of euro-participating countries exclusive power to put euro banknotes into circulation;allows national banknotes and coins to remain legal tender as from the day before the euro adoption date;sets out the terms of any phasing-out period for national currencies, an option no euro member took advantage of;states that national banknotes and coins remain legal tender in their respective countries until 6 months after the respective cash changeover dates;notes that euro banknotes and coins are the only legal tender in euro area countries after the respective changeover dates;authorises euro countries to apply adequate sanctions against any counterfeiting or falsification of banknotes and coins.\nTo adopt the euro, countries must meet the following 4 economic and financial conditions, known as the convergence criteria, set out in Article 140 TFEU and in Protocol No 13 of the TFEU: price stability: have an inflation rate for 1 year no higher than 1.5% of the 3 lowest national euro area rates;government finances: ensure these are sound and sustainable by limiting national deficit and debt to no more than 3% and 60%, respectively, of national gross domestic product;exchange rate stability: avoid excessive currency fluctuations for at least 2 years by participating in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which regulates rates between euro and non-euro members;interest rate convergence: have a long-term interest rate that does not exceed by 2 percentage points the rate of the 3 best-performing euro countries.\nThe European Commission helped prepare for the arrival of the euro with a wide-ranging information campaign. This targeted: businesses that would be using the euro for transactions from 1 January 2002;the general public, which would need to adapt to the new coins and notes and the prices and values they express;special needs groups such as those socially or economically isolated, with physical disabilities or unable to read or write;school children who would grow up with the new currency and could help make their parents and elders familiar with it.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 1999.\nBACKGROUND\n              \n2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the euro. On 1 January 1999, 11 EU countries fixed their exchange rates, adopted a shared monetary policy, and launched the euro as a new common currency on world financial markets. Today, the euro is the currency of 19 EU countries.\nFor more information, see:\nThe adoption of the euro: principles, procedures and criteria (European Central Bank)\nThe euro (European Commission)\n20 years of the euro (Europa).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro (OJ L 139, 11.5.1998, pp. 1-5)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 974/98 have been incorporated into the original document.
