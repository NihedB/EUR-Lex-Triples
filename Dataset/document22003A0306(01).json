The European Commission had brought the case against the Council, asking the Court to annul Council Decision 2003/106/EC, which had approved the Rotterdam Convention on behalf of the EU.\nThe Commission argued that the decision should have been based exclusively on the treaty article on common commercial policy (at the time, Article 133 of the Amsterdam Treaty) and not on the article used, which covered environmental policy (Article 175 of the same treaty).\nThe Court ruled that both articles were required to provide the necessary legal basis and annulled the original Council decision. The new decision, which took effect on the date its predecessor was adopted, ensures there is no legal void.\nFor more information, see:\nHistory of the Rotterdam Convention (European Commission)\nThe objectives of the Rotterdam Convention (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRotterdam convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (OJ L 63, 6.3.2003, pp. 29-47)\nCouncil Decision 2003/106/EC of 19 December 2002 concerning the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (OJ L 63, 6.3.2003, pp. 27-28)\nCouncil Decision 2006/730/EC of 25 September 2006 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (OJ L 299, 28.10.2006, pp. 23-25)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 649/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, pp. 60-106)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 have been incorporated in the original text.
