{"celex_id": "32010L0043", "reference": "10.7.2010\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 176/42\nCOMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2010/43/EU\nof 1 July 2010\nimplementing Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements, conflicts of interest, conduct of business, risk management and content of the agreement between a depositary and a management company\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (1), and in particular Article 12(3), Article 14(2), Article 23(6), Article 33(6) and Article 51(4) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe rules and terminology on the organisational requirements, conflicts of interest and conduct of business should be aligned to the greatest possible extent with the standards introduced in the financial services area by Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC (2) and Commission Directive 2006/73/EC of 10 August 2006 implementing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive (3). Such alignment, while taking due account of the specificities of the collective portfolio management business, would allow the achievement of equal standards not only between different financial services sectors but also within asset management business more widely, where certain requirements of Directive 2006/73/EC have already been extended by some Member States to UCITS management companies.\n(2)\nIt is appropriate to adopt these rules in the form of a Directive in order to enable the implementing provisions to be adjusted to the specificities of the particular market and legal system in each Member State. A directive will also enable a maximum level of consistency with the regime created by Directive 2006/73/EC.\n(3)\nEven though the principles laid down in this Directive have general relevance for all management companies, they are flexible enough to ensure that their application and the supervision of such application by competent authorities is proportionate and takes into account the nature, scale and complexity of a management company’s business and the diversity of the companies falling within the scope of application of Directive 2009/65/EC, and the varied nature of the different UCITS that may be managed by a management company.\n(4)\nAs far as allowed by national law, management companies should be able to make arrangements for third parties to carry out some of their activities. The implementing rules should be read accordingly. The management company should in particular perform due diligence in order to determine whether, having regard to the nature of the functions to be carried out by third parties, the undertaking performing those activities can be considered as qualified and capable of undertaking the functions in question. The third party should therefore fulfil all the organisational and conflicts of interest requirements in relation to the activity to be carried out. It also follows that the management company should verify that the third party has taken the appropriate measures in order to comply with the said requirements and should monitor effectively the compliance by the third party with these requirements. Where the delegatee is responsible for applying the rules governing the delegated activities, equivalent organisational and conflict of interests requirements should apply to the activity of monitoring the delegated activities. The management company should be able to take into account in the due diligence process the fact that the third party to whom activities are delegated will often be subject to Directive 2004/39/EC.\n(5)\nTo avoid the application of different standards to management companies and investment companies which have not designated a management company, the latter should be subject to the same rules of conduct and provisions regarding conflicts of interest and risk management as management companies. Therefore, the rules of this Directive on administrative procedures and internal control mechanism should, as a matter of good practice, apply both to management companies and investment companies that have not designated a management company, taking into account the principle of proportionality.\n(6)\nDirective 2009/65/EC requires management companies to have sound administrative procedures. In order to comply with this requirement management companies should establish a well-documented organisational structure that clearly assigns responsibilities and ensures good flows of information between all parties involved. Management companies should also establish systems to safeguard information and ensure business continuity and which are sufficient to allow them to discharge their obligations in cases where their activities are performed by third parties.\n(7)\nManagement companies should also maintain the necessary resources, in particular, to employ personnel with the right skills, knowledge and experience in order to be able to fulfil their duties.\n(8)\nWith respect to safe data processing procedures and the obligation to reconstruct all transactions involving the UCITS the management company should have arrangements in place which permit a timely and proper recording of each transaction carried out on behalf of the UCITS.\n(9)\nAccounting is one of the key areas of UCITS administration. It is therefore of paramount importance that the accounting procedures are further specified in the implementing legislation. This Directive should therefore uphold the principles that all assets and liabilities of a UCITS or of its investment compartments can be directly identified, and that accounts should be separate. In addition, where different share classes exist depending on, for example, the level of management fees, it should be possible to extract directly from the accounting the net asset value of those different classes.\n(10)\nThe clear allocation of the responsibilities of senior management and the supervisory function are central for the implementation of appropriate internal control mechanisms as required by Directive 2009/65/EC. This entails that the senior management should be responsible for the implementation of the general investment policy as referred to in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 583/2010 of 1 July 2010 implementing Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards key investor information and conditions to be met when providing key investor information or the prospectus in a durable medium other than paper or by means of a website (4). Senior management should also maintain the responsibility for the investment strategies which are the general indications concerning the strategic asset allocation of the UCITS and the investment techniques which are needed to adequately and effectively implement the investment policy. The clear division of responsibilities should also ensure that adequate control exists so as to ensure the assets of the UCITS are invested according to the fund rules or the instruments of incorporation and the applicable legal provisions and that risk limits of each UCITS are complied with. The allocation of responsibilities should be consistent with the role and responsibilities of the senior management and the supervisory function under applicable national law and corporate governance codes. It is possible that senior management includes several or all members of the board of directors.\n(11)\nTo ensure that a management company has an adequate control mechanism, a permanent compliance function and an internal audit function are necessary. The compliance function should be designed in such a way as to ensure that it may detect any risk of failure by the management company to comply with its obligations under Directive 2009/65/EC. The audit function should aim at verifying and evaluating the different control procedures and administrative arrangements the management company has put in place.\n(12)\nIt is necessary to allow management companies some flexibility in structuring the organisation of their risk management. Where it is not appropriate or proportionate to have a separate risk management function, the management company should nevertheless be able to demonstrate that specific safeguards against conflicts of interest allow for an independent performance of risk management activities.\n(13)\nDirective 2009/65/EC obliges management companies to put rules in place on personal transactions. In accordance with Directive 2006/73/EC, management companies should prevent their employees who are subject to conflicts of interest or in possession of insider information, within the meaning of Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) (5), from entering into personal transactions that are the consequence of a misuse of information they have acquired through their professional activity.\n(14)\nDirective 2009/65/EC requires that management companies ensure that each portfolio transaction involving the UCITS can be reconstructed according to its origin, the parties to it, its nature, and the time and place at which it was executed. Therefore, it is necessary to lay down requirements for recording of portfolio transactions and of subscription and redemption orders.\n(15)\nDirective 2009/65/EC requires UCITS management companies to have appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure fair treatment of UCITS in cases of unavoidable conflicts of interest. Therefore, management companies should make sure that in these cases senior management or other competent internal body of the management company are promptly informed, in order to for them to take any necessary decision to ensure the fair treatment of the UCITS and of its unit-holders.\n(16)\nManagement companies should be requested to adopt, apply and maintain an effective and adequate strategy for the exercise of voting rights attached to the financial instruments held by the UCITS they manage, with a view to ensuring that such rights are exercised to the exclusive benefit of UCITS. Information related to the strategy and its application should be freely available to investors, including via a website. As the case may be, the decision not to exercise voting rights could be considered in certain circumstances as being to the exclusive benefit of the UCITS depending upon its investment strategy. However the possibility for an investment company to vote itself or to give specific voting instructions to its management company should not be excluded.\n(17)\nThe obligation to inform senior management or other competent internal body of the management company in order for them to take necessary decisions should not limit the duty of the management companies and the UCITS to report on situations where the organisational or administrative arrangements for conflicts of interest were not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, the prevention of the risk of damage, for instance in their periodic reports. Such reporting should explain and give reasons for the decision taken by the management company, even where a decision is taken not to act, taking into account the internal policies and procedures adopted to identify, prevent and manage conflicts of interest.\n(18)\nDirective 2009/65/EC obliges management companies to act in the best interest of the UCITS they manage and the integrity of the market. Certain behaviour, such as market timing and late trading, may have detrimental effects on unit-holders and may undermine the functioning of the market. Therefore, management companies should have appropriate procedures in place to prevent malpractices. Furthermore, management companies should put in place appropriate procedures to guard against unreasonable charges and activities such as excessive trading, taking into account the UCITS investment objectives and policy.\n(19)\nManagement companies should also act in the best interest of the UCITS when directly executing orders to deal on behalf of the UCITS they manage or by transmitting them to third parties. When executing orders on behalf of the UCITS, management companies should take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for the UCITS on a consistent basis, taking into account price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size and nature of the order or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order.\n(20)\nIn order to ensure that management companies act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of the UCITS they manage as required by 2009/65/EC Directive, it is necessary to lay down rules on order handling.\n(21)\nCertain fees, commissions or non-monetary benefits which may be paid to or by a management company should not be permitted as they could have an impact on the observance of the requirements laid down in 2009/65/EC Directive that the management company should act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interests of the UCITS. Therefore, it is necessary to set out clear rules specifying where the payments of fees, commissions and non-monetary benefits are not considered a violation of those principles.\n(22)\nThe cross-border activities of the management company create new challenges for the relationship between the management company and the UCITS’ depositary. To ensure the necessary legal certainty, the main elements of the agreement between the UCITS’ depositary and the management company, where that management company is established in a Member State other than the UCITS’ home Member State, should be specified in this Directive. Given the need to ensure that this agreement properly serves its purpose it is necessary to provide for conflict of law rules which derogate from Articles 3 and 4 of the Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) (6) in such a way that the applicable law to this agreement should be the law of the UCITS’ home Member State.\n(23)\nDirective 2009/65/EC contains an obligation to specify the criteria for assessing the adequacy of a management company’s risk management process. Such criteria focus on the establishment of an adequate and documented risk management policy to be employed by management companies. This policy should enable the management companies to assess the risks of the positions taken within the portfolios they manage and the contributions of these individual risks to the overall risk profile of the portfolio. The organisation of the risk management policy should be adequate and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the management company’s activities and of the UCITS it manages.\n(24)\nThe periodical assessment, monitoring and review of the risk management policy by management companies are also a criterion to assess the adequacy of the risk management process. This criterion also includes the review of the effectiveness of measures taken to address any deficiencies in the performance of the risk management process.\n(25)\nAs an essential element in the criteria for assessing the adequacy of risk management processes, proportionate and effective risk measurement techniques should be adopted by management companies in order to measure at any time the risks which the UCITS they manage are or might be exposed to. These requirements are based on common practices agreed by competent authorities of Member States. They include both quantitative measures, as regards quantifiable risks, and qualitative methods. Electronic data processing systems and tools used for the computation of quantitative measures should be integrated with one another or with the front-office and accounting applications. Risk measurement techniques should allow for an adequate measurement of risks in periods of increased market turbulence and be reviewed whenever necessary in the interest of unit-holders. They should also allow adequate assessment of the concentration and interaction of relevant risks at the portfolio level.\n(26)\nIt is the objective of a functioning risk management system that the investment limits set by Directive 2009/65/EC such as limits on global exposure and exposure to counterparty risk are respected by the management companies. Therefore criteria should be laid down as to how the global exposure should be calculated and how counterparty risk should be calculated.\n(27)\nIt is necessary in laying down such criteria that this Directive clarifies how the global exposure can be calculated, including by using the commitment approach, the value at risk approach or advanced risk measurement methodologies. It should also lay down the main elements of the methodology according to which the management company should calculate the counterparty risk. In applying those rules, account should be taken of the conditions under which those methodologies are used, including the principles to be applied to such collateral arrangements to reduce the UCITS’ exposure to counterparty risk as well as the use of the hedging and netting arrangements, as developed by competent authorities working within the Committee of European Securities Regulators.\n(28)\nAccording to Directive 2009/65/EC, management companies are obliged to employ a process for the accurate and independent assessment of the value of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. This Directive therefore lays down detailed rules for that process in accordance with Commission Directive 2007/16/EC of 19 March 2007 implementing Council Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) as regards the clarification of certain definitions (7). As a matter of good practice, management companies should apply those requirements to instruments which expose UCITS to valuation risks equivalent to those raised by OTC derivatives, such as those relating to product illiquidity and/or the complexity of the pay-off structure. Accordingly, management companies should adopt arrangements and procedures consistent with the requirements set out in Article 44 for the valuation of less liquid or complex transferable securities and money market instruments which require the use of model-based valuation methods.\n(29)\nDirective 2009/65/EC obliges a management company to provide the relevant competent authorities with information with regard to the types of derivative instruments in which a UCITS has been invested, the underlying risks posed, applicable quantitative limits and methods chosen for estimating the risks associated with such transactions. The content and the procedure to be followed by a management company when discharging this obligation should be specified.\n(30)\nThe Committee of European Securities Regulators, established by Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (8) has been consulted for technical advice.\n(31)\nThe measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the European Securities Committee,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT-MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down rules implementing Directive 2009/65/EC:\n1.\nspecifying the procedures and arrangements as referred to under point (a) of the second subparagraph of Article 12(1), and the structures and organisational requirements to minimise conflicts of interests as referred to under point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 12(1);\n2.\nestablishing criteria for acting honestly and fairly and with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of the UCITS and the criteria for determining the types of conflict of interests, specifying the principles required to ensure that the resources are employed effectively, defining the steps that should be taken to identify, prevent, manage or disclose conflicts of interests referred to in Article 14(1) and (2);\n3.\nconcerning the particulars that need to be included in the agreements between the depository and management company in accordance with Articles 23(5) and 33(5); and\n4.\nconcerning the risk management process referred to in Article 51(1), in particular criteria for assessing the adequacy of the risk management process employed by the management company and the risk management policy and processes and the arrangements, processes and techniques for risk measurement and management relating to such criteria.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Member States shall require management companies to notify to competent authorities of their home Member State any material changes to the risk management process.\n3.   Members States shall ensure that requirements laid down in paragraph 1 are subject to review by the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State on an on-going basis and accordingly when granting authorisation.\nSECTION 2\nRisk management processes, Counterparty risk exposure and issuer concentration\nArticle 40\nMeasurement and management of risk\n1.   Member States shall require management companies to adopt adequate and effective arrangements, processes and techniques in order to:\n(a)\nmeasure and manage at any time the risks which the UCITS they manage are or might be exposed to;\n(b)\nensure compliance with limits concerning global exposure and counterparty risk, in accordance with Articles 41 and 43.\nThose arrangements, processes and techniques shall be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the business of the management companies and of the UCITS they manage and be consistent with the UCITS risk profile.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, Member States shall require management companies to take the following actions for each UCITS they manage:\n(a)\nput in place such risk measurement arrangements, processes and techniques as are necessary to ensure that the risks of taken positions and their contribution to the overall risk profile are accurately measured on the basis of sound and reliable data and that the risk measurement arrangements, processes and techniques are adequately documented;\n(b)\nconduct, where appropriate, periodic back-tests in order to review the validity of risk measurement arrangements which include model-based forecasts and estimates;\n(c)\nconduct, where appropriate, periodic stress tests and scenario analyses to address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that might adversely impact the UCITS;\n(d)\nestablish, implement and maintain a documented system of internal limits concerning the measures used to manage and control the relevant risks for each UCITS taking into account all risks which may be material to the UCITS as referred to in Article 38 and ensuring consistency with the UCITS risk-profile;\n(e)\nensure that the current level of risk complies with the risk limit system as set out in point (d) for each UCITS;\n(f)\nestablish, implement and maintain adequate procedures that, in the event of actual or anticipated breaches to the risk limit system of the UCITS, result in timely remedial actions in the best interests of unit-holders.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that management companies employ an appropriate liquidity risk management process in order to ensure that each UCITS they manage is able to comply at any time with Article 84(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC.\nWhere appropriate, management companies shall conduct stress tests which enable assessment of the liquidity risk of the UCITS under exceptional circumstances.\n4.   Member States shall require management companies to ensure that for each UCITS they manage the liquidity profile of the investments of the UCITS is appropriate to the redemption policy laid down in the fund rules or the instruments of incorporation or the prospectus.\nArticle 41\nCalculation of global exposure\n1.   Member States shall require management companies to calculate the global exposure of a managed UCITS as referred to in Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC as either of the following:\n(a)\nthe incremental exposure and leverage generated by the managed UCITS through the use of financial derivative instruments including embedded derivatives pursuant to the fourth subparagraph of Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC, which may not exceed the total of the UCITS net asset value;\n(b)\nthe market risk of the UCITS portfolio.\n2.   Member States shall require management companies to calculate the UCITS global exposure on at least a daily basis.\n3.   Member States may allow management companies to calculate global exposure by using the commitment approach, the value at risk approach or other advanced risk measurement methodologies as may be appropriate. For the purposes of this provision, ‘value at risk’ shall mean a measure of the maximum expected loss at a given confidence level over a specific time period.\nMember States shall require management companies to ensure that the method selected to measure global exposure is appropriate, taking into account the investment strategy pursued by the UCITS and the types and complexities of the financial derivative instruments used, and the proportion of the UCITS portfolio which comprises financial derivative instruments.\n4.   Where a UCITS in accordance with Article 51(2) of Directive 2009/65/EC employs techniques and instruments including repurchase agreements or securities lending transactions in order to generate additional leverage or exposure to market risk, Member States shall require management companies to take these transactions into consideration when calculating global exposure.\nArticle 42\nCommitment approach\n1.   Where the commitment approach is used for the calculation of global exposure, Member States shall require management companies to apply this approach to all financial derivative instrument positions including embedded derivatives as referred to in the fourth subparagraph of Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC, whether used as part of the UCITS general investment policy, for purposes of risk reduction or for the purposes of efficient portfolio management as referred to in Article 51(2) of that Directive.\n2.   Where the commitment approach is used for the calculation of global exposure, Member States shall require management companies to convert each financial derivative instrument position into the market value of an equivalent position in the underlying asset of that derivative (standard commitment approach).\nMember States may allow management companies to apply other calculation methods which are equivalent to the standard commitment approach.\n3.   Member States may allow a management company to take account of netting and hedging arrangements when calculating global exposure, where these arrangements do not disregard obvious and material risks and result in a clear reduction in risk exposure.\n4.   Where the use of financial derivative instruments does not generate incremental exposure for the UCITS, the underlying exposure need not be included in the commitment calculation.\n5.   Where the commitment approach is used, temporary borrowing arrangements entered into on behalf of the UCITS in accordance with Article 83 of Directive 2009/65/EC need not be included in the global exposure calculation.\nArticle 43\nCounterparty risk and issuer concentration\n1.   Member States shall require management companies to ensure that counterparty risk arising from an over-the-counter (OTC) financial derivative instrument is subject to the limits set out in Article 52 of Directive 2009/65/EC.\n2.   When calculating the UCITS exposure to a counterparty in accordance with the limits as referred to in Article 52(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, management companies shall use the positive mark-to-market value of the OTC derivative contract with that counterparty.\nManagement companies may net the derivative positions of a UCITS with the same counterparty, provided that they are able to legally enforce netting agreements with the counterparty on behalf of the UCITS. Netting shall only be permissible with respect to OTC derivative instruments with the same counterparty and not in relation to any other exposures the UCITS may have with that same counterparty.\n3.   Member States may allow management companies to reduce the UCITS exposure to a counterparty of an OTC derivative transaction through the receipt of collateral. Collateral received shall be sufficiently liquid so that it can be sold quickly at a price that is close to its pre-sale valuation.\n4.   Member States shall require management companies to take collateral into account in calculating exposure to counterparty risk as referred to in Article 52(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC when the management company passes collateral to OTC counterparty on behalf of the UCITS. Collateral passed may be taken into account on a net basis only if the management company is able to legally enforce netting arrangements with this counterparty on behalf of the UCITS.\n5.   Member States shall require management companies to calculate issuer concentration limits as referred to in Article 52 of Directive 2009/65/EC on the basis of the underlying exposure created through the use of financial derivative instruments pursuant to the commitment approach.\n6.   With respect to the exposure arising from OTC derivatives transactions as referred to in Article 52(2) of Directive 2009/65/EC, Member States shall require management companies to include in the calculation any exposure to OTC derivative counterparty risk.\nSECTION 3\nProcedures for the valuation of the OTC derivatives\nArticle 44\nProcedures for the assessment of the value of OTC derivatives\n1.   Member States shall require management companies to verify that UCITS exposures to OTC derivatives are assigned fair values that do not rely only on market quotations by the counterparties of the OTC transactions and which fulfil the criteria set out in Article 8(4) of Directive 2007/16/EC.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, management companies shall establish, implement and maintain arrangements and procedures which ensure appropriate, transparent and fair valuation of UCITS exposures to OTC derivatives.\nMember States shall require management companies to ensure that the fair value of OTC derivatives is subject to adequate, accurate and independent assessment.\nThe valuation arrangements and procedures shall be adequate and proportionate to the nature and complexity of the OTC derivatives concerned.\nManagement companies shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 5(2) and in the second subparagraph of Article 23(4) when arrangements and procedures concerning the valuation of OTC derivatives involve the performance of certain activities by third parties.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, the risk management function shall be appointed with specific duties and responsibilities.\n4.   The valuation arrangements and procedures referred to in paragraph 2 shall be adequately documented.\nSECTION 4\nTransmission of information on derivative instruments\nArticle 45\nReports on derivative instruments\n1.   Member States shall require management companies to deliver to the competent authorities of their home Member State, at least on an annual basis, reports containing information which reflects a true and fair view of the types of derivative instruments used for each managed UCITS, the underlying risks, the quantitative limits and the methods which are chosen to estimate the risks associated with the derivative transactions.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State review the regularity and completeness of information referred to in paragraph 1 and that they have an opportunity to intervene where appropriate.\nCHAPTER VII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 46\nTransposition\n1.

Accordingly, management companies should adopt arrangements and procedures consistent with the requirements set out in Article 44 for the valuation of less liquid or complex transferable securities and money market instruments which require the use of model-based valuation methods.", "triples": [" directive 2007/16/ec,  implementing,  directive 85/611/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32010L0043_p1": {"text": "directive 2010/43/eu implementing directive 2009/65/ec as regards organisational requirements, conflicts of interest, conduct of business, risk management and content of the agreement between a depositary and a management company", "triples": [" directive 2010/43/eu,  implementing,  directive 2009/65/ec"]}, "32010L0043_p2": {"text": "Commission directive 2010/43/eu of 1 July 2010 implementing directive 2009/65/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements, conflicts of interest, conduct of business, risk management and content of the agreement between a depositary and a management company (OJ L 176, 10.7.2010, pp. 42-61)", "triples": [" directive 2010/43/eu,  implementing,  directive 2009/65/ec"]}, "32010L0043_p3": {"text": "Commission regulation 583/2010 of 1 July 2010 implementing directive 2009/65/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards key investor information and conditions to be met when providing key investor information or the prospectus in a durable medium other than paper or by means of a website (OJ L 176, 10.7.2010, pp. 1-15)", "triples": [" regulation 583/2010,  implementing,  directive 2009/65/ec"]}, "32010L0043_p4": {"text": "Commission regulation 584/2010 of 1 July 2010 implementing directive 2009/65/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the form and content of the standard notification letter and UCITS attestation, the use of electronic communication between competent authorities for the purpose of notification, and procedures for on-the-spot verifications and investigations and the exchange of information between competent authorities (OJ L 176, 10.7.2010, pp. 16-27)", "triples": [" regulation 584/2010,  implementing,  directive 2009/65/ec"]}, "32010L0043_p5": {"text": "Commission directive 2010/42/eu of 1 July 2010 implementing directive 2009/65/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards certain provisions concerning fund mergers, master-feeder structures and notification procedure (OJ L 176, 10.7.2010, pp. 28-41)", "triples": [" directive 2010/42/eu,  implementing,  directive 2009/65/ec"]}}}
