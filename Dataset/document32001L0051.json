In addition, in order to ensure a greater effectiveness of this objective, the financial penalties currently provided for by the Member States for cases where carriers fail to meet their control obligations should be harmonised to the extent possible, taking into account the differences in legal systems and practices between the Member States.(2) This measure is among the general provisions aimed at curbing migratory flows and combating illegal immigration.(3) Application of this Directive is without prejudice to the obligations resulting from the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967.(4) The freedom of the Member States to retain or introduce additional measures or penalties for carriers, whether referred to in this Directive or not, should not be affected.(5) Member States should ensure that in any proceedings brought against carriers which may result in the application of penalties, the rights of defence and the right of appeal against such decisions can be exercised effectively.(6) This Directive builds on the Schengen acquis, in accordance with the Protocol integrating it into the framework of the European Union, as laid down by Annex A to Council Decision 1999/435/EC of 20 May 1999 concerning the definition of the Schengen acquis for the purpose of determining, in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on European Union, the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions which constitute the acquis(3).(7) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 25 October 2000, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Directive.(8) Pursuant to Article 1 of the aforementioned Protocol, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Directive.
