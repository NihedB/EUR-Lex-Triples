{"celex_id": "32011R1214", "reference": "29.11.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 316/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 1214/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 November 2011\non the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 133 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe introduction of the euro has considerably increased the need for cross-border transport of cash by road. Within the euro area, banks, the large retail sector and other professional cash handlers should be able to contract with the cash-in-transit (CIT) company that offers the best price and/or service and to take advantage of the cash services of the nearest national central bank (NCB) branch or CIT cash centre, even if it is located in another Member State. Furthermore, a large number of Member States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter ‘participating Member States’) have arranged, or may want to arrange for, euro banknotes and coins to be produced abroad. The very principle of a single currency implies the freedom to move cash between participating Member States.\n(2)\nDue to the marked differences between Member States’ national law, it is generally very difficult to carry out the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between participating Member States. This situation is in contradiction to the principle of the free circulation of the euro and is to the detriment of the principle of freedom to provide services, which are among the fundamental principles of the European Union.\n(3)\nThis Regulation is the response to the possible presentation of harmonisation instruments for the transport of cash, as expressed in Article 38(b) of Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market (3).\n(4)\nWith a view to improving CIT security for both the CIT security staff involved and the public, use of the intelligent banknote neutralisation system (IBNS) should be encouraged and, after a thorough analysis of the potential impacts by the Commission, should be capable of being developed in a manner entailing harmonisation of IBNS among the participating Member States, without prejudice to the rules set out in this Regulation on applicable transport arrangements.\n(5)\nIn view of the particular dangers to the health and life of both CIT security staff and the general public that are associated with the activity of transporting cash, it is appropriate that the cross-border transport of euro cash be subject to holding a specific cross-border CIT-licence. Such a licence should be held in addition to the national CIT licence that is required in most participating Member States, the form of which this Regulation does not harmonise. It is, moreover, appropriate that CIT companies established in those participating Member States which do not have a specific approval procedure for CIT-companies in addition to their general rules for the security or transport sectors, demonstrate a minimum experience of 24 months of regularly transporting cash in the Member State of establishment without infringing national law before they are granted a cross-border CIT licence by that Member State. Such an approach would increase mutual confidence between Member States.\n(6)\nIn order to avoid the duplication of obligations and the introduction of an unnecessarily burdensome procedure, it is furthermore appropriate to provide that the holder of a cross-border CIT licence is not required also to hold a Community licence for the international carriage of goods by road, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on common rules for access to the international road haulage market (4).\n(7)\nThe professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between participating Member States should fully comply with this Regulation or with the law of the Member State of origin, the host Member State and, if applicable, the Member State of transit.\n(8)\nThis Regulation is designed to allow the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between participating Member States under conditions that guarantee the security of the transaction, the safety of the CIT security staff involved and of the public and the free movement of euro cash. In accordance with normal market practice, it is also appropriate to allow a limited value of non-euro cash to be transported in the same CIT vehicle.\n(9)\nIn view of the specific requirements facing cross-border CIT workers, it is appropriate that they follow a specific cross-border training module as detailed in Annex VI. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication, the cross-border training module should not include the elements already covered by compulsory training required for carrying out the domestic CIT activity.\n(10)\nDue to the specific conditions in the CIT sector, it is difficult to organise safe multi-day euro cash deliveries. It is therefore appropriate that a CIT vehicle carrying out the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road return to its Member State of origin on the same day.\n(11)\nThe Commission should put forward a proposal to amend the definition of ‘daytime’ and/or of the minimum required length of ad-hoc initial training laid down in this Regulation in the event that the social partners at Union level agree that another definition is more appropriate.\n(12)\nAccording to Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009, the number of operations that may be carried out in the host Member State following the international carriage from another Member State is limited to three cabotage operations within 7 days. However, due to the specific characteristics of the CIT sector, it is normal practice for a CIT vehicle to carry out a much larger number of euro cash deliveries/pick-ups per day. It is therefore appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 by not imposing any limit upon the number of euro cash deliveries/pick-ups that a CIT vehicle may carry out in a host Member State during a single day.\n(13)\nNational rules governing the behaviour of CIT security staff outside a CIT vehicle and governing the security of euro cash delivery/pick-up locations should not cover the possible use of banknote neutralisation systems in combination with the transport of banknotes in a fully-armoured CIT vehicle not equipped with IBNS.\n(14)\nArticle 1(3)(a) of Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (5) covers posting situations where an undertaking provides transnational services on its own account and under its direction under a contract concluded between the undertaking and the party for whom the services are intended.\n(15)\nConsidering the specific nature of CIT transport services, there is a need to provide for the analogous application of Directive 96/71/EC to all cross-border euro cash transport services in order to provide legal certainty for operators and ensure the practical applicability of the Directive in that sector.\n(16)\nDue to the specificity of the transport activities concerned and the occasional character of some of those activities, the analogous application of the minimum protection rules laid down in Directive 96/71/EC should be limited to the minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates, as referred to in Article 3(1)(c) of that Directive and these should be guaranteed for the duration of the whole working day in order not to impose an unnecessary administrative burden on the operators. As referred to in Directive 96/71/EC, and within the limits of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the concept of minimum rates of pay is defined by the national law or practice of the Member State where the worker is posted. Where, as a result of contracts, regulations, administrative provisions or practical arrangements, a CIT worker carries out cross-border transport for more than 100 working days in a calendar year in another Member State, it is appropriate that the minimum protection rules laid down in Directive 96/71/EC apply to such a worker mutatis mutandis.\n(17)\nThe application of minimum protection rules in the host Member State should be without prejudice to the application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to the worker under the law, collective agreement or employment contract in the worker’s Member State of origin.\n(18)\nFor the purpose of establishing the relevant minimum protection rules, it is appropriate that the provisions on information cooperation in Article 4 of Directive 96/71/EC apply mutatis mutandis. In this respect, Member States should be able to avail themselves of the administrative cooperation and exchange of information provided for in Directive 96/71/EC.\n(19)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on controls of cash entering or leaving the Community (6).\n(20)\nIn order to take into account technological progress and possible new European standards, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the amendment of the technical rules on standards in regard to the IBNS, the armouring of CIT vehicles, bulletproof vests and weapons strong-boxes. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level and of the social partners. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(21)\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve its objective, namely to facilitate the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nSECTION 1\nCOMMON RULES GOVERNING ALL CROSS-BORDER TRANSPORT OF EURO CASH BY ROAD\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘participating Member States’ means those Member States whose currency is the euro;\n(b)\n‘cross-border transport of euro cash by road’ means the professional transport, either for remuneration on behalf of third parties or carried out within a cash-in-transit (hereinafter ‘CIT’) company, by a CIT vehicle by road of euro banknotes or coins from a participating Member State, for supplying euro banknotes or coins to, or collecting them from, one or more locations in one or more other participating Member States, and in the Member State of origin – without prejudice to the transport of a maximum of 20 % of non-euro cash in relation to the total value of cash transported in the same CIT vehicle – where the majority of euro cash deliveries/pick-ups made by a CIT vehicle during the same day is carried out on the territory of the host Member State, or, in the case of point-to-point transport, where the transport takes place between two different participating Member States;\n(c)\n‘cross-border CIT licence’ means a licence delivered by the granting authority of the Member State of origin which authorises the holder to carry out the cross-border transport of euro cash by road between participating Member States in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation;\n(d)\n‘granting authority’ means the authority in the Member State of origin in charge of issuing the cross-border CIT licence;\n(e)\n‘Member State of origin’ means the participating Member State in whose territory the CIT company is established.

Such weapons shall remain inaccessible to the CIT security staff throughout the journey across that Member State’s territory. They may be removed from the weapons strong-box when entering the territory of a Member State whose law allows CIT security staff to be armed and shall be removed from it when entering the territory of a Member State whose law requires CIT security staff to be armed. Opening the weapons strong-box shall require remote intervention by the CIT vehicle’s control centre and shall be conditional upon verification by the control centre of the vehicle’s exact geographical location.\nThe requirements set out in the first subparagraph shall also apply if the type or the calibre of the weapon is not allowed under the law of the Member State of transit or of the host Member State.\n3.   Where a CIT vehicle whose Member State of origin does not allow CIT security staff to carry arms, enters the territory of a Member State whose law requires CIT security staff to carry arms, the CIT company shall ensure that the CIT security staff on board is provided with the required weapons and that they fulfil the minimum training requirements of the host Member State.\n4.   CIT security staff who are armed or who travel in a CIT vehicle with arms on board shall have a professional weapons licence or authorisation issued by the national authorities of the Member State of transit and/or the host Member State, where those Member States allow CIT security staff to be armed, and fulfil all the national requirements for that professional weapons licence or authorisation. For that purpose, Member States may recognise the professional weapons licence or authorisation of the other Member State.\n5.   Member States shall establish a single central national contact point to which CIT companies established in other Member States may submit applications for a professional weapons licence or authorisation for their CIT security staff. Federal Member States may establish contact points at State level. Member States shall inform the applicant of the outcome of the application within 3 months from the submission of a complete application file.\n6.   In order to make it easier for CIT security staff who are employed by a company established in another Member State to fulfil the national requirements for obtaining a professional weapons licence or authorisation, Member States shall provide for validation of equivalent professional weapons training followed in the Member State where the applicant’s employer is established. If this is not possible, Member States shall ensure that the necessary professional weapons training is provided on their own territory in an EU official language which is an official language of the Member State where the applicant’s employer is established.\nArticle 7\nCIT vehicle equipment\n1.

In reply to a request for verification made by the authorities of the Member State of origin, the host Member State or the Member State of transit, undertakings carrying out cross-border transport of euro cash in CIT vehicles using IBNS shall supply written evidence of approval of the IBNS model used within 48 hours.\nArticle 8\nRole of the national police forces\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the application of national rules that require:\n(a)\ncash-transport operations to be notified to the police in advance;\n(b)\nCIT vehicles to be equipped with a device that allows them to be tracked at a remote distance by the police;\n(c)\nhigh-value point-to-point transport to be escorted by the police.\nArticle 9\nRules to ensure the security of the cash delivery/pick-up locations in the host Member State\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the application of national rules governing the behaviour of CIT security staff outside a CIT vehicle and the security of the locations where cash is delivered/picked up in the Member State concerned.\nArticle 10\nRemoval of neutralised banknotes from circulation\nCIT companies operating under this Regulation shall remove from circulation all banknotes that may have been neutralised that they encounter while carrying out their activities. They shall hand over those banknotes to the appropriate NCB branch of their Member State of origin and provide a written statement on the cause and nature of the neutralisation. If those banknotes are collected in a host Member State, the NCB of the host Member State shall be informed by the NCB of the Member State of origin.\nArticle 11\nMutual information\n1.   Member States shall submit to the Commission the rules referred to in Articles 8 and 9 as well as information on which IBNS have been homologated by them and shall immediately inform the Commission of any change affecting those rules and homologations. The Commission shall ensure that those rules as well as a list of homologated IBNS are published in all the EU official languages which are the official languages of the relevant participating Member States through the appropriate channels, with a view to informing swiftly all the actors involved in a CIT cross-border activity.\n2.   Member States shall keep a register of all the companies to which they have delivered a cross-border CIT licence and shall inform the Commission about its content. They shall update the register, including in relation to any decision to suspend or withdraw a licence pursuant to Article 22 and shall immediately inform the Commission of such update. To facilitate information-sharing, the Commission shall set up a central secured database containing data on licences issued, suspended or withdrawn, which shall be accessible to the relevant authorities of the participating Member States.\n3.   In implementing Article 5(1)(a), the Member State of origin shall take due account of information concerning the criminal record, repute and integrity of CIT security staff that is communicated to it by the host Member State.\n4.   Member States shall inform the Commission about their specific training requirements for CIT security staff for the purpose of the ad-hoc initial training referred to in Article 5(1)(c). The Commission shall ensure that that information is published in all the EU official languages which are the official languages of the relevant participating Member States through the appropriate channels, with a view to informing all the actors involved in a CIT cross-border activity.\n5.   Member States shall inform the Commission of the addresses and other contact details of the national contact points referred to in Article 6(5) and of relevant national law. The Commission shall ensure that this information is published through the appropriate channels, with a view to informing all the actors involved in a CIT cross-border activity.\n6.   Where a Member State withdraws the professional weapons licence or authorisation that it has delivered to a member of the CIT security staff of a company established in another Member State, it shall inform the granting authority of the Member State of origin thereof.\n7.   Member States shall inform the Commission of the addresses and other contact details of the relevant authorities referred to in Article 12(2). The Commission shall ensure that this information is published through the appropriate channels, with a view to informing all the actors involved in a CIT cross-border activity.\nArticle 12\nInformation prior to the start of cross-border transport\n1.   A company holding or having submitted an application for a cross-border CIT licence shall inform the granting authority at least 2 months before it begins its cross-border activity of the Member States in which it will carry out CIT transport. The Member State of origin shall subsequently immediately notify the Member States concerned that the cross-border activity is to start.\n2.   A company that intends to carry out cross-border cash transport shall provide in advance the relevant authority or authorities indicated by the host Member State with information on the type or types of transport it will use, the names of the persons who may carry out such transport and the type of any weapons carried.\nSECTION 2\nSPECIFIC RULES FOR EACH TYPE OF TRANSPORT\nArticle 13\nApplicable transport arrangements\n1.   With respect to the cross-border transport of euro banknotes by road carried out on its territory, each Member State shall allow:\n(a)\nat least one of the options laid down in Article 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18; and\n(b)\nthose options laid down in Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 that are comparable to the transport arrangements allowed for domestic CIT transport.\nArticle 17 shall apply to all Member States as regards point-to-point transport.\n2.   With respect to the cross-border transport of euro coins by road carried out on its territory, each Member State shall allow:\n(a)\nat least one of the options laid down in Article 19 or 20; and\n(b)\nthose options laid down in Articles 19 and 20 that are comparable to the transport arrangements allowed for domestic CIT transport.\n3.   Transport which includes both euro banknotes and coins shall be covered by the transport arrangements for the cross-border transport of euro banknotes.\n4.   As regards the application of Articles 14, 15, 16 and 18, a Member State may decide that only end-to-end IBNS may be used on its territory for the servicing of off-premises ATMs or other types of off-premises cash dispensers, provided that the same rules apply for domestic CIT transport.\n5.   Participating Member States shall notify the Commission of the transport arrangements which are applicable in accordance with this Article. The Commission shall publish a corresponding information notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. The applicable transport arrangements shall take effect 1 month after publication of the information notice. Participating Member States shall use the same procedure when new transport arrangements become applicable pursuant to this Article.\n6.   If a host Member State or a Member State of transit finds that an IBNS displays serious deficiencies as regards the technical characteristics normally required, namely that the cash can be accessed without triggering the neutralisation mechanism or the IBNS has been modified after homologation in such a way that it no longer fulfils the homologation criteria, it shall inform the Commission and the Member State that granted the homologation and may ask that new tests be carried out on that IBNS. Pending the results of those new tests, Member States may provisionally prohibit the use of that IBNS on their territory. They shall, without delay, inform the Commission and the other participating Member States thereof.\nArticle 14\nTransport of banknotes in an unarmoured CIT vehicle of ordinary appearance equipped

IV;\n(c)\nthe cabin of the vehicle is equipped with a bulletproof vest for each member of the CIT security staff on board, at least respecting the norm VPAM class 5, NIJ IIIA or an equivalent standard;\n(d)\nthere are at least two CIT security staff per vehicle.\nThe CIT security staff may wear the bulletproof vests referred to in point (c) during the transport and shall wear them where required by the law of the Member State where they are situated.\nSECTION 3\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 21\nCompliance\nDuring the period of validity of a cross-border CIT licence, Member States of origin shall ensure that the rules laid down in this Regulation are complied with, including via random inspections without prior notification to the company. Such inspections may also be carried out by host Member States.\nArticle 22\nPenalties\n1.   Where the competent national authorities find that there has been an infringement of one of the terms under which the cross-border CIT licence was granted, the granting authority may send a warning to the company concerned, impose a fine, suspend the licence for a period ranging from 2 weeks to 2 months or withdraw the licence completely, depending on the nature or severity of the infringement. The granting authority may also prohibit the company concerned from applying for a new licence for a period of up to 5 years.\n2.   The Member State of transit or the host Member State shall communicate any infringement of this Regulation – including infringements of the national rules referred to in Articles 8 and 9 – to the competent national authorities of the Member State of origin, which shall decide on an appropriate penalty. The Member State of transit or the host Member State may furthermore impose a fine in case of infringement of the national rules referred to in Articles 8 and 9 or of the applicable transport arrangements referred to in Article 13. It may prohibit CIT security staff that have committed such infringements from carrying out cross-border cash transport on its territory if the infringement can be imputed to them.\n3.   The Member State of transit or the host Member State may suspend the right of a CIT company to transport euro cash by road on its territory for a maximum period of 2 months, pending a decision by the granting authority of the Member State of origin which shall be taken within that same period, where the CIT company:\n(a)\nhas not complied with the provisions of this Regulation relating to the minimum number of CIT security staff per CIT vehicle or relating to weapons;\n(b)\ncarries out its transport activity in a way that constitutes a danger to public order; or\n(c)\nhas committed repeated infringements of this Regulation.\n4.   The Member State that issued the professional weapons licence or authorisation may impose penalties on the CIT security staff in accordance with its national rules in case of infringement of its national weapons law.\n5.   The penalties shall be proportionate to the severity of the infringement.\nArticle 23\nEmergency security measures\n1.   A Member State may decide to introduce temporary security measures going beyond those provided for in this Regulation in the event of an urgent problem affecting significantly the security of CIT operations. Such temporary measures shall affect all CIT transport in all or part of the national territory, shall apply for a maximum period of 4 weeks and shall be notified immediately to the Commission. The Commission shall ensure their swift publication through the appropriate channels.\n2.   The prolongation of the temporary measures provided for in paragraph 1 beyond a period of 4 weeks shall be subject to prior authorisation by the Commission. The Commission shall decide whether to grant such prior authorisation within 72 hours of receipt of a request.\nArticle 24\nRemuneration of CIT security staff carrying out cross-border transport\nCIT security staff carrying out cross-border transport in accordance with this Regulation shall be guaranteed the relevant minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates, in the host Member State in accordance with Article 3(1)(c) of Directive 96/71/EC. If the relevant minimum rates of pay in the host Member State are higher than the wage paid to the employee in the Member State of origin, the relevant minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates, of the host Member State shall apply for the whole working day. If transport is carried out in more than one host Member State during the same day and more than one of those Member States have higher relevant minimum rates of pay than the wage applied in the Member State of origin, the highest of those minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates, shall apply for the whole working day.\nHowever, where, as a result of contracts, regulations, administrative provisions or practical arrangements, a CIT worker carries out cross-border transport for more than 100 working days, wholly or partially spent in a calendar year in another Member State, the terms and conditions of employment referred to in Directive 96/71/EC shall be applied fully for all the working days spent wholly or partially in that host Member State in that calendar year.\nFor the purpose of establishing the relevant terms and conditions of employment, Article 4 of Directive 96/71/EC shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 25\nCommittee on the cross-border transport of euro cash\n1.   A Committee on the cross-border transport of euro cash shall be established. It shall be chaired by the Commission and gather two representatives per participating Member State, together with two representatives of the European Central Bank.\n2.   The Committee shall meet at least once a year to exchange views on the implementation of this Regulation. For this purpose, it shall consult the stakeholders in the sector, including the social partners, and take their views into account as appropriate. It shall be consulted on the preparation of the review referred to in Article 26.\nArticle 26\nReview\nBy 1 December 2016 and every 5 years thereafter, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Regulation. For that purpose, it shall consult the stakeholders in the sector including the social partners followed by the Member States. The report shall, in particular, examine the possibility of establishing common training requirements for the carrying of arms by CIT -security staff and of amending Article 24 in the light of Directive 96/71/EC, take due account of technological progress in the area of IBNS, consider the potential added value of granting Union CIT licences on a group basis and assess whether this Regulation needs to be revised accordingly.\nArticle 27\nAmendment of technical rules\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 28 concerning amendments to Annex II and to the technical rules on the standards applicable to the armouring of CIT vehicles and to bulletproof vests referred to in Articles 16, 17, 18 and 20, and to weapons strong-boxes referred to in Article 6(2), with a view to taking into account technological progress and possible new European standards.\nArticle 28\nExercise of the delegation\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.

Definitions and general provisions\nAn IBNS may contain either banknotes (packaged or unpackaged) or one or several cassettes for ATMs or other types of cash dispensers.\nAn IBNS must have been homologated in a participating Member State in order to be used for cross-border transport of euro cash under this Regulation. The homologation must be made according to an existing European specific standard. As long as there is no such standard, the homologation must be made in accordance with this Annex.\nII.   IBNS approval procedure\n(a)   In order to be homologated, the IBNS must have passed various tests in a test laboratory that has been approved or recognised by a participating Member State. It must furthermore be accompanied by instructions for its use, which indicate the operating procedures and conditions that ensure the effectiveness of the destruction or neutralisation of the banknotes.\nThese tests must make it possible to ascertain that the following technical characteristics of the IBNS are satisfactory:\n(i)\nMain required functions of the monitoring system\n—\npermanently to monitor and record the instructions concerning the conditions for access to, and use of, the IBNS,\n—\ncontinuously to verify compliance with these instructions and detect anomalous situations,\n—\nautomatically and immediately to neutralise the banknotes in the event of non-compliance with the instructions, detection of anomalous situations or opening of the container outside the pre-programmed time periods and/or locations.\n(ii)\nLocation where the monitoring system may be programmed and influence of CIT security staff on how the IBNS operates\nAn IBNS must be programmed only in a secured area. An end-to-end IBNS must only be programmed in a secure location.\nCIT security staff must not have any means whatsoever of influencing the operation of the IBNS outside the pre-programmed time periods and/or locations. However, where there is a time-delay system for triggering the neutralisation, the CIT security staff may re-initiate the time delay once.\n(iii)\nLocation where the IBNS may be opened (for end-to-end systems)\nAn IBNS must only be opened in the pre-programmed destinations.\n(b)   The IBNS must be retested every 5 years, even where the national approval is issued for an unlimited period. If the new tests are not conclusive, the homologation ceases to be valid for cross-border transport under this Regulation.\n(c)   In order to pass the tests, one of the following results must be achieved upon performance of the tests:\n—\nit was not possible to access the banknotes and there was no damage to the IBNS, the mechanism of which remained operational, or\n—\nthe IBNS was damaged but it was not possible to access the banknotes without triggering the neutralisation system.\nIII.   Testing procedures\nThe method used to carry out the tests and the standards establishing the result which the systems tested must achieve are laid down in this Annex. However, adjustments may be made at national level so as to bring them into line with the existing test protocols followed by the laboratories in each Member State. In order for the IBNS to be homologated, the IBNS-manufacturer must ensure that the results of the testing procedures in this Annex are transmitted to the homologating authority.\n(a)   Test of IBNS’ resistance to different attack scenarios\nMember States must carry out six of the various tests simulating attack scenarios, while the other tests may also be carried out in accordance with the applicable national rules.\nFor each of the tests carried out, the result must be a pass within the meaning of point II(c):\n—\ncompulsory tests:\n1.\ncutting of the power supply;\n2.\nbreaking into the container;\n3.\nopening the container by destructive means (e.g. sledgehammer);\n4.\nrapid cutting (‘guillotining’);\n5.\nimmersion in liquid;\n6.\ngradual and immediate exposure to extreme temperatures (hot and cold): e.g. cooling in liquid nitrogen and heating in a preheated oven,\n—\nrecommended tests that may also be carried out:\n7.\nresistance to firearms (e.g. with 12-bore cartridges);\n8.\nuse of chemicals;\n9.\nfree drop;\n10.\nexposure to significant electromagnetic surges;\n11.\nexposure to significant electrostatic surges.\n(b)   Effectiveness of neutralisation of banknotes\nThe neutralisation processes currently used are staining, chemical destruction and pyrotechnical destruction. Since technological developments may occur, the list of processes used is non-exhaustive and purely indicative.\nFollowing any unauthorised attempt to access the banknotes via the various forms of attack, the banknotes must be either destroyed or stained. A minimum of three tests must be carried out.\n100 % of the banknotes must be irreversibly neutralised. It must furthermore be apparent for any holder of the banknotes that they have been subject to neutralisation.\nA minimum of 10 % of the surface area of both sides of each banknote must be stained if the banknotes are in safe-bags. If the banknotes are not in safe-bags, a minimum of 20 % of the surface area of both sides of each banknote must be stained. For destruction systems, a minimum of 20 % of the surface area of each banknote must be destroyed in both cases.\n(c)   Content of the tests for banknotes’ resistance to cleaning – for IBNS using staining\nFor such ‘cleaning’, use must be made of different products or combinations of products. Different scenarios must be arranged so as to vary the temperature and duration of cleaning. Two procedures must be used for these cleaning tests:\n—\ncleaning must be carried out immediately after staining, and\n—\ncleaning must be carried out 24 hours after staining,\nThese tests must be carried out on a representative sample of real banknotes used in the euro area.\nOne of the following results must be obtained at the end of these tests:\n—\nthe cleaning leads to destruction of the banknotes,\n—\nthe cleaning leaves ink visible on a surface area of at least 10 % of each banknote (density test of the ink used),\n—\nthe cleaning leads to the mutilation of both the banknote's original colours and its security features.\nIV.   Safety guarantees for the systems used\nChemical substances released from IBNS in order to neutralise banknotes may be subject to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and establishing a European Chemicals Agency (1). That Regulation addresses risks to human health and the environment of substances manufactured, imported or used on their own, in a mixture, or in an article.\nIn order for the IBNS to be homologated, the manufacturer must verify whether it has to register or notify substances contained in its products or to communicate information on safe use to its customers. The manufacturer may also have legal obligations resulting from the inclusion of these substances in the candidate list of substances of very high concern or in the list of substances subject to authorisation set out in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. These obligations refer not only to the listed substances on their own or in mixtures, but also to their presence in articles.\nA certificate must be supplied to the homologating authority of the Member State by the IBNS manufacturer, which includes the results of this verification and which lists the substances or elements used to ensure destruction or neutralisation of the banknotes and attests that they do not pose a serious risk to health in the case of inhalation by, or contact with, the skin of the CIT security staff or of the NCB staff. The certificate must furthermore indicate possible precautionary measures to be taken. The homologating authority must transmit the certificate to the NCBs of the participating Member States with respect to IBNS homologated by it.\nTo this effect, the certificate may include an analysis of the risks of exposure to the chemicals, i.e. maximum permissible duration of exposure for a quantity to be determined.\n(1)  OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\nANNEX III\nIBNS PICTOGRAMS\nPictogram for CIT vehicles equipped with IBNS\nPictogram for banknote containers equipped with IBNS\nANNEX IV\nPICTOGRAM FOR CIT VEHICLES CARRYING EXCLUSIVELY COINS\nANNEX V\nARMOURING SPECIFICATIONS\nThe minimum armouring requirement referred to in Section 2 of this Regulation means that the armouring of the CIT vehicle is able to resist gunfire from a rifle of Kalashnikov type with a calibre of 7,62 mm × 39 mm using full steel jacket (plated) iron core ammunition with a mass of 7,97 grams (+/– 0,1 gram) with a velocity of at least 700 metres/second at a firing distance of 10 metres (+/– 0,5 metres).\nANNEX VI\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF INITIAL TRAINING FOR CIT SECURITY STAFF THAT CARRY OUT CROSS-BORDER EURO CASH TRANSPORT\nCIT workers taking part in professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between Member States in the euro area must:\n(1)\nfully follow and complete at least the appropriate initial training as provided by their national regulations of reference and/or the relevant collective labour agreements or, in the absence thereof, the national CIT/security association's or internal company's training courses;\n(2)\nsuccessfully pass the examinations following this initial training or any procedure aimed at testing the learning outcome;\n(3)\nfully follow and complete the additional and obligatory training module as provided for in this Annex consisting of at least:\n—\ncross-border CIT procedures,\n—\nUnion law on CIT,\n—\napplicable national law covering CIT of the Member States of transit and the host Member States,\n—\ndriving rules for CIT in the Member States of transit and the host Member States (including right for CIT vehicles to use specific driving lanes),\n—\nnational security protocols in case of attack in the Member States of transit and the host Member States,\n—\norganisation and operating procedures of CIT transport protected by IBNS technology of the Member States of transit and the host Member States,\n—\napplicable national operational protocols, rules and regulations of the Member States of transit and the host Member States,\n—\nnational protocols in case of emergency of the Member States of transit and the host Member States in case of breakdown, road accidents, and technical and mechanical failures of any CIT equipment and vehicle,\n—\nnational administrative procedures and company rules within the Member States of transit and the host Member States regarding communication with the control point etc. of all Member States transited and of all host Member States,\n—\ninformation and training regarding cooperation and appropriate protocols with national, regional and local police forces including with regards to checks carried out on CIT vehicles and security staff,\n—\napplicable national and Union law and/or applicable collective agreements regarding working time, number of breaks necessary, working conditions, wages applicable,\n—\napplicable national and Union law and/or applicable collective agreement stipulations regarding CIT security staff rest periods – when needed, how often, duration of each break period, secure location, communication with control centres, etc.,\n—\napplicable security rules for deliveries/pick-ups (secure location, pavement risk management etc.),\n—\nnational law of reference regarding the use of weapons and their storage,\n—\noffensive and defensive driving techniques,\n—\nrelevant training on the use of GPS, telephone and other technical equipment/systems used in cross-border CIT transport,\n—\nnational health and safety regulation in the Member States of transit and the host Member States relevant for workers transporting valuables and travelling with large vehicles by road and protocols in case of injury or sickness of employees,\n—\nfirst aid training.\nThe training must furthermore include the following items:\n—\npreventive and remedial measures in the areas of stress management and third party violence,\n—\nrisk assessment at work,\n—\nlanguage training as necessary to fulfil the language requirements set out in Article 5(2).\nANNEX VII\nCOUNCIL OF EUROPE’S COMMON EUROPEAN FRAMEWORK OF REFERENCE FOR LANGUAGES: LEVELS\nUser B1: Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken.

Banks, the retail sector and other professional cash handlers should be able to contract with CIT companies offering the best price and/or service. They should also be entitled to take advantage of the cash services of the nearest national central bank branch or CIT cash centre, even if it is located in another euro-area country. Euro-area countries (‘participating countries’) also have the right to arrange for euro banknotes and coins to be produced abroad. Retailers and banks located in border areas may wish to obtain their supplies from the cash centre nearest to them, which is not necessarily in the same EU country. The very principle of a single currency implies the freedom to move cash between participating euro-area countries.\nA full harmonisation of CIT transport in participating EU countries was not considered feasible, nor was a system considered appropriate where authorisation in one EU country would be valid in all EU countries (‘mutual recognition’). Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 lays down a set of common rules valid in all EU countries, without prejudice to national rules for certain aspects explicitly indicated in the regulation. It does not involve full harmonisation, as the common rules only apply to cross-border transport.\nCross-border CIT licence\nGiven the potential threats, associated with the activity of transporting cash, to the security of the staff of CIT companies and the general public, the cross-border transport of euro cash is subject to holding a specific cross-border CIT licence. National authorities grant this licence for a period of 5 years if CIT companies meet certain conditions, such as requirements for security staff or for vehicles.\nThe CIT licences are registered in the EU’s Internal Market Information System to allow public authorities to easily access them.\nStaff carrying out cross-border CIT are entitled to the minimum rates of pay that apply in the host countries.\nCross-border transport of euro cash\nThe cross-border CIT licence grants the holder the right to transport euro banknotes and coins across borders by road, during daylight hours and only if both the majority of the pick-up or of the delivery is in the host country and the value of euro cash is at least 80 % of the total cash value transported in the vehicle. Some specific transport arrangements are explicitly exempted from the scope of the regulation, such as point-to-point transports to and from national central banks or cash production sites.\nTransport arrangements\nThe regulation provides for 5 types of transport arrangements for euro banknotes and 2 types for euro coins. It defines the conditions of each, such as:\nvehicle armouring;\nthe use of intelligent banknote neutralisation systems (IBNS);\nthe presence of CIT security staff.\nThe participating countries decide which transport arrangements apply in their territory.\nRole of IBNS and removal of neutralised banknotes\nThe regulation seeks to facilitate the use of IBNS so as to improve the security of CIT security staff and the public. CIT companies must remove neutralised banknotes (banknotes rendered unusable to protect them against unauthorised access) from circulation so that they are no longer used for payment.\nHost country rules applying to transport: national police force, public security and carrying of firearms\nCIT aspects not covered by the common rules of the regulation are governed by national law, subject to the general rules of the treaty (such as the principle of non-discrimination), and must be respected in the host country by the CIT company carrying out the cross-border transport. These national rules concern:\nthe role of the police force (such as prior notification, escorting or distant remote tracking);\nsecurity rules on cash delivery or pick-up at locations; and\nrules on firearms.\nNotification and information\nLicence holders must inform the participating country of the intended start of cross-border transport.\nParticipating countries must inform each other of cross-border business notified by the CIT companies.\nOn the Europa website, the European Commission publishes all information on: IBNS approved by participating countries;national rules on the role of police forces and on the security of locations where the cash is delivered or picked up from;national CIT training requirements;the credentials of the national granting authority; andthe host administration that has to be notified about the start of cross-border transport.\nThe Commission publishes the applicable transport arrangements as chosen by the participating countries in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nCompliance checks, penalties and emergency security measures\nParticipating countries carry out compliance checks on CIT companies acting in their territory. Penalties can be applied in cases of non-compliance.\nCompetent authorities may introduce temporary security measures in the event of an urgent problem significantly affecting the security of CIT operations.\nReview\nEvery 5 years, the Commission reports to the European Parliament and the Council on the regulation’s implementation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 29 November 2012.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nCommon EU rules for professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1214/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States (OJ L 316, 29.11.2011, pp. 1-20)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nApplicable transport arrangements in the euro-area Member States (Article 13(5)) and in Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican (Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States) (OJ C 139, 4.5.2017, pp. 14-23)\nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States pursuant to Article 26 of this regulation (COM(2017) 5 final, 11.1.2017)\nDirective 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (OJ L 18, 21.1.1997, pp. 1-6)\nlast update 01.03.2018", "tags": ["vocational training", "transport licence", "transport planning", "security of supply", "road safety", "road transport", "cross-border transport", "euro area", "euro"], "subjects": ["Economic and monetary policy", "Euro", "Free movement of capital"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
