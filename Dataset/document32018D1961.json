{"celex_id": "32018D1961", "reference": "12.12.2018\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 315/35\nCOMMISSION DECISION (EU) 2018/1961\nof 11 December 2018\nlaying down internal rules concerning the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their rights in the context of the processing of personal data for the purpose of internal audit activities\nTHE COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 249(1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) requires each Union institution to establish an internal audit function which shall be performed in compliance with the relevant international standards. Internal audit activities in the Commission are carried out by the Internal Audit Service (‘the Service’), which was established on 11 April 2000. Internal audit activities are also carried out by the Service in Union decentralised agencies and other autonomous bodies receiving contributions from the Union budget.\n(2)\nThe Service conducts internal audit activities in accordance with Articles 117 to 123 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 and its mission charter (2). In this respect, the Service has complete independence and full and unlimited access to all information required in the conduct of its internal audit activities in relation to all the activities and departments of the Union institution concerned.\n(3)\nThe Service advises other Commission departments, executive agencies, as well as Union decentralised agencies and other autonomous bodies receiving contributions from the Union budget on how to deal with risks, i.e. any event or issue that could occur and adversely impact the achievement of the Commission's political, strategic and operational objective, by issuing independent opinions on the quality of management and control systems and by issuing recommendations for improving the conditions of implementation of operations and promoting sound financial management, in accordance with Articles 117 to 123 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. Therefore, the internal audit activities of the Service do not typically target natural persons as such. Nevertheless, during the course of its activities, personal data within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) are inevitably processed. The internal audit activities carried out by the Service involve assessing the suitability and effectiveness of internal management systems and the performance of departments in implementing policies, programmes and actions, the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control and audit systems applicable to each budget implementation operation. Therefore, they contribute to the safeguarding of important economic and financial interests of the Union and of the Member States. The Service is a controller for the processing operations it carries out in accordance with Articles 118 and 119(2) of the Financial Regulation.\n(4)\nThe internal audit activities performed in the Commission and its executive agencies, and in the Union decentralised agencies and other autonomous bodies vary in form and content, ranging from assurance (including risk assessments) and consulting engagements, to reviews with a limited scope and follow-up engagements.\n(5)\nThe Audit Progress Committee (APC), in accordance with its Mission Charter updated on 21 November 2018 (C(2018)7707), is an advisory body (4) that assists the Commission in fulfilling its obligations under the Treaties and other statutory instruments [Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046] by ensuring the independence of the Internal Audit Service, by monitoring the quality of internal audit work, and by ensuring that internal and external audit recommendations are properly taken into account by the Commission services and that they receive appropriate follow-up. In this way, the APC contributes to the overall further improvement of the Commission's effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its goals and facilitates the College's oversight of the Commission's governance, risk management, and internal control practices. The APC is a controller for the processing operation(s) it carries out in accordance with Article 123 of the Financial Regulation.\n(6)\nFor the purpose of its activities under Articles 118 and 119(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, whether acting on its own initiative or on the basis of received input, the Commission processes personal data acquired or received from legal persons, natural persons, Member States and international bodies and organisations. During such internal audit activities, the Service may also process personal data acquired or received from publicly available sources, from anonymous or from identified sources that require protection of their identity.\n(7)\nThe Commission may, in turn, exchange personal data with the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, with competent authorities of Member States and, within the framework of the Commission relevant international or cooperation agreements, with third countries and international organisations.\n(8)\nPersonal data processing activities, within the meaning of Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, carried out in the course of an internal audit activity, may take place even before the Commission formally initiates it, continue throughout the performance of the audit activity and may continue even after the formal closure of the audit activity (for example, for reasons of monitoring of implementation of recommendations, assessing the need for initiating new internal audit activities).\n(9)\nThe categories of personal data processed by the Commission include identification data, contact data, professional data and data related to or brought in connection with the subject matter of the activity. These categories of personal data are stored in a secured electronic environment to prevent unlawful access or transfer of data to persons who do not have a need to know. The personal data are retained for a maximum period of ten years. At the end of the retention period, the information related to the internal audit activity, including personal data is transferred to the historical archives of the Commission (5) or destroyed.\n(10)\nWhile carrying out internal audit activities, the Commission is bound to respect the rights of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data recognised by Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and by Article 16(1) of the Treaty, as well as the rights provided for in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. At the same time, the Commission is required to comply with strict rules of confidentiality referred to in the international internal audit standards, in accordance with Article 117 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046.\n(11)\nIn certain circumstances, it is necessary to reconcile the rights of data subjects pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 with the needs of internal audit activities, and confidentiality of exchanges of information with natural and legal persons as well as with full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms of other data subjects. To that effect Article 25(1)(c), (g) and (h) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 provides the Service with the possibility to restrict the application of Articles 14 to 17, 19, 20 and 35, as well as the principle of transparency laid down in Article 4(1)(a), insofar as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles 14 to 17, 19, 20 and 35 of that Regulation.\n(12)\nIn order to ensure the effectiveness of internal audit activities, while respecting the standards of protection of personal data under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, which replaced Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), it is necessary to adopt internal rules under which the Commission may restrict data subjects' rights in accordance with Article 25(1)(c), (g) and (h) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.\n(13)\nThe internal rules should cover all processing operations carried out by the Commission in the performance of its internal audit activities, whether acting on its own initiative or on the basis of received input, whenever the exercise of data subjects' rights may jeopardise the conduct of internal audit activities. Those rules should apply to processing operations carried out prior to the formal initiation of an engagement, during the engagement as well as during the monitoring of the follow-up to its outcome.\n(14)\nIn order to comply with Articles 14, 15 and 16 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, the Commission should inform all individuals of its activities involving processing of their personal data and of their rights in a transparent and coherent manner by means of a data protection notice published on the Commission's website. Where relevant, the Commission should adduce additional safeguards to ensure that the data subjects are informed individually in an appropriate format.\n(15)\nOn the basis of Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, the Commission is also able to restrict the provision of information to data subjects and the exercise of other rights of data subjects in order to protect its own internal audit activities, audits of public authorities of the Member States, the audit tools and methods, as well as the rights of other persons related to its internal audit activities.\n(16)\nIn addition, in order to maintain effective cooperation it may be necessary for the Commission to restrict the application of data subjects' rights in order to protect processing operations of Commission services or other Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or of Member States' authorities and international organisations, as well as of the Audit Progress Committee. To that effect, the Commission should consult those services, institutions, bodies, offices, agencies, authorities and organisations, as well as the Audit Progress Committee on the relevant grounds for imposing restrictions and the necessity and proportionality of the restrictions.\n(17)\nThe Commission may also have to restrict the provision of information to data subjects and the application of other rights of data subjects in relation to personal data received from third countries or international organisations, in order to cooperate with those countries or organisations and thus safeguard an important objective of general public interest of the Union. However, in some circumstances the interest or fundamental rights of the data subject may override the interest of international cooperation.\n(18)\nThe Commission should handle all restrictions in a transparent manner and register each application of restrictions in the corresponding record system.\n(19)\nPursuant to Article 25(8) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, controllers may defer, omit or deny provision of information on the reasons for the application of a restriction to the data subject if providing that information would in any way compromise the purpose of the restriction. This is, in particular, the case of restrictions to the rights provided for in Articles 16 and 35 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.\n(20)\nWhere other rights of data subjects are restricted, the controller of the Internal Audit Service should assess on a case-by-case basis whether the communication of the restriction would compromise its purpose.\n(21)\nThe Data Protection Officer of the European Commission should carry out an independent review of the application of restrictions, with a view to ensuring compliance with this Decision.\n(22)\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1725 replaces Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, without any transitional period, from the date on which it enters into force. The possibility to apply restrictions to certain rights was provided for in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001. In order to avoid jeopardising the lawfulness of internal audit activities, this Decision should apply from the date of entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.\n(23)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor delivered an opinion on 27 November 2018,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nSubject-matter and scope\n1.   This Decision lays down the rules to be followed by the Commission to inform data subjects of the processing of their data in accordance with Articles 14, 15 and 16 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, when conducting its internal audit activities in accordance with Articles 117 to 123 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046.\nIt also lays down the conditions under which the Commission may restrict the application of Articles 4, 14 to 17, 19, 20 and 35 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in accordance with Article 25(1)(c), (g) and (h) of that Regulation.\n2.

rights — Commission’s internal rules\nRestrictions of data subjects’ rights — Commission’s internal rules\nSUMMARY OF:\nCommission Decision (EU) 2018/1927 — internal rules concerning the processing of personal data by the Commission in the field of competition in relation to the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain rights\nCommission Decision (EU) 2018/1961 — internal rules concerning the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their rights in the context of the processing of personal data for the purpose of internal audit activities\nCommission Decision (EU) 2018/1962 — internal rules concerning the processing of personal data by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in relation to the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their rights\nCommission Decision (EU) 2018/1996 — internal rules concerning the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their rights in the context of the processing of personal data for the purpose of trade defence and trade policy investigations\nCommission Decision (EU) 2019/154 — internal rules concerning the restriction of the right of access of data subjects to their medical files\nCommission Decision (EU) 2019/165 — internal rules concerning the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their data protection rights by the Commission in the context of administrative inquiries, pre-disciplinary, disciplinary and suspension proceedings\nCommission Decision (EU) 2019/236 — internal rules concerning the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their rights in the context of the processing of personal data by the Commission for the purposes of internal security of the EU institutions\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THESE DECISIONS?\n              \nThey set out internal rules, based on which the European Commission may restrict the rights of individuals, which they exercise under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. The internal rules apply to the processing of personal data within specific fields and for specific purposes.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nPersonal data are any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). A natural person is identifiable, if he/she can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier (such as a name, an identification number, location data, or an online identifier) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\nThe new EU legal framework on the protection and free flow of personal data consists of, in particular:\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets outs the rights of individuals as regards their personal data, protects them with regard to the processing of their personal data within the EU countries, and ensures the free flow of such data;\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1725, which sets out the rights of individuals as regards their personal data, protects them with regard to the processing of their personal data by the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and ensures the free flow of such data.\nThese regulations are considered as equivalent and have to be interpreted as being the same.\nArticle 25 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 provides for the possibility that, in certain cases, the EU institutions and bodies can restrict the rights of individuals, on the condition that such restrictions are laid down in EU law. In line with that, the Commission has adopted 7 Commission decisions, which provide the grounds for possible restrictions in order to safeguard important objectives of general EU public interest.\nBased on those decisions and following a case-by-case assessment of the necessity and proportionality of restrictions, the European Commission decides whether the rights of an individual should be restricted in an individual case.\nThe following rights of individuals may be restricted:\ntheir right to information about;processing of their personal data; andbreaches of their personal data that might result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms;\ntheir right to access their personal data, have their personal data erased, or to restrict the processing of their personal data.\nThe 7 Commission decisions all follow a similar format, each including some or all of these elements:\nSubject matter and scope\nRequirement of a case-by case assessment of each request of a data subject.\nApplicable exceptions and/or restrictions\nBefore applying a restriction, the Commission must first consider whether any of the exceptions to the rights of data subjects, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, apply.\nProvision of information to data subjects\nThe Commission must publish on its website data protection notices that inform all data subjects of its data processing activities in the relevant area.\nThe Commission must individually inform, in an appropriate format, any person individually affected by an inquiry or by a measure carried out in one of the relevant fields.\nRights of data subjects to access their personal data, have them erased or have their processing restricted\nIf the Commission restricts access to personal data, the right of erasure and/or right to restriction of processing, it must inform the data subject concerned of the restriction applied, of the main reasons for applying it and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with the European Data Protection Supervisor or of seeking a judicial remedy in the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nRecording and registering of restrictions\nThe Commission must record the reasons for any restriction applied, including an assessment of necessity and proportionality.\nDuration of restrictions\nRestrictions continue to apply as long as the reasons justifying them remain.\nReview by the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of the European Commission\nThe DPO must be informed, without undue delay, whenever data subjects’ rights are restricted.\nUpon request, the DPO must be provided with access to the record and any documents containing underlying factual and legal elements.\nThe DPO can request a review of the restriction and must be informed in writing of the outcome of the requested review.\nThe 7 Commission decisions cover the restriction of data subjects in the following fields:\nInternal security of the EU institutions\nApplies to the processing of personal data to ensure the security of persons, assets and information in the Commission.\nThe Commission must individually inform witnesses and the persons concerned by a security inquiry of the processing of their personal data.\nFurthermore, the Commission must individually inform data subjects whose data are processed in the case of background checks according to Article 7(5) of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/443.\nIt must also individually inform persons whose data are processed in the context of searches of Commission premises and communication and information systems and equipment.\nAdministrative inquiries, pre-disciplinary, disciplinary and suspension proceedings\nThe rights and obligations under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 can be restricted if they would jeopardise the purpose of administrative inquiries, pre-disciplinary, disciplinary and suspension proceedings or would affect the rights and freedoms of other data subjects.\nPersonal medical data\nThe Commission can restrict, on a case-by-case basis, data subjects’ right to access directly personal medical data of a psychological or psychiatric nature concerning them, where access to such data is likely to represent a risk to the data subject’s health.\nThis restriction must be proportionate to what is strictly necessary to protect the data subject.\nTrade defence and trade policy investigations\nThe rights and obligations under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 can be restricted if they would jeopardise the purpose of the Commission’s trade policy and trade defence activities, or would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other data subjects.\nEuropean Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)\nApplies to the processing of personal data by OLAF (as well as to the processing of personal data by Commission services and executive agencies which must be transmitted to OLAF) in order to fulfil its tasks;\nInvestigations by OLAF are completely independent of the Commission;\nOLAF decides whether any exceptions to the rights of data subjects should be applied.\nData protection notices informing data subjects of the activities involving the processing of their personal data are published on OLAF’s website.\nOLAF’s DPO reviews any restriction of the rights of data subjects.\nInternal audit activities\nThe rights and obligations under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 can be restricted as part of the processing operations carried out by the Commission in the performance of its internal audit activities, whenever the exercise of data subjects’ rights may jeopardise the conduct of internal audit activities, including by revealing its audit tools and methods or would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other data subjects.\nIn addition, it may be necessary for the Commission to restrict the application of data subjects’ rights in order to protect processing operations of Commission services or other Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or of
