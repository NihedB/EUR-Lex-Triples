Ownership, allocation and exercise of rights1. For purpose of this Annex \"intellectual property\" is defined in Article 2(c) of the Agreement.2. This Annex addresses the allocation of rights and interests of the Parties and their participants. Each Party and its participants shall ensure that the other Party and its participants may obtain the rights to intellectual property allocated to it in accordance with this Annex. This Annex does not otherwise alter or prejudice the allocation of rights, interests and royalties between a Party and its nationals or participants, and the rules of diffusion and utilisation of information, which will be determined by the laws and practices of each Party.3. The Parties will also be guided by, and contractual arrangements should provide for, the following principles:(a) effective protection of intellectual property. The Parties shall ensure that they and/or their participants notify one another within a reasonable time of the creation of any intellectual property arising under the Agreement or implementation arrangements and to seek protection for such intellectual property in a timely fashion;(b) effective exploitation of results, taking into account the contributions of the Parties and their participants;(c) non-discriminatory treatment of participants from the other Party as compared with the treatment given to its own participants, with regard to ownership, utilisation and dissemination of information and ownership, allocation and exercise of intellectual property rights;(d) protection of business-confidential information.4. The participants shall jointly develop a Technology Management Plan (TMP). TMP is a specific agreement to be concluded between the participants in joint research defining their respective rights and obligations, including those in respect of the ownership and use, including publication, of information and intellectual property to be created in the course of joint research.With respect to intellectual property (IP), the TMP will normally address, among other things, ownership, protection, user rights for research and development purposes, exploitation and dissemination, including arrangements for joint publication, the rights and obligations of visiting researchers and dispute settlement procedures. The TMP shall also address foreground and background information, licensing and deliverables. The TMP shall be developed within the rules and regulations in force in each Party taking into account the aims of the joint research, the relative financial or other contributions of the Parties and participants, the advantages and disadvantages of licensing by territory or for fields of use, requirements imposed by applicable laws, the need for dispute settlement procedures and other factors deemed appropriate by the participants. The rights and obligations concerning the research generated by visiting researchers (i.e. researchers not coming from a Party or a participant) in respect of IP shall also be addressed in the joint technology management plans. The TMP shall be approved by the responsible funding agency, or department of the Party involved in financing the research, before the conclusion of the specific research and development cooperation contracts to which they are attached.5. Information or intellectual property created in the course of joint research and not addressed in a TMP will be allocated according to the principles set out in the TMP. In the event of a disagreement which cannot be resolved by the agreed dispute settlement procedure, such information or IP shall be owned jointly by all the participants involved in the joint research from which the information or IP results. Each participant to whom this provision applies shall have the right to use such information or IP for his own commercial exploitation with no geographical limitation.6. In accordance with applicable laws, each Party will ensure that the other Party and its participants may have the rights to IP allocated to them.7. While maintaining the condition of competition in areas affected by the Agreement, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that rights acquired pursuant to the Agreement, and arrangements made under it, are exercised in such a way as to encourage, in particular(i) the dissemination and use of information created, disclosed or otherwise made available, under the Agreement, and(ii) the adoption and implementation of international standards.8. Termination or expiry of the Agreement will not affect rights or obligations of participants with regard to intellectual property under approved on-going projects in accordance with this Annex.II. Copyright works and scientific literary worksCopyright belonging to the Parties or to their participants shall be accorded treatment consistent with the Berne Convention (Paris Act 1971) and the TRIPS Agreement.Without prejudice to Section III, and unless otherwise agreed in the TMP, results of research shall be published jointly by the Parties or participants. Subject to the foregoing general rule, the following procedures shall apply:1. In the case of publication by a Party or public bodies of that Party of scientific and technical journals, articles, reports, books, including video and software arising from joint research pursuant to the Agreement, the other Party will be entitled to a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to translate, reproduce, adapt, transmit and publicly distribute such works.2. The Parties shall endeavour to disseminate literary works of a scientific character arising from joint research pursuant to the Agreement and published by independent publishers will be disseminated as widely as possible.3. All copies of a copyright work to be publicly distributed and prepared under this provision shall indicate the names of the author(s) of the work unless an author explicitly declines to be named. Copies shall also bear a clearly visible acknowledgement of the cooperative support of the Parties.III. Undisclosed informationA. Documentary undisclosed information1. Each Party, its agencies or its participants, as appropriate, shall identify at the earliest possible moment, and preferably in the TMP, the information that they wish to remain undisclosed in relation to the Agreement, taking into account inter alia the following criteria:(a) secrecy of the information in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration or assembly of its components, generally known among, or readily accessible by lawful means to, experts in the fields;(b) the actual or potential commercial value of the information by virtue of its secrecy;(c) previous protection of the information in the sense that it has been subject to steps that were reasonable under the circumstances by the person lawfully in control, to maintain its secrecy.The Parties and their participants may in certain cases agree that, unless otherwise indicated, parts or all of the information provided, exchanged or created in the course of joint research pursuant to the Agreement may not be disclosed.2. Each Party shall ensure that it and its participants clearly identify undisclosed information, for example by means of an appropriate marking or restrictive legend. This also applies to any reproduction of the said information, in whole or in part.A Party receiving undisclosed information pursuant to the Agreement will respect the privileged nature thereof. These limitations shall automatically terminate when this information is disclosed by the owner into the public domain.3. Undisclosed information communicated under this Agreement may be disseminated by the receiving Party to persons within or employed by the receiving Party and other concerned departments or agencies of the receiving Party authorised for the specific purposes of the joint research under way, provided that any undisclosed information so disseminated shall be pursuant to a written agreement of confidentiality and shall be readily recognisable as such, as set out above.4. With the prior written consent of the Party providing undisclosed information under this Agreement, the receiving Party may disseminate such undisclosed information more widely than otherwise permitted in paragraph 3. The Parties shall cooperate in developing procedures for requesting and obtaining prior written consent for such wider dissemination, and each Party will grant such approval to the extent permitted by its domestic policies, regulations and laws.B. Non-documentary undisclosed informationNon-documentary undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information provided in seminars and other meetings arranged under this Agreement, or information arising from the attachment of staff, use of facilities, or joint projects, shall be treated by the Parties or their participants according to the principles specified for documentary information in the Agreement; provided, however, that the recipient of such undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information has been made aware in advance and in written form of the confidential character of the information to be communicated.C. ControlEach Party shall endeavour to ensure that undisclosed information received by it under this Agreement is controlled as provided herein. If one of the Parties becomes aware that it will be, or may be reasonably expected to become, unable to meet the non-dissemination provisions of sections A and B, it shall immediately inform the other Party. The Parties will thereafter consult to define an appropriate course of action.", "summary": "Scientific and technological cooperation between the EU and India\nScientific and technological cooperation between the EU and India\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of India\nDecision 2002/648/EC on the conclusion of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Republic of India\nAgreement renewing the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of India\nDecision 2009/501/EC on the conclusion of an Agreement renewing the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Republic of India\nDecision (EU) 2015/1788 on the renewal of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of India\nDecision (EU) 2020/789 on the renewal of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of India\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISIONS?\nThe agreement establishes a formal framework for cooperation aiming at encouraging and facilitating activities in science and technology fields of common interest between the EU and India.\nThe 4 decisions concerned respectively the conclusion of the agreement (Decision 2002/648/EC) by which the Council approved the conclusion of the agreement on behalf of the European Community (now the EU), and its successive extension in 2009 (Decision 2009/501/EC), in 2015 (Decision (EU) 2015/1788) and in 2020 (Decision (EU) 2020/789).\nKEY POINTS\n              \nActivities conducted under the agreement are based on a number of principles:\nmutual benefit;\nreciprocal access to activities;\ntimely exchange of information;\nappropriate protection of intellectual property rights.\nFields of cooperation\nThe agreement covers all areas of research, technological development and demonstration (RTD).\nActivities\nCooperative activities may include the following:\nparticipation of Indian research entities in RTD projects under the EU Framework Programmes for research and innovation and reciprocal participation of EU-based entities in Indian projects in similar sectors;\njoint RTD projects;\nvisits and exchanges of scientists and technical experts;\njoint organisation of scientific seminars, conferences, symposia and workshops, as well as participation of experts in those activities;\nconcerted actions for dissemination of results/exchange of experience on joint RTD projects;\nexchanges and sharing of equipment and materials including shared use of advanced research facilities;\nexchanges of information on practices, laws, regulations and programmes relevant to cooperation under this agreement.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 14 October 2002 for an initial period of 5 years.
