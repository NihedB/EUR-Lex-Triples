However, the rapid development and use of new ICT should not lead to social exclusion or a widening of the digital divide; however, digital literacy is a precondition for inclusion and participation in the information society.\n(7)\nThe present initiative in the field of ambient assisted living should take into account the reality of the ageing population in Europe, where the percentage of women is higher than that of men due to the longer average life expectancy of women.\n(8)\nActive ageing is a core element in the renewed employment guidelines. The EU approach to ageing aims at mobilising the full potential of people of all ages — the lifecycle approach — and stresses the need to shift from fragmented to comprehensive ageing strategies.\n(9)\nAt present, a number of research and development programmes or activities undertaken by Member States individually at national level in the field of ICT for ageing well are not sufficiently coordinated at European level and do not allow a coherent approach at European level for research and development of innovative ICT-based products and services for ageing well.\n(10)\nWishing to have a coherent approach at European level in the field of ICT for ageing well and to act effectively, several Member States have taken the initiative in setting up a joint research and development programme entitled ‘Ambient Assisted Living’ (hereinafter referred to as the AAL Joint Programme) in the field of ICT for ageing well in the information society, in order to obtain synergies in terms of management and financial resources by ensuring a single common evaluation mechanism with the assistance of independent experts, on the basis of established practice as set out in Regulation (EC) No 1906/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 laying down the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in actions under the Seventh Framework Programme and for the dissemination of research results (2007-2013) (4), and the combination of additional expertise and resources available in various countries across Europe.\n(11)\nThe AAL Joint Programme aims at addressing the challenge of demographic ageing by providing the necessary legal and organisational framework for large-scale European cooperation between Member States in applied research and innovation in the area of ICT for ageing well in an ageing society. Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom (hereinafter referred to as the participating Member States) and Israel, Norway and Switzerland have agreed to coordinate and implement jointly activities aimed at contributing to the AAL Joint Programme. The overall value of their participation is estimated at a minimum of EUR 150 million for the duration of the Seventh Framework Programme. The participation of each of these countries in the AAL Joint Programme should be subject to a minimum financial contribution commensurate with the potential demand from its national research communities and should normally be at least EUR 0,2 million if the country is to participate in the annual work programme.\n(12)\nThe AAL Joint Programme should also promote the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in its activities in accordance with the objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme.\n(13)\nIn order to increase the impact of the AAL Joint Programme, the participating Member States, Israel, Norway and Switzerland have agreed to the Community’s participation in it. The Community should participate in the Programme by making a financial contribution of up to EUR 150 million. Given that the AAL Joint Programme meets the scientific objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme and that the research field of the AAL Joint Programme falls within the ICT theme of the Specific Programme ‘Cooperation’, the Community financial contribution should be taken from the budget appropriation allocated to that theme. Further financing options may be available, inter alia, from the European Investment Bank (EIB), in particular through the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility developed jointly by the EIB and the Commission pursuant to Annex III to Decision 2006/971/EC.\n(14)\nThe Community financial support should be provided subject to the definition of a financing plan based on formal commitments from the competent national authorities to implement jointly the research and development programmes and activities undertaken at national level and to contribute to the financing of the joint execution of the AAL Joint Programme.\n(15)\nThe joint implementation of the national research programmes requires the establishment or existence of a dedicated implementation structure, as provided for in the Specific Programme ‘Cooperation’.\n(16)\nThe participating Member States have agreed on such a dedicated implementation structure to implement the AAL Joint Programme.\n(17)\nThe dedicated implementation structure should be the recipient of the financial contribution from the Community and should ensure the efficient execution of the AAL Joint Programme.\n(18)\nIn order to implement the AAL Joint Programme efficiently, the dedicated implementation structure should grant financial support to third parties participating in the AAL Joint Programme which are selected following calls for proposals.\n(19)\nThe Community contribution should be subject to the commitment of resources by the participating Member States, Israel, Norway and Switzerland and the effective payment of their financial contributions.\n(20)\nThe Community should have the right to reduce, withhold or terminate its financial contribution if the AAL Joint Programme is implemented inadequately, partially or late, on the terms set out in an agreement to be concluded between the Community and the dedicated implementation structure laying down the detailed arrangements for the Community contribution.\n(21)\nAny Member State should be able to join the AAL Joint Programme.\n(22)\nIn accordance with the Seventh Framework Programme, the Community should have the right to agree conditions relating to its financial contribution to the AAL Joint Programme concerning the participation therein of any country associated with the Seventh Framework Programme or, where essential for implementing the AAL Joint Programme, of any other country, joining the Programme in the course of its implementation, in accordance with this Decision.\n(23)\nAppropriate measures should be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities’ financial interests (5), Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities (6), and Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (7).\n(24)\nIn accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (8) (hereinafter referred to as the Financial Regulation) and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (9) (hereinafter referred to as the Implementing Rules), the Community contribution should be managed in the framework of indirect centralised management in accordance with the provisions of Articles 54(2)(c) and 56 of the Financial Regulation, and Articles 35, 38(2) and 41 of the Implementing Rules.\n(25)\nIt is essential that the research activities carried out under the AAL Joint Programme conform to basic ethical principles, including those reflected in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and follow the principles of gender mainstreaming and gender equality. In the execution of the Programme account should also be taken of the promotion of the role of women in science and research.\n(26)\nThe AAL Joint Programme should also aim at promoting equitable and simplified access to relevant ICT-based products and services across all Member States.\n(27)\nThe Commission should conduct an interim evaluation by 2010, assessing the quality and efficiency of the implementation of the AAL Joint Programme and progress towards the objectives set. That evaluation should also assess the need for further interim evaluations to be conducted before the final evaluation at the end of 2013,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.

Specific aims\nThe AAL Joint Programme has the following specific aims:\n—\nfoster the emergence of innovative ICT-based products, services and systems for ageing well at home, in the community, and at work, thus improving the quality of life, autonomy, participation in social life, skills and employability of older people and reducing the costs of health and social care. This may be based, for example, on innovative utilisation of ICT, new methods of customer interaction or new types of value chains for independent living services. The results of the AAL Joint Programme could also be used by other groups of people, namely people with disabilities,\n—\ncreate a critical mass of research, development and innovation at EU level in the areas of technologies and services for ageing well in the information society, including the establishment of a favourable environment for the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Programme,\n—\nimprove conditions for the industrial exploitation of research results by providing a coherent European framework for developing common approaches, including common minimum standards and facilitating the localisation and adaptation of common solutions which are compatible with varying social preferences and regulatory aspects at national or regional level across Europe.\nBy focusing on applied research, the AAL Joint Programme will complement related longer-term research activities envisaged under the Seventh Framework Programme, as well as the demonstration activities forming part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007 to 2013) established by Decision No 1639/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), which focuses on large-scale uptake of existing solutions.\nThrough its activities, the AAL Joint Programme shall contribute to the achievement of the renewed Lisbon Strategy objectives and the knowledge-based society, while endeavouring to ensure that the use of new technologies does not lead to social exclusion. The Programme shall also promote the development of cost-effective solutions that can help to ensure equitable, simplified access to ICT products and services, including access to services through a choice of different channels that respect the privacy and dignity of the elderly in all regions of Europe, including rural and peripheral areas.\nMoreover, the AAL Joint Programme should promote innovation in and co-financing from the private sector, in particular SMEs, for market-related projects and the adaptation of technology and solutions developed under projects to the needs of the elderly, with a view to their increased social participation.\nWherever possible, complementarity and synergies between the AAL Joint Programme and other Community, national and regional programmes shall be ensured.\nDue account shall be taken of possible ethical and privacy issues, in line with international guidelines.\nII.   Activities\nThe main activity in the AAL Joint Programme consists of research, development and innovation activities. These are to be implemented via shared-cost transnational projects involving partners from at least three different countries from among the participating Member States, Israel, Norway and Switzerland and other participating countries addressing research, technological development, demonstration and dissemination activities. These should be targeted at market-oriented research, should be of short to medium-term duration and should demonstrate the capability to exploit the project results within a realistic time frame.\nIn addition, brokerage, programme promotion and networking activities may be implemented through dedicated events or in combination with existing events. These shall include the organisation of workshops and the establishment of contacts with other stakeholders in the value chain.\nThe AAL Joint Programme shall entail consultation with relevant European stakeholders (such as decision-makers from ministries and public sector authorities, private-sector service and insurance providers as well as industry, SMEs and user representatives) concerning the research priorities to be addressed and the implementation of the programme.\nThe AAL Joint Programme should also take into account demographic trends and demographic research in the various countries of Europe in order to provide solutions that reflect the social and economic situation across the Union.\nIII.   Programme implementation\nAnnual work programme and calls for proposals\nThe AAL Joint Programme shall be implemented on the basis of annual work programmes identifying topics for calls for proposals to be agreed with the Commission as a basis for the financial contribution from the Community.\nThe AAL Joint Programme shall issue regular calls for proposals in line with the agreed annual work programme. Proposals are submitted centrally to the dedicated implementation structure by the applicants (single entry point).\nAfter the closure of a call for proposals, a central eligibility check shall be carried out by the dedicated implementation structure in cooperation with the national programme management agencies. The check shall be performed on the basis of the common eligibility criteria for the AAL Joint Programme which shall be published with the annual work programme and shall include at least the following:\n—\ntimely, complete and electronic submission of the proposal, and\n—\nthe fulfilment of obligations concerning the composition of consortia.\nIn addition, the dedicated implementation structure shall, with the assistance of the national programme management agencies, check the fulfilment of national eligibility criteria published with the annual work programme and set out in the calls for proposals. The national eligibility criteria shall relate only to the legal and financial status of the individual applicants and not to the content of the proposal and shall cover:\n—\napplicant type, including legal status and purpose,\n—\nliability and viability, including financial soundness, fulfilment of fiscal and social obligations.\nEligible project proposals shall be evaluated and selected centrally with the assistance of independent experts, on the basis of transparent and common evaluation criteria, as set out in the work programme. This selection, once adopted by the General Assembly, shall be binding on the participating Member States, Israel, Norway and Switzerland.\nThe dedicated implementation structure shall be responsible for monitoring projects, and common operational procedures to manage the full project cycle shall be put in place.\nAs administrative matters concerning national project partners within the selected projects shall be handled by their national Programme Management Agency, national eligibility criteria strictly relating to the legal and financial status of individual participants, as specified above, as well as the national administrative principles shall be applied.\nWhere, at the contracting stage, a participant fails to meet one of the national eligibility criteria, the AAL Joint Programme shall safeguard scientific excellence. For this purpose, the Executive Board may decide that an additional central independent evaluation of the proposal concerned should be carried out with the assistance of independent experts, in order to evaluate the proposal without the participation of the participant in question or, if suggested by the project consortium, with a replacement participant.\nEach country shall finance its national participants whose proposals are successful through national agencies that shall additionally channel the central funding from the dedicated implementation structure, on the basis of an agreement to be concluded between the respective national agencies and their national participants for each project.\nEnsuring scientific, management and financial integration\nThe AAL Joint Programme shall ensure scientific integration of the participating national programmes by drawing up common work programmes and call topics across all the national programmes.\nManagement integration of the national programmes shall be ensured by the legal entity set up by the participating Member States and Israel, Norway and Switzerland. Management of the AAL Joint Programme shall include:\n—\ncentral organisation of the calls for proposals,\n—\ncentral, independent and transparent evaluation by experts at European level based on common rules and criteria for the evaluation and selection of the proposals on the basis of scientific excellence,\n—\nsingle submission address (electronic submission is envisaged).\nThe AAL Joint Programme shall strengthen financial integration by:\n—\nensuring overall national funding commitments for the duration of the initiative as well as annual commitments for each proposed work programme,\n—\nensuring that the final ranking of proposals agreed on the basis of the evaluation will be binding on the participating Member States, Israel, Norway and Switzerland as described above, including at the contracting stage,\n—\npromoting flexibility in national budget allocation as far as possible to handle exceptions, e.g. by increasing national contributions or cross-financing.\nEvery effort shall be made by the participating Member States to strengthen integration and remove existing national legal and administrative barriers for international cooperation as part of the initiative.\nIV.   Funding principles\nThe Community contribution shall represent a fixed percentage of the overall public funding from the participating national programmes, but shall in any case not exceed 50 % of the total public funding of a participant in a project selected following calls for proposals under the AAL Joint Programme. This fixed percentage shall be defined in the agreement between the dedicated implementation structure and the Commission and shall be based on the multiannual commitment of the participating Member States and Israel, Norway and Switzerland and the Community contribution.\nA maximum of 6 % of the Community financial contribution shall be used to contribute to the overall operational costs of the AAL Joint Programme.\nThe participating Member States, Israel, Norway and Switzerland shall also contribute to ensure the effective operation of the AAL Joint Programme.\nProjects shall be co-financed by the project participants.\nV.   Deliverables expected from the implementation of the AAL Joint Programme\nAn annual report shall be provided by the dedicated implementation structure, which shall give a detailed overview of the implementation of the AAL Joint Programme (number of projects submitted and selected for funding, use of the Community funding, distribution of national funds, types of participant, country statistics, brokerage events and dissemination activities, etc.) and progress towards further integration.\nThe deliverables expected shall be set out in greater detail in the agreement to be concluded between the Commission, on behalf of the Community, and the dedicated implementation structure.\n(1)  OJ L 310, 9.11.2006, p. 15.\nANNEX II\nGUIDELINES FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF THE AAL JOINT PROGRAMME\nThe organisational structure for the AAL Joint Programme is as follows:\nThe AAL Association, an international not-for-profit association established under Belgian law, constitutes the dedicated implementation structure created by the participating Member States and Israel, Norway and Switzerland.\nThe AAL Association is responsible for all the activities of the AAL Joint Programme.
