Provisions of Community law should be consistent with that Protocol with a view to its conclusion by the Community.\n(6)\nA European Pollutant Emission Register (hereinafter ‘EPER’) was established by Commission Decision 2000/479/EC (4). The Protocol builds on the same principles as EPER, but goes beyond, by including reporting on more pollutants, more activities, releases to land, releases from diffuse sources and off-site transfers.\n(7)\nThe objectives and goals pursued by a European PRTR can only be achieved if data are reliable and comparable. An adequate harmonisation of the data collection and transfer system is therefore needed to ensure the quality and comparability of data. In accordance with the Protocol the European PRTR should be designed for maximum ease of public access through the Internet. Releases and transfers should be easily identified in different aggregated and non-aggregated forms in order to access a maximum of information in a reasonable time.\n(8)\nIn order to further promote the objective of supporting the provision of accessible information to citizens on the state and trends of the environment as well as the general raising of environmental awareness, the European PRTR should contain links to other similar databases in Member States, non-Member States and international organisations.\n(9)\nIn accordance with the Protocol, the European PRTR should also contain information on specific waste disposal operations, to be reported as releases to land; recovery operations such as sludge and manure spreading are not reported under this category.\n(10)\nIn order to achieve the objective of the European PRTR to provide reliable information to the public and to allow for knowledge-based decisions it is necessary to provide for reasonable but strict timeframes for data collection and reporting; this is particularly relevant for reporting by Member States to the Commission.\n(11)\nReporting of releases from industrial facilities, although not yet always consistent, complete and comparable, is a well established procedure in many Member States. Where appropriate, reporting on releases from diffuse sources should be improved in order to enable decision-makers to better put into context those releases and to choose the most effective solution for pollution reduction.\n(12)\nData reported by the Member States should be of high quality in particular as regards their completeness, consistency and credibility. It is of great importance to coordinate future efforts of both operators and Member States to improve the quality of the reported data. The Commission will therefore initiate work, together with the Member States, on quality assurance.\n(13)\nIn accordance with the Aarhus Convention, the public should be granted access to the information contained in the European PRTR without an interest to be stated, primarily by ensuring that the European PRTR provides for direct electronic access through the Internet.\n(14)\nAccess to information provided by the European PRTR should be unrestricted and exceptions from this rule should only be possible where explicitly granted by existing Community legislation.\n(15)\nIn accordance with the Aarhus Convention, public participation should be ensured in the further development of the European PRTR by early and effective opportunities to submit comments, information, analysis or relevant opinions for the decision-making process. Applicants should be able to seek an administrative or judicial review of the acts or omissions of a public authority in relation to a request.\n(16)\nIn order to enhance the usefulness and impact of the European PRTR, the Commission and the Member States should cooperate in developing guidance supporting the implementation of the European PRTR, in promoting awareness of the public and in providing appropriate and timely technical assistance.\n(17)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (5).\n(18)\nSince the objective of the action to be taken, namely to enhance public access to environmental information through the establishment of an integrated, coherent Community-wide electronic database, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, because the need for comparability of data throughout the Member States argues for a high level of harmonisation, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(19)\nIn order to simplify and streamline reporting requirements, Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste (6) and Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (7) should be amended.\n(20)\nThe European PRTR aims, among other things, at informing the public about important pollutant emissions due, in particular, to activities covered by Directive 96/61/EC. Consequently, under this Regulation, information should be provided to the public on emissions from installations covered by Annex I of that Directive.\n(21)\nTo reduce duplicate reporting, pollutant release and transfer register systems may, under the Protocol, be integrated to the degree practicable with existing information sources such as reporting mechanisms under licences or operating permits. In accordance with the Protocol, the provisions of this Regulation should not affect the right of the Member States to maintain or introduce a more extensive or more publicly accessible pollutant release and transfer register than required under the Protocol,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes an integrated pollutant release and transfer register at Community level (hereinafter ‘the European PRTR’) in the form of a publicly accessible electronic database and lays down rules for its functioning, in order to implement the UNECE Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (hereinafter ‘the Protocol’) and facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making, as well as contributing to the prevention and reduction of pollution of the environment.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘the public’ means one or more natural or legal persons, and, in accordance with national legislation or practice, their associations, organisations or groups;\n(2)\n‘competent authority’ means the national authority or authorities, or any other competent body or bodies, designated by the Member States;\n(3)\n‘installation’ means a stationary technical unit where one or more activities listed in Annex I are carried out, and any other directly associated activities which have a technical connection with the activities carried out on that site and which could have an effect on emissions and pollution;\n(4)\n‘facility’ means one or more installations on the same site that are operated by the same natural or legal person;\n(5)\n‘site’ means the geographical location of the facility;\n(6)\n‘operator’ means any natural or legal person who operates or controls the facility or, where this is provided for in national legislation, to whom decisive economic power over the technical functioning of the facility has been delegated;\n(7)\n‘reporting year’ means the calendar year for which data on releases of pollutants and off-site transfers must be gathered;\n(8)\n‘substance’ means any chemical element and its compounds, with the exception of radioactive substances;\n(9)\n‘pollutant’ means a substance or a group of substances that may be harmful to the environment or to human health on account of its properties and of its introduction into the environment;\n(10)\n‘release’ means any introduction of pollutants into the environment as a result of any human activity, whether deliberate or accidental, routine or non-routine, including spilling, emitting, discharging, injecting, disposing or dumping, or through sewer systems without final waste-water treatment;\n(11)\n‘off-site transfer’ means the movement beyond the boundaries of a facility of waste destined for recovery or disposal and of pollutants in waste water destined for waste-water treatment;\n(12)\n‘diffuse sources’ means the many smaller or scattered sources from which pollutants may be released to land, air or water, whose combined impact on those media may be significant and for which it is impractical to collect reports from each individual source;\n(13)\n‘waste’ means any substance or object as defined in Article 1(a) of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste (8);\n(14)\n‘hazardous waste’ means any substance or object as defined in Article 1(4) of Directive 91/689/EEC;\n(15)\n‘waste water’ means urban, domestic and industrial waste water, as defined in Article 2(1), (2) and (3) of Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment (9), and any other used water which is subject, because of the substances or objects it contains, to regulation by Community law;\n(16)\n‘disposal’ means any of the operations provided for in Annex IIA to Directive 75/442/EEC;\n(17)\n‘recovery’ means any of the operations provided for in Annex IIB to Directive 75/442/EEC.\nArticle 3\nContent of the European PRTR\nThe European PRTR shall include information on:\n(a)\nreleases of pollutants referred to in Article 5(1)(a) that must be reported by the operators of the facilities carrying out the activities listed in Annex I;\n(b)\noff-site transfers of waste referred to in Article 5(1)(b) and of pollutants in waste water referred to in Article 5(1)(c), that must be reported by the operators of the facilities carrying out the activities listed in Annex I;\n(c)\nreleases of pollutants from diffuse sources referred to in Article 8(1), where available.\nArticle 4\nDesign and structure\n1.

Among other things, the amending regulation conferred powers on the European Commission to adopt implementing acts specifying the type, format and frequency of information to be reported under Regulation (EC) No 166/2006.\nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1741 introduced changes specific to the E-PRTR further to Regulation (EU) No 1010/2019.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe E-PRTR is available to the public free of charge on the internet. The information it contains can be searched using various criteria (type of pollutant, geographical location, affected environment, source facility, etc.).\nContent of the E-PRTR\nThe register contains information on releases of pollutants to air, water and land, as well as off-site transfers of pollutants present in waste-water and waste. The register covers 91 pollutants as listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006, including greenhouse gases, heavy metals, pesticides, and chlorinated organic substances.\nReleases are required to be reported when they exceed a certain threshold and originate from one of the 65 activities listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006. The majority of these activities are also regulated under Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (see summary) and comprise, in particular, the facilities covered by the following sectors: energy production,production and processing of metals,mineral industry,chemical industry,waste and wastewater management,paper and wood production and processing,intensive livestock production and aquaculture,animal and vegetable products from the food and beverage sector, andother activities e.g. producing textiles, leather tanning.\nWhere available, the register also provides information on releases from diffuse sources of air and diffuse sources of water.\nHow the E-PRTR works\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 requires: operators of each industrial facility to send their competent national authority information on their pollutant releases and transfers every year. This information covers pollutants to air, water and land, as well as off-site transfers of pollutants present in waste-water and waste;EU countries at national level to collate and check this information;national authorities to send this information by electronic transfer to the Commission within 11 months of the end of the reporting year;the Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency, to incorporate the information reported by the EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland into the E-PRTR within 1 month.\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2019/1741:\nspecifies the electronic format to be developed by EU countries for this reporting process, as well as the information to be supplied by EU countries;\nunless otherwise specified in the Annex to the decision, the information was to be first submitted for the reporting year 2019;\ninformation in Sections 1 to 4 of the Annex must reach the Commission, at the latest, by 30 September of the following reporting year;\ninformation in Sections 5 to 10 of the Annex must reach the Commission at the latest, by 30 November of the following reporting year;\nis to be reviewed by 31 December 2024 to assess the feasibility of progressing towards the objective of earlier public availability of E-PRTR data.\nThese amendments reduce from 16 months to 12 months the incorporation of the information reported by EU countries into the European PRTR, thus allowing the public more rapid access to this information.\nPublic participation\nThe regulation is a key instrument in delivering the requirements of the Aarhus convention as it provides the public with the opportunity to be involved in environmental decision making.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 24 February 2006.\nBACKGROUND\nThe E-PRTR was created following the adoption of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2003 Kyiv Protocol on pollutant release and transfer registers, signed by the EU in May 2003.\nDecision 2006/61/EC concludes the protocol, on behalf of the European Community (now the EU).\nFor more information, see:\nEuropean Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) (European Commission)\nProtocol on pollutant release and transfer registers (UNECE).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register and amending Council Directives 91/689/EEC and 96/61/EC (OJ L 33, 4.2.2006, pp. 1-17)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 have been incorporated in the original text.
