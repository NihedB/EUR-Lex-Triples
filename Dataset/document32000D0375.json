Within the framework of Decision No 276/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and in order to intensify measures to prevent and combat the production, processing, possession and distribution of child pornography material and to promote the effective investigation and prosecution of offences in this area, Member States shall take the necessary measures to encourage Internet users to inform law enforcement authorities, either directly or indirectly, on suspected distribution of child pornography material on the Internet, if they come across such material. Internet users shall be made aware of ways to make contact with law enforcement authorities or entities which have privileged links with law enforcement authorities, to enable such authorities to fulfil their task of preventing and combating child pornography on the Internet.2. Where necessary, and taking account of the administrative structure of each Member State, measures for the promotion of effective investigation and prosecution of offences in this area may be the setting-up of specialised units within law enforcement authorities with the necessary expertise and resources to be able to deal swiftly with information on suspected production, processing, distribution and possession of child pornography.3. Member States shall ensure that the law enforcement authorities act swiftly when they have received information on suspected production, processing, possession and distribution of child pornography material. Law enforcement authorities may defer taking action if and as long as tactically necessary, for instance with a view to getting at those behind the criminal operations, or at networks (child pornography rings).Article 21. Member States shall ensure the widest and speediest possible cooperation to facilitate an effective investigation and prosecution of offences concerning child pornography on the Internet in accordance with existing arrangements and agreements.2. To ensure a timely and effective response to these offences, Member States shall communicate already established points of contact, which are set up on a 24-hour basis and consist of knowledgeable personnel, as well as the specialised units which are referred to in Article 1(2) and which can be used for exchange of information and for further contacts between Member States. Points of contact, which Member States have already set up for other duties, may also be used for these purposes. Likewise, existing channels for communication, such as Europol and Interpol shall be used.3. Member States shall ensure that Europol, within the limits of its mandate, is informed of suspected cases of child pornography.4. Member States, in appropriate cooperation with Europol, shall examine the possibility of organising regular meetings of competent authorities specialising in combating child pornography on the Internet with a view to promoting general information exchanges, analysis of the situation and the coordination of measures in criminal tactics.5. Each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of its organisational unit or units acting as points of contact pursuant to paragraph 2. The General Secretariat shall inform all other Member States of these points of contact.Article 3Member States shall engage in constructive dialogue with industry and examine appropriate measures, of a voluntary or a legally binding nature, to eliminate child pornography on the Internet. In particular, Member States shall exchange experiences on the effectiveness of any measures they have taken to eliminate child pornography on the Internet. In this context, they shall examine the following measures, which would place Internet providers under a duty:(a) to advise the competent entities mentioned in Article 1 (1) or the units mentioned in Article 1(2) of child pornography material of which they have been informed or of which they are aware and which is distributed through them;(b) to withdraw from circulation child pornography material of which they have been informed or of which they are aware and which is distributed through them unless otherwise specified by the competent authorities;(c) in accordance with the Council resolution of 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications(14) to retain traffic-related data, where applicable and technically feasible - in particular for criminal prosecution purposes in cases of suspected sexual abuse of children, production, processing and distribution of child pornography - for such time as may be specified under the applicable national law, to allow the data to be made available for inspection by the criminal prosecution authorities in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure;(d) to set up their own control systems for combating the production, processing, possession and distribution of child pornography material.Article 4Member States shall regularly verify whether technological developments require, in order to maintain the efficiency of the fight against child pornography on the Internet, changes to criminal procedural law, while respecting the fundamental principles thereof and, where necessary, shall initiate appropriate new legislation to that end.Article 5Member States shall cooperate, in contact with industry, by sharing their experiences and encouraging, as far as possible, the production of filters and other technical means to prevent the distribution of child pornography material and to make possible the detection thereof.Article 61. The Council shall examine the extent to which Member States have fulfilled their obligations pursuant to Joint Action 97/154/JHA and the extent to which the measures proposed in this Decision have proved effective.2. The examination referred to in paragraph 1 shall be carried out under Joint Action 97/827/JHA adopted by the Council on 5 December 1997 establishing a mechanism for evaluating the application and implementation at national level of international undertakings in the fight against organised crime(15), subject to the following:(a) evaluation teams shall consist of two experts;(b) on-the-spot evaluation shall be made so as to avoid cumbersome procedures.3. The assessment specified in Title IV B of Joint Action 97/154/JHA shall not be carried out. It shall be replaced by the evaluation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.4. On the basis of the information received in the course of the evaluation pursuant to paragraph 2, the Council shall examine any further measure it may wish to take in order to make the combating of child pornography and sexual exploitation of children more effective.Article 7This Decision shall apply to Gibraltar.Article 8The measures contained in this Decision shall be implemented by the Member States at the latest on 31 December 2000.Done at Brussels, 29 May 2000.For the CouncilThe PresidentA.

However, it has become necessary to introduce a specific instrument to combat child pornography on the Internet in view of the scale on which this form of crime is being perpetrated.\nThe Member States will take measures:\nto encourage Internet users to inform law enforcement authorities if they suspect that child pornography material is being distributed on the Internet;\nto ensure that offences are investigated and punished by setting up specialised units within the law enforcement authorities, for example;\nto ensure that the law enforcement authorities react rapidly when they receive information on alleged cases of the production, processing, distribution and possession of child pornography.\nThe Member States also regularly verify whether, in the light of technological developments, their criminal law procedures should be amended with a view to combating child pornography on the Internet.\nIn order to facilitate cooperation between Member States, a list of 24-hour national contact points and specialised units will be disseminated. Europol will have to be informed of suspected cases of child pornography and meetings will be held between the national specialised services.\nThe Member States are to investigate all measures which could help to eliminate child pornography on the Internet and are to exchange information on best practice. They will also examine the possibility of placing Internet providers under an obligation to advise the competent authorities of child pornography material which is distributed through them, to withdraw such material from circulation, to retain such material in order to make it available to the authorities, and to set up their own control systems. In partnership with industry, Member States will encourage the production of filters and other technical means of preventing the distribution and facilitating the detection of such material.\nThe Council will organise on-the-spot visits to assess to what extent the Member States are complying with the obligations arising from the Council Decision.\nDepending on the results of these assessments, it will examine the need to adopt additional measures.\nReferences\nMeasure\nEntry into force - Expiry date\nDeadline for implementation in Member States\nOfficial Journal\nCouncil Decision of 29 May 2000\n29.5.2000\n31.12.2000\nOJ L 138 of 9.6.2000\nSee also\nFor supplementary information:\n\"Freedom, Security and Justice\" web page of the JFS Directorate-General of the European Commission:\nThe EU Action Plan against trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children\n\"Area of Freedom, Security and Justice\" web page of the European Parliament:\nFact Sheet: protection of children\nRELATED ACTS\nFramework Decision 2004/68/JHA\nof the Council of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.\nCommission communication\nto the Council and the European Parliament to combat the trafficking in human beings and to combat the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.\nLast updated: 20.12.2006", "tags": ["transmission network", "children's rights", "information technology", "pornography", "exchange of information", "child"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
