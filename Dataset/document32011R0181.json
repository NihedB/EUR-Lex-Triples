{"celex_id": "32011R0181", "reference": "28.2.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 55/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 181/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 February 2011\nconcerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 24 January 2011 (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nAction by the Union in the field of bus and coach transport should aim, among other things, at ensuring a high level of protection for passengers, that is comparable with other modes of transport, wherever they travel. Moreover, full account should be taken of the requirements of consumer protection in general.\n(2)\nSince the bus or coach passenger is the weaker party to the transport contract, all passengers should be granted a minimum level of protection.\n(3)\nUnion measures to improve passengers’ rights in the bus and coach transport sector should take account of the specific characteristics of this sector, which consists largely of small- and medium-sized undertakings.\n(4)\nPassengers and, as a minimum, persons whom the passenger had, or would have had, a legal duty to maintain should enjoy adequate protection in the event of accidents arising out of the use of the bus or coach, taking into account Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and the enforcement of the obligation to insure against such liability (3).\n(5)\nIn choosing the national law applicable to compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury as well as for loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents arising out of the use of the bus or coach, Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) (4) and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) (5) should be taken into account.\n(6)\nPassengers should, in addition to compensation in accordance with applicable national law in the event of death or personal injury or loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents arising out of the use of the bus or coach, be entitled to assistance with regard to their immediate practical needs following an accident. Such assistance should include, where necessary, first aid, accommodation, food, clothes and transport.\n(7)\nBus and coach passenger services should benefit citizens in general. Consequently, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, whether caused by disability, age or any other factor, should have opportunities for using bus and coach services that are comparable to those of other citizens. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility have the same rights as all other citizens with regard to free movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination.\n(8)\nIn the light of Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and in order to give disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility opportunities for bus and coach travel comparable to those of other citizens, rules for non-discrimination and assistance during their journey should be established. Those persons should therefore be accepted for carriage and not refused transport on the grounds of their disability or reduced mobility, except for reasons which are justified on the grounds of safety or of the design of vehicles or infrastructure. Within the framework of relevant legislation for the protection of workers, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility should enjoy the right to assistance at terminals and on board vehicles. In the interest of social inclusion, the persons concerned should receive the assistance free of charge. Carriers should establish access conditions, preferably using the European standardisation system.\n(9)\nIn deciding on the design of new terminals, and as part of major refurbishments, terminal managing bodies should endeavour to take into account the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, in accordance with ‘design for all’ requirements. In any case, terminal managing bodies should designate points where such persons can notify their arrival and need for assistance.\n(10)\nSimilarly, without prejudice to current or future legislation on technical requirements for buses and coaches, carriers should, where possible, take those needs into account when deciding on the equipment of new and newly refurbished vehicles.\n(11)\nMember States should endeavour to improve existing infrastructure where this is necessary to enable carriers to ensure access for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility as well as to provide appropriate assistance.\n(12)\nIn order to respond to the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, staff should be adequately trained. With a view to facilitating the mutual recognition of national qualifications of drivers, disability awareness training could be provided as a part of the initial qualification or periodic training as referred to in Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers (6). In order to ensure coherence between the introduction of the training requirements and the time-limits set out in that Directive, a possibility for exemption during a limited period of time should be allowed.\n(13)\nOrganisations representative of disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility should be consulted or involved in preparing the content of the disability-related training.\n(14)\nRights of bus and coach passengers should include the receipt of information regarding the service before and during the journey. All essential information provided to bus and coach passengers should also be provided, upon request, in alternative formats accessible to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, such as large print, plain language, Braille, electronic communications that can be accessed with adaptive technology, or audio tapes.\n(15)\nThis Regulation should not restrict the rights of carriers to seek compensation from any person, including third parties, in accordance with the applicable national law.\n(16)\nInconvenience experienced by passengers due to cancellation or significant delay of their journey should be reduced. To this end, passengers departing from terminals should be adequately looked after and informed in a way which is accessible to all passengers. Passengers should also be able to cancel their journey and have their tickets reimbursed or to continue their journey or to obtain re-routing under satisfactory conditions. If carriers fail to provide passengers with the necessary assistance, passengers should have the right to obtain financial compensation.\n(17)\nWith the involvement of stakeholders, professional associations and associations of customers, passengers, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, carriers should cooperate in order to adopt arrangements at national or European level. Such arrangements should aim at improving the information, care and assistance offered to passengers whenever their travel is interrupted, in particular in the event of long delays or cancellation of travel, with a particular focus on passengers with special needs due to disability, reduced mobility, illness, elderly age and pregnancy, and including accompanying passengers and passengers travelling with young children. National enforcement bodies should be informed of those arrangements.\n(18)\nThis Regulation should not affect the rights of passengers established by Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours (7). This Regulation should not apply in cases where a package tour is cancelled for reasons other than cancellation of the bus or coach transport service.\n(19)\nPassengers should be fully informed of their rights under this Regulation, so that they can effectively exercise those rights.\n(20)\nPassengers should be able to exercise their rights by means of appropriate complaint procedures implemented by carriers or, as the case may be, by submission of complaints to the body or bodies designated to that end by the relevant Member State.\n(21)\nMember States should ensure compliance with this Regulation and designate a competent body or bodies to carry out supervision and enforcement tasks. This does not affect the rights of passengers to seek legal redress from courts under national law.\n(22)\nTaking into account the procedures established by Member States for the submission of complaints, a complaint concerning assistance should preferably be addressed to the body or bodies designated for the enforcement of this Regulation in the Member State where the boarding point or alighting point is situated.\n(23)\nMember States should promote the use of public transport and the use of integrated information and integrated tickets in order to optimise the use and interoperability of the various transport modes and operators.\n(24)\nMember States should lay down penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those penalties are applied. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(25)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of and assistance to passengers in bus and coach transport throughout the Member States, cannot sufficiently be achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(26)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (8).\n(27)\nThe enforcement of this Regulation should be based on Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection law (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation) (9). That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(28)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as referred to in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, bearing in mind also Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (10) and Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services (11),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes rules for bus and coach transport as regards the following:\n(a)\nnon-discrimination between passengers with regard to transport conditions offered by carriers;\n(b)\nrights of passengers in the event of accidents arising out of the use of the bus or coach resulting in death or personal injury or loss of or damage to luggage;\n(c)\nnon-discrimination and mandatory assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility;\n(d)\nrights of passengers in cases of cancellation or delay;\n(e)\nminimum information to be provided to passengers;\n(f)\nhandling of complaints;\n(g)\ngeneral rules on enforcement.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to passengers travelling with regular services for non-specified categories of passengers where the boarding or the alighting point of the passengers is situated in the territory of a Member State and where the scheduled distance of the service is 250 km or more.\n2.   As regards the services referred to in paragraph 1 but where the scheduled distance of the service is shorter than 250 km, Article 4(2), Article 9, Article 10(1), point (b) of Article 16(1), Article 16(2), Article 17(1) and (2), and Articles 24 to 28 shall apply.\n3.   In addition, with the exception of Articles 9 to 16, Article 17(3), and Chapters IV, V and VI, this Regulation shall apply to passengers travelling with occasional services where the initial boarding point or the final alighting point of the passenger is situated in the territory of a Member State.\n4.   With the exception of Article 4(2), Article 9, Article 10(1), point (b) of Article 16(1), Article 16(2), Article 17(1) and (2), and Articles 24 to 28, Member States may, on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis, exempt domestic regular services from the application of this Regulation. Such exemptions may be granted as from the date of application of this Regulation for a period no longer than 4 years, which may be renewed once.\n5.   For a maximum period of 4 years from the date of application of this Regulation, Member States may, on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis, exempt from the application of this Regulation particular regular services because a significant part of such regular services, including at least one scheduled stop, is operated outside the Union. Such exemptions may be renewed once.\n6.   Member States shall inform the Commission of exemptions of different types of services granted pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5. The Commission shall take appropriate action if such an exemption is deemed not to be in accordance with the provisions of this Article. By 2 March 2018, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on exemptions granted pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5.\n7.   Nothing in this Regulation shall be understood as conflicting with or introducing additional requirements to those in current legislation on technical requirements for buses or coaches or infrastructure or equipment at bus stops and terminals.\n8.   This Regulation shall not affect the rights of passengers under Directive 90/314/EEC and shall not apply in case where a package tour referred to in that Directive is cancelled for reasons other than cancellation of a regular service.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘regular services’ means services which provide for the carriage of passengers by bus or coach at specified intervals along specified routes, passengers being picked up and set down at predetermined stopping points;\n(b)\n‘occasional services’ means services which do not fall within the definition of regular services and the main characteristic of which is the carriage by bus or coach of groups of passengers constituted on the initiative of the customer or the carrier himself;\n(c)\n‘transport contract’ means a contract of carriage between a carrier and a passenger for the provision of one or more regular or occasional services;\n(d)\n‘ticket’ means a valid document or other evidence of a transport contract;\n(e)\n‘carrier’ means a natural or legal person, other than a tour operator, travel agent or ticket vendor, offering transport by regular or occasional services to the general public;\n(f)\n‘performing carrier’ means a natural or legal person other than the carrier, who actually performs the carriage wholly or partially;\n(g)\n‘ticket vendor’ means any intermediary concluding transport contracts on behalf of a carrier;\n(h)\n‘travel agent’ means any intermediary acting on behalf of a passenger for the conclusion of transport contracts;\n(i)\n‘tour operator’ means an organiser or retailer, other than the carrier, within the meaning of Article 2(2) and (3) of Directive 90/314/EEC;\n(j)\n‘disabled person’ or ‘person with reduced mobility’ means any person whose mobility when using transport is reduced as a result of any physical disability (sensory or locomotory, permanent or temporary), intellectual disability or impairment, or any other cause of disability, or as a result of age, and whose situation needs appropriate attention and adaptation to his particular needs of the services made available to all passengers;\n(k)\n‘access conditions’ means relevant standards, guidelines and information on the accessibility of buses and/or of designated terminals including their facilities for disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility;\n(l)\n‘reservation’ means a booking of a seat on board a bus or coach for a regular service at a specific departure time;\n(m)\n‘terminal’ means a staffed terminal where according to the specified route a regular service is scheduled to stop for passengers to board or alight, equipped with facilities such as a check-in counter, waiting room or ticket office;\n(n)\n‘bus stop’ means any point other than a terminal where according to the specified route a regular service is scheduled to stop for passengers to board or alight;\n(o)\n‘terminal managing body’ means an organisational entity in a Member State responsible for the management of a designated terminal;\n(p)\n‘cancellation’ means the non-operation of a regular service which was previously scheduled;\n(q)\n‘delay’ means a difference between the time the regular service was scheduled to depart in accordance with the published timetable and the time of its actual departure.\nArticle 4\nTickets and non-discriminatory contract conditions\n1.

Such assistance shall include, where necessary, accommodation, food, clothes, transport and the facilitation of first aid. Any assistance provided shall not constitute recognition of liability.\nFor each passenger, the carrier may limit the total cost of accommodation to EUR 80 per night and for a maximum of 2 nights.\nCHAPTER III\nRIGHTS OF DISABLED PERSONS AND PERSONS WITH REDUCED MOBILITY\nArticle 9\nRight to transport\n1.

Notwithstanding Article 9(1), carriers, travel agents and tour operators may refuse to accept a reservation from, to issue or otherwise provide a ticket to, or to take on board, a person on the grounds of disability or of reduced mobility:\n(a)\nin order to meet applicable safety requirements established by international, Union or national law, or in order to meet health and safety requirements established by the competent authorities;\n(b)\nwhere the design of the vehicle or the infrastructure, including bus stops and terminals, makes it physically impossible to take on board, alight or carry the disabled person or person with reduced mobility in a safe and operationally feasible manner.\n2.   In the event of a refusal to accept a reservation or to issue or otherwise provide a ticket on the grounds referred to in paragraph 1, carriers, travel agents and tour operators shall inform the person concerned about any acceptable alternative service operated by the carrier.\n3.   If a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility, who holds a reservation or has a ticket and has complied with the requirements of point (a) of Article 14(1), is nonetheless refused permission to board on the grounds of his disability or reduced mobility, that person and any accompanying person pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article shall be offered the choice between:\n(a)\nthe right to reimbursement, and where relevant a return service free of charge to the first point of departure, as set out in the transport contract, at the earliest opportunity; and\n(b)\nexcept where not feasible, continuation of the journey or re-routing by reasonable alternative transport services to the place of destination set out in the transport contract.\nThe right to reimbursement of the money paid for the ticket shall not be affected by the failure to notify in accordance with point (a) of Article 14(1).\n4.   If a carrier, travel agent or tour operator refuses to accept a reservation from, to issue or otherwise provide a ticket to, or to take on board, a person on the grounds of disability or of reduced mobility for the reasons set out in paragraph 1, that person may request to be accompanied by another person of his own choosing who is capable of providing the assistance required by the disabled person or person with reduced mobility in order that the reasons set out in paragraph 1 no longer apply.\nSuch an accompanying person shall be transported free of charge and, where feasible, seated next to the disabled person or person with reduced mobility.\n5.   When carriers, travel agents or tour operators have recourse to paragraph 1, they shall immediately inform the disabled person or person with reduced mobility of the reasons therefor, and, upon request, inform the person in question in writing within 5 working days of the request.\nArticle 11\nAccessibility and information\n1.   In cooperation with organisations representative of disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility, carriers and terminal managing bodies shall, where appropriate through their organisations, establish, or have in place, non-discriminatory access conditions for the transport of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.\n2.   The access conditions provided for in paragraph 1, including the text of international, Union or national laws establishing the safety requirements, on which these non-discriminatory access conditions are based, shall be made publicly available by carriers and terminal managing bodies physically or on the Internet, in accessible formats on request, in the same languages as those in which information is generally made available to all passengers. When providing this information particular attention shall be paid to the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.\n3.   Tour operators shall make available the access conditions provided for in paragraph 1 which apply to journeys included in package travel, package holidays and package tours which they organise, sell or offer for sale.\n4.

In addition to paragraph 1, disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility shall notify the carrier, travel agent or tour operator at the time of reservation or advance purchase of the ticket of their specific seating needs, provided that the need is known at that time.\n3.   Carriers, terminal managing bodies, travel agents and tour operators shall take all measures necessary to facilitate the receipt of notifications of the need for assistance made by disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility. This obligation shall apply at all designated terminals and their points of sale including sale by telephone and via the Internet.\n4.   If no notification is made in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2, carriers, terminal managing bodies, travel agents and tour operators shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that the assistance is provided in such a way that the disabled person or person with reduced mobility is able to board the departing service, to change to the corresponding service or to alight from the arriving service for which he has purchased a ticket.\n5.   The terminal managing body shall designate a point inside or outside the terminal at which disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility can announce their arrival and request assistance. The point shall be clearly signposted and shall offer basic information about the terminal and assistance provided, in accessible formats.\nArticle 15\nTransmission of information to a third party\nIf travel agents or tour operators receive a notification referred to in point (a) of Article 14(1) they shall, within their normal office hours, transfer the information to the carrier or terminal managing body as soon as possible.\nArticle 16\nTraining\n1.   Carriers and, where appropriate, terminal managing bodies shall establish disability-related training procedures, including instructions, and ensure that:\n(a)\ntheir personnel, other than drivers, including those employed by any other performing party, providing direct assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility are trained or instructed as described in parts (a) and (b) of Annex II; and\n(b)\ntheir personnel, including drivers, who deal directly with the travelling public or with issues related to the travelling public, are trained or instructed as described in part (a) of Annex II.\n2.   A Member State may for a maximum period of 5 years from 1 March 2013 grant an exemption from the application of point (b) of paragraph 1 with regard to training of drivers.\nArticle 17\nCompensation in respect of wheelchairs and other mobility equipment\n1.   Carriers and terminal managing bodies shall be liable where they have caused loss of or damage to wheelchairs, other mobility equipment or assistive devices. The loss or damage shall be compensated by the carrier or terminal managing body liable for that loss or damage.\n2.   The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equal to the cost of replacement or repair of the equipment or devices lost or damaged.\n3.   Where necessary, every effort shall be undertaken to rapidly provide temporary replacement equipment or devices. The wheelchairs, other mobility equipment or assistive devices shall, where possible, have technical and functional features similar to those lost or damaged.\nArticle 18\nExemptions\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 2(2), Member States may exempt domestic regular services from the application of all or some of the provisions of this Chapter, provided that they ensure that the level of protection of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility under their national rules is at least the same as under this Regulation.\n2.   Member States shall inform the Commission of exemptions granted pursuant to paragraph 1. The Commission shall take appropriate action if such an exemption is deemed not to be in accordance with the provisions of this Article. By 2 March 2018, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on exemptions granted pursuant to paragraph 1.\nCHAPTER IV\nPASSENGER RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF CANCELLATION OR DELAY\nArticle 19\nContinuation, re-routing and reimbursement\n1.   Where a carrier reasonably expects a regular service to be cancelled or delayed in departure from a terminal for more than 120 minutes or in the case of overbooking, the passenger shall immediately be offered the choice between:\n(a)\ncontinuation or re-routing to the final destination, at no additional cost and under comparable conditions, as set out in the transport contract, at the earliest opportunity;\n(b)\nreimbursement of the ticket price, and, where relevant, a return service by bus or coach free of charge to the first point of departure, as set out in the transport contract, at the earliest opportunity.\n2.   If the carrier fails to offer the passenger the choice referred to in paragraph 1, the passenger shall have the right to compensation amounting to 50 % of the ticket price, in addition to the reimbursement referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1. This sum shall be paid by the carrier within 1 month after the submission of the request for compensation.\n3.   Where the bus or coach becomes inoperable during the journey, the carrier shall provide either the continuation of the service with another vehicle from the location of the inoperable vehicle, or transport from the location of the inoperable vehicle to a suitable waiting point or terminal from where continuation of the journey becomes possible.\n4.   Where a regular service is cancelled or delayed in departure from a bus stop for more than 120 minutes, passengers shall have the right to the continuation or re-routing or reimbursement of the ticket price from the carrier, as referred to in paragraph 1.\n5.   The payment of reimbursement provided for in point (b) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 4 shall be made within 14 days after the offer has been made or request has been received. The payment shall cover the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was purchased, for the part or parts of the journey not made, and for the part or parts already made if the journey no longer serves any purpose in relation to the passenger’s original travel plan. In case of travel passes or season tickets the payment shall be equal to its proportional part of the full cost of the pass or ticket. The reimbursement shall be paid in money, unless the passenger accepts another form of reimbursement.\nArticle 20\nInformation\n1.   In the event of cancellation or delay in departure of a regular service, passengers departing from terminals shall be informed by the carrier or, where appropriate, the terminal managing body, of the situation as soon as possible and in any event no later than 30 minutes after the scheduled departure time, and of the estimated departure time as soon as this information is available.\n2.   If passengers miss, according to the timetable, a connecting service due to a cancellation or delay, the carrier or, where appropriate, the terminal managing body, shall make reasonable efforts to inform the passengers concerned of alternative connections.\n3.   The carrier or, where appropriate, the terminal managing body, shall ensure that disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility receive the information required under paragraphs 1 and 2 in accessible formats.\n4.   Where feasible, the information required under paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be provided by electronic means to all passengers, including those departing from bus stops, within the time-limit stipulated in paragraph 1, if the passenger has requested this and has provided the necessary contact details to the carrier.\nArticle 21\nAssistance in case of cancelled or delayed departures\nFor a journey of a scheduled duration of more than 3 hours the carrier shall, in case of cancellation or delay in departure from a terminal of more than 90 minutes, offer the passenger free of charge:\n(a)\nsnacks, meals or refreshments in reasonable relation to the waiting time or delay, provided they are available on the bus or in the terminal, or can reasonably be supplied;\n(b)\na hotel room or other accommodation as well as assistance to arrange transport between the terminal and the place of accommodation in cases where a stay of 1 or more nights becomes necessary. For each passenger, the carrier may limit the total cost of accommodation, not including transport to and from the terminal and place of accommodation, to EUR 80 per night and for a maximum of 2 nights.\nIn applying this Article the carrier shall pay particular attention to the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility and any accompanying persons.\nArticle 22\nFurther claims\nNothing in this Chapter shall preclude passengers from seeking damages in accordance with national law before national courts in respect of loss resulting from cancellation or delay of regular services.\nArticle 23\nExemptions\n1.   Articles 19 and 21 shall not apply to passengers with open tickets as long as the time of departure is not specified, except for passengers holding a travel pass or a season ticket.\n2.   Point (b) of Article 21 shall not apply where the carrier proves that the cancellation or delay is caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters endangering the safe operation of bus or coach services.\nCHAPTER V\nGENERAL RULES ON INFORMATION AND COMPLAINTS\nArticle 24\nRight to travel information\nCarriers and terminal managing bodies shall, within their respective areas of competence, provide passengers with adequate information throughout their travel. Where feasible, this information shall be provided in accessible formats upon request.\nArticle 25\nInformation on passenger rights\n1.   Carriers and terminal managing bodies shall, within their respective areas of competence, ensure that passengers are provided with appropriate and comprehensible information regarding their rights under this Regulation at the latest on departure. This information shall be provided at terminals and where applicable, on the Internet.
