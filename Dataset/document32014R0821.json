In order to ensure implementation of the programmes financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds (the ‘ESI Funds’), it is necessary to lay down further provisions for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. To facilitate a comprehensive view and the access to those provisions, those provisions should be set out in one implementing act.\n(2)\nTo increase flexibility in mobilising support for financial instruments from different sources managed by the managing authority in one of the ways set out in the first subparagraph of Article 38(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, it is necessary to clarify how the programme contributions are transferred and managed. In particular it is necessary to clarify the circumstances under which a financial instrument may receive contributions from more than one programme or from more than one priority axis or measure of the same programme, and the conditions under which national public or private contributions to financial instruments made at the level of final recipients can be taken into consideration as national co-financing resources.\n(3)\nIt is necessary to establish a model for reporting on financial instruments to the Commission in order to ensure that the managing authorities provide the information required by Article 46(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 in a consistent and comparable way. The model for reporting on financial instruments is also necessary to enable the Commission to provide summaries of the data on progress made in financing and implementing the financial instruments.\n(4)\nIn order to ensure a harmonised visual identity for information and communication measures for operations in the area of Union cohesion policy, the instructions for creating the Union emblem and a definition of the standard colours should be established, as well as technical characteristics for displaying the Union emblem and the reference to the Fund or Funds supporting the operation.\n(5)\nIn order to ensure a harmonised visual identity for information and communication measures for infrastructure and construction operations in the area of Union cohesion policy, it is necessary to establish the technical characteristics of billboards and permanent plaques for infrastructure and construction operations where the total public support for each operation exceeds EUR 500 000.\n(6)\nFor the purposes of Article 125(2)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, it is necessary to lay down technical specifications of the system to record and store in computerised form data on each operation necessary for the monitoring, evaluation, financial management, verification and audit.\n(7)\nFor the purposes of effective implementation of the second subparagraph of Article 122(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, it is necessary to ensure that the technical specifications of the system to record and store data guarantee full interoperability with the system referred to in Article 122(3) of that Regulation, at architectural, technical and semantic level.\n(8)\nThe detailed technical specifications of the system to record and store data should be sufficiently documented to ensure audit trail of the compliance with the legal requirements.\n(9)\nThe system to record and store data should also include appropriate search tools and reporting functions in order to be able to easily retrieve and aggregate information stored in it for monitoring, evaluation, financial management, verification and audit purposes.\n(10)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Coordination Committee for the European Structural and Investment Funds,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nDETAILED ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE TRANSFER AND MANAGEMENT OF PROGRAMME CONTRIBUTIONS AND REPORTING ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nArticle 1\nTransfer and management of programme contributions\n(Article 38(10) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013)\n1.

Twelve gold stars situated at equal intervals form an invisible circle whose center is the point of intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle. The radius of the circle is equal to one third of the height of the hoist. Each of the stars has five points which are situated on the circumference of an invisible circle whose radius is equal to one eighteenth of the height of the hoist.
