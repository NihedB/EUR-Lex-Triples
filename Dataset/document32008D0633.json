{"celex_id": "32008D0633", "reference": "13.8.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 218/129\nCOUNCIL DECISION 2008/633/JHA\nof 23 June 2008\nconcerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 30(1)(b) and Article 34(2)(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) (1) established the VIS as a system for the exchange of visa data between Member States. The establishment of the VIS represents one of the key initiatives within the policies of the European Union aimed at establishing an area of freedom, security and justice. The VIS should have the purpose of improving the implementation of the common visa policy and should also contribute towards internal security and to combating terrorism under clearly defined and monitored circumstances.\n(2)\nDuring its meeting of 7 March 2005 the Council adopted conclusions stating that ‘in order to achieve fully the aim of improving internal security and the fight against terrorism’, Member State authorities responsible for internal security should be guaranteed access to the VIS, ‘in the course of their duties in relation to the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences, including terrorist acts and threats’, ‘subject to strict compliance with the rules governing the protection of personal data’.\n(3)\nIt is essential in the fight against terrorism and other serious crimes for the relevant services to have the fullest and most up-to-date information in their respective fields. The Member States' competent national services need information if they are to perform their tasks. The information contained in the VIS may be necessary for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and serious crimes and should therefore be available, subject to the conditions set out in this Decision, for consultation by the designated authorities.\n(4)\nMoreover, the European Council has stated that Europol has a key role with respect to cooperation between Member States' authorities in the field of cross-border crime investigation in supporting Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigation. Consequently, Europol should also have access to VIS data within the framework of its tasks and in accordance with the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the Establishment of a European Police Office (2).\n(5)\nThis Decision complements Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on 7 stay-visas (VIS Regulation) (3) insofar as it provides for a legal base under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union authorising access to the VIS for designated authorities and for Europol.\n(6)\nIt is necessary to designate the competent Member States' authorities as well as the central access points through which access is done and to keep a list of the operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to access the VIS for the specific purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences as referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (4). It is essential to ensure that the duly empowered staff with a right to access the VIS is limited to those who ‘have a need to know’ and possess appropriate knowledge about data security and data protection rules.\n(7)\nRequests for access to the VIS should be made by the operating units within the designated authorities to the central access points. These central access points should then process the requests for access to the VIS following a verification whether all conditions for access are fulfilled. In an exceptional case of urgency the central access points should process the request immediately and only do the verification afterwards.\n(8)\nFor the purposes of protection of personal data, and in particular to exclude routine access, the processing of VIS data should only be on a case-by-case basis. Such a specific case exists in particular when the access for consultation is connected to a specific event or to a danger associated with serious crime, or to (a) specific person(s) in respect of whom there are serious grounds for believing that the person(s) will commit or has (have) committed terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences or that the person(s) has (have) a relevant connection with such (a) person(s). The designated authorities and Europol should thus only search data contained in the VIS when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such a search will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating serious crime.\n(9)\nOnce the proposed Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has entered into force it should apply to the personal data which are processed pursuant to this Decision. However, until the rules set out in that Framework Decision are applicable and in order to supplement them, adequate provisions have to be provided for to ensure the necessary data protection. Each Member State should ensure an adequate data protection level in its national law which at least corresponds to that resulting from the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data and the corresponding case law pursuant to Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and, for those Member States which have ratified it, the Additional Protocol of 8 November 2001 to that Convention, and should take into account Recommendation No R (87) 15 of 17 September 1987 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe Regulating the Use of Personal Data in the Police Sector.\n(10)\nThe effective monitoring of the application of this Decision should be evaluated at regular intervals.\n(11)\nSince the objectives of this Decision, namely the creation of obligations and conditions for access for consultation of VIS data by Member States' designated authorities and by Europol, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at the level of the European Union, the Council may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union and defined in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(12)\nIn accordance with Article 47 of the Treaty on European Union, this Decision does not affect the competences of the European Community, in particular as exercised in Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (5).\n(13)\nThis Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (6). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(14)\nThis Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (7). Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(15)\nHowever, in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA of 18 December 2006 on simplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States of the European Union (8), information contained in the VIS can be provided to the United Kingdom and Ireland by the competent authorities of the Member States whose designated authorities have access to the VIS pursuant to this Decision. Information held in the national visa registers of the United Kingdom and Ireland can be provided to the competent law enforcement authorities of the other Member States. Any form of direct access for central authorities of the United Kingdom and Ireland to the VIS would, under the present state of their participation in the Schengen acquis, require an agreement between the Community and those Member States, possibly to be supplemented by other rules specifying the conditions and procedures for such access.\n(16)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes, with the exception of Article 7, a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (9) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (10) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(17)\nAs regards Switzerland, this Decision constitutes, with the exception of Article 7, a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of Council Decision 2004/849/EC (11).\n(18)\nThis Decision, save Article 6, constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession.\n(19)\nThis Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles reflected in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\nThis Decision lays down the conditions under which Member States' designated authorities and the European Police Office (Europol) may obtain access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘Visa Information System (VIS)’ means the Visa Information System as established by Decision 2004/512/EC;\n(b)\n‘Europol’ means the European Police Office as established by the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the Establishment of a European Police Office (the Europol Convention);\n(c)\n‘terrorist offences’ means the offences under national law which correspond or are equivalent to the offences in Articles 1 to 4 of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism (12);\n(d)\n‘serious criminal offences’ means the forms of crime which correspond or are equivalent to those referred to in Article 2(2) of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA;\n(e)\n‘designated authorities’ means authorities which are responsible for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences and designated by the Member States pursuant to Article 3.\n2.

It consists of a central IT system and a communication infrastructure that links this central system to national systems.\nThe decision allows the VIS to be used to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences.\nIt enables designated law enforcement authorities (such as authorities responsible for tackling terrorism or serious criminal offences e.g. drug trafficking or trafficking in human beings) in the countries of the Schengen Area and Europol to access the VIS.\nThe national designated authorities must follow a procedure to access the VIS once all conditions for access are fulfilled.\nThe decision also lays down rules to protect the personal data of visa holders.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nVIS connects consulates in non-EU countries and all external border crossing points of Schengen States. It processes data and decisions relating to applications for short-stay visas to visit, or to transit through, the Schengen Area. The VIS prevents fraudulent visa document abuses by assisting border guards when verifying that the bearer of a visa is its rightful holder.\nAccess to the VIS data applies on a case-by-case basis with reasoned written or electronic requests.\nThe designated authorities may only consult the VIS if it is necessary or if there are reasonable grounds for believing that such a search would substantially help in preventing, detecting or investigating serious crime. This may happen, for example, in cases of terrorism or with persons linked directly or indirectly to terrorist or other serious criminal offences.\nEuropol may only access VIS within the limits of its mandate and when it is necessary for the performance of its tasks.\nType of searches in the VIS\nSearches in the VIS are limited to specific data, for example:\n—\n              surname, first names, sex and date, place and country of birth;\n            \n—\n              current nationality and nationality at birth of the visa applicant;\n            \n—\n              type and number of the travel document;\n            \n—\n              purpose of travel, and intended date of arrival and departure;\n            \n—\n              intended border of first entry or transit route;\n            \n—\n              fingerprints;\n            \n—\n              type of visa and number of the visa sticker;\n            \n—\n              details of the person who has issued an invitation for the visa applicant, etc.\n            \nIf the search using any of the above data is successful, the authorities may in addition access other data, such as photographs.\nProtection of personal data and data security\nWhen processing personal data in line with this decision, each EU country has to ensure an adequate level of data protection.\nOnly in urgent cases and for the purpose of preventing and detecting serious offences, personal data may be transferred to non-EU countries or to international organisations. However, in such cases, the consent of the EU countries that entered the data must be obtained.\nEU countries must also ensure the security of the data accessed in VIS during their transmission to the designated authorities.\nWHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?\n              \nCouncil Decision (EU) 2015/1956 set 1 September 2013 as the date on which Decision 2008/633/JHA was to take effect.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe VIS was established by Council Decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004. On 7 March 2005, the Council adopted conclusions stating that EU countries authorities should be guaranteed access to the VIS in order to fight against terrorism and other criminal offences.\n—\nVisa Information System.\nACT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, pp. 129–136)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, pp. 60–81)\nSuccessive amendments and corrections to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 have been incorporated into the original text.
