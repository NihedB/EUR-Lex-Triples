In order to achieve greater consistency, the procedural requirements should be proportionate to the nature and impact of the implementing acts to be adopted.\n(11)\nThe examination procedure should in particular apply for the adoption of acts of general scope designed to implement basic acts and specific implementing acts with a potentially important impact. That procedure should ensure that implementing acts cannot be adopted by the Commission if they are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, except in very exceptional circumstances, where they may apply for a limited period of time. The procedure should also ensure that the Commission is able to review the draft implementing acts where no opinion is delivered by the committee, taking into account the views expressed within the committee.\n(12)\nProvided that the basic act confers implementing powers on the Commission relating to programmes with substantial budgetary implications or directed to third countries, the examination procedure should apply.\n(13)\nThe chair of a committee should endeavour to find solutions which command the widest possible support within the committee or the appeal committee and should explain the manner in which the discussions and suggestions for amendments have been taken into account. For that purpose, the Commission should pay particular attention to the views expressed within the committee or the appeal committee as regards draft definitive anti-dumping or countervailing measures.\n(14)\nWhen considering the adoption of other draft implementing acts concerning particularly sensitive sectors, notably taxation, consumer health, food safety and protection of the environment, the Commission, in order to find a balanced solution, will, as far as possible, act in such a way as to avoid going against any predominant position which might emerge within the appeal committee against the appropriateness of an implementing act.\n(15)\nThe advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all other cases or where it is considered more appropriate.\n(16)\nIt should be possible, where this is provided for in a basic act, to adopt implementing acts which are to apply immediately on imperative grounds of urgency.\n(17)\nThe European Parliament and the Council should be promptly informed of committee proceedings on a regular basis.\n(18)\nEither the European Parliament or the Council should be able at any time to indicate to the Commission that, in its view, a draft implementing act exceeds the implementing powers provided for in the basic act, taking into account their rights relating to the review of the legality of Union acts.\n(19)\nPublic access to information on committee proceedings should be ensured in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (3).\n(20)\nA register containing information on committee proceedings should be kept by the Commission. Consequently, rules relating to the protection of classified documents applicable to the Commission should also apply to the use of the register.\n(21)\nDecision 1999/468/EC should be repealed. In order to ensure the transition between the regime provided for in Decision 1999/468/EC and this Regulation, any reference in existing legislation to the procedures provided for in that Decision should, with the exception of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a thereof, be understood as a reference to the corresponding procedures provided for in this Regulation. The effects of Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC should be provisionally maintained for the purposes of existing basic acts which refer to that Article.\n(22)\nThe Commission’s powers, as laid down by the TFEU, concerning the implementation of the competition rules are not affected by this Regulation,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject-matter\nThis Regulation lays down the rules and general principles governing the mechanisms which apply where a legally binding Union act (hereinafter a ‘basic act’) identifies the need for uniform conditions of implementation and requires that the adoption of implementing acts by the Commission be subject to the control of Member States.\nArticle 2\nSelection of procedures\n1.   A basic act may provide for the application of the advisory procedure or the examination procedure, taking into account the nature or the impact of the implementing act required.\n2.   The examination procedure applies, in particular, for the adoption of:\n(a)\nimplementing acts of general scope;\n(b)\nother implementing acts relating to:\n(i)\nprogrammes with substantial implications;\n(ii)\nthe common agricultural and common fisheries policies;\n(iii)\nthe environment, security and safety, or protection of the health or safety, of humans, animals or plants;\n(iv)\nthe common commercial policy;\n(v)\ntaxation.\n3.   The advisory procedure applies, as a general rule, for the adoption of implementing acts not falling within the ambit of paragraph 2. However, the advisory procedure may apply for the adoption of the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2 in duly justified cases.\nArticle 3\nCommon provisions\n1.   The common provisions set out in this Article shall apply to all the procedures referred to in Articles 4 to 8.\n2.   The Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of representatives of the Member States. The committee shall be chaired by a representative of the Commission. The chair shall not take part in the committee vote.\n3.   The chair shall submit to the committee the draft implementing act to be adopted by the Commission.\nExcept in duly justified cases, the chair shall convene a meeting not less than 14 days from submission of the draft implementing act and of the draft agenda to the committee. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft implementing act within a time limit which the chair may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. Time limits shall be proportionate and shall afford committee members early and effective opportunities to examine the draft implementing act and express their views.\n4.   Until the committee delivers an opinion, any committee member may suggest amendments and the chair may present amended versions of the draft implementing act.\nThe chair shall endeavour to find solutions which command the widest possible support within the committee. The chair shall inform the committee of the manner in which the discussions and suggestions for amendments have been taken into account, in particular as regards those suggestions which have been largely supported within the committee.\n5.   In duly justified cases, the chair may obtain the committee’s opinion by written procedure. The chair shall send the committee members the draft implementing act and shall lay down a time limit for delivery of an opinion according to the urgency of the matter. Any committee member who does not oppose the draft implementing act or who does not explicitly abstain from voting thereon before the expiry of that time limit shall be regarded as having tacitly agreed to the draft implementing act.\nUnless otherwise provided in the basic act, the written procedure shall be terminated without result where, within the time limit referred to in the first subparagraph, the chair so decides or a committee member so requests. In such a case, the chair shall convene a committee meeting within a reasonable time.\n6.   The committee’s opinion shall be recorded in the minutes. Committee members shall have the right to ask for their position to be recorded in the minutes. The chair shall send the minutes to the committee members without delay.\n7.   Where applicable, the control mechanism shall include referral to an appeal committee.\nThe appeal committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure by a simple majority of its component members, on a proposal from the Commission.\nWhere the appeal committee is seised, it shall meet at the earliest 14 days, except in duly justified cases, and at the latest 6 weeks, after the date of referral. Without prejudice to paragraph 3, the appeal committee shall deliver its opinion within 2 months of the date of referral.\nA representative of the Commission shall chair the appeal committee.\nThe chair shall set the date of the appeal committee meeting in close cooperation with the members of the committee, in order to enable Member States and the Commission to ensure an appropriate level of representation. By 1 April 2011, the Commission shall convene the first meeting of the appeal committee in order to adopt its rules of procedure.\nArticle 4\nAdvisory procedure\n1.   Where the advisory procedure applies, the committee shall deliver its opinion, if necessary by taking a vote. If the committee takes a vote, the opinion shall be delivered by a simple majority of its component members.\n2.   The Commission shall decide on the draft implementing act to be adopted, taking the utmost account of the conclusions drawn from the discussions within the committee and of the opinion delivered.\nArticle 5\nExamination procedure\n1.   Where the examination procedure applies, the committee shall deliver its opinion by the majority laid down in Article 16(4) and (5) of the Treaty on European Union and, where applicable, Article 238(3) TFEU, for acts to be adopted on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in those Articles.\n2.   Where the committee delivers a positive opinion, the Commission shall adopt the draft implementing act.\n3.   Without prejudice to Article 7, if the committee delivers a negative opinion, the Commission shall not adopt the draft implementing act. Where an implementing act is deemed to be necessary, the chair may either submit an amended version of the draft implementing act to the same committee within 2 months of delivery of the negative opinion, or submit the draft implementing act within 1 month of such delivery to the appeal committee for further deliberation.\n4.   Where no opinion is delivered, the Commission may adopt the draft implementing act, except in the cases provided for in the second subparagraph. Where the Commission does not adopt the draft implementing act, the chair may submit to the committee an amended version thereof.\nWithout prejudice to Article 7, the Commission shall not adopt the draft implementing act where:\n(a)\nthat act concerns taxation, financial services, the protection of the health or safety of humans, animals or plants, or definitive multilateral safeguard measures;\n(b)\nthe basic act provides that the draft implementing act may not be adopted where no opinion is delivered; or\n(c)\na simple majority of the component members of the committee opposes it.\nIn any of the cases referred to in the second subparagraph, where an implementing act is deemed to be necessary, the chair may either submit an amended version of that act to the same committee within 2 months of the vote, or submit the draft implementing act within 1 month of the vote to the appeal committee for further deliberation.\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4, the following procedure shall apply for the adoption of draft definitive anti-dumping or countervailing measures, where no opinion is delivered by the committee and a simple majority of its component members opposes the draft implementing act.\nThe Commission shall conduct consultations with the Member States. 14 days at the earliest and 1 month at the latest after the committee meeting, the Commission shall inform the committee members of the results of those consultations and submit a draft implementing act to the appeal committee. By way of derogation from Article 3(7), the appeal committee shall meet 14 days at the earliest and 1 month at the latest after the submission of the draft implementing act. The appeal committee shall deliver its opinion in accordance with Article 6. The time limits laid down in this paragraph shall be without prejudice to the need to respect the deadlines laid down in the relevant basic acts.\nArticle 6\nReferral to the appeal committee\n1.   The appeal committee shall deliver its opinion by the majority provided for in Article 5(1).\n2.   Until an opinion is delivered, any member of the appeal committee may suggest amendments to the draft implementing act and the chair may decide whether or not to modify it.\nThe chair shall endeavour to find solutions which command the widest possible support within the appeal committee.\nThe chair shall inform the appeal committee of the manner in which the discussions and suggestions for amendments have been taken into account, in particular as regards suggestions for amendments which have been largely supported within the appeal committee.\n3.   Where the appeal committee delivers a positive opinion, the Commission shall adopt the draft implementing act.\nWhere no opinion is delivered, the Commission may adopt the draft implementing act.\nWhere the appeal committee delivers a negative opinion, the Commission shall not adopt the draft implementing act.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, for the adoption of definitive multilateral safeguard measures, in the absence of a positive opinion voted by the majority provided for in Article 5(1), the Commission shall not adopt the draft measures.\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, until 1 September 2012, the appeal committee shall deliver its opinion on draft definitive anti-dumping or countervailing measures by a simple majority of its component members.\nArticle 7\nAdoption of implementing acts in exceptional cases\nBy way of derogation from Article 5(3) and the second subparagraph of Article 5(4), the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act where it needs to be adopted without delay in order to avoid creating a significant disruption of the markets in the area of agriculture or a risk for the financial interests of the Union within the meaning of Article 325 TFEU.\nIn such a case, the Commission shall immediately submit the adopted implementing act to the appeal committee. Where the appeal committee delivers a negative opinion on the adopted implementing act, the Commission shall repeal that act immediately. Where the appeal committee delivers a positive opinion or no opinion is delivered, the implementing act shall remain in force.\nArticle 8\nImmediately applicable implementing acts\n1.   By way of derogation from Articles 4 and 5, a basic act may provide that, on duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, this Article is to apply.\n2.   The Commission shall adopt an implementing act which shall apply immediately, without its prior submission to a committee, and shall remain in force for a period not exceeding 6 months unless the basic act provides otherwise.\n3.   At the latest 14 days after its adoption, the chair shall submit the act referred to in paragraph 2 to the relevant committee in order to obtain its opinion.\n4.

Where the Commission adopts provisional anti-dumping or countervailing measures, the procedure provided for in this Article shall apply. The Commission shall adopt such measures after consulting or, in cases of extreme urgency, after informing the Member States. In the latter case, consultations shall take place 10 days at the latest after notification to the Member States of the measures adopted by the Commission.\nArticle 9\nRules of procedure\n1.   Each committee shall adopt by a simple majority of its component members its own rules of procedure on the proposal of its chair, on the basis of standard rules to be drawn up by the Commission following consultation with Member States. Such standard rules shall be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIn so far as may be necessary, existing committees shall adapt their rules of procedure to the standard rules.\n2.   The principles and conditions on public access to documents and the rules on data protection applicable to the Commission shall apply to the committees.\nArticle 10\nInformation on committee proceedings\n1.   The Commission shall keep a register of committee proceedings which shall contain:\n(a)\na list of committees;\n(b)\nthe agendas of committee meetings;\n(c)\nthe summary records, together with the lists of the authorities and organisations to which the persons designated by the Member States to represent them belong;\n(d)\nthe draft implementing acts on which the committees are asked to deliver an opinion;\n(e)\nthe voting results;\n(f)\nthe final draft implementing acts following delivery of the opinion of the committees;\n(g)\ninformation concerning the adoption of the final draft implementing acts by the Commission; and\n(h)\nstatistical data on the work of the committees.\n2.

BUZEK\nFor the Council\nThe President\nMARTONYI J.\n(1)  Position of the European Parliament of 16 December 2010 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of 14 February 2011.\n(2)  OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.\n(3)  OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 43.\nSTATEMENT BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION\nArticle 5(2) of this Regulation requires the Commission to adopt a draft implementing act where the committee delivers a positive opinion. This provision does not preclude that Commission may, as is the current practice, in very exceptional cases, take into consideration new circumstances that have arisen after the vote and decide not to adopt a draft implementing act, after having duly informed the committee and the legislator.\nSTATEMENTS BY THE COMMISSION\nThe Commission will proceed to an examination of all legislative acts in force which were not adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in order to assess if those instruments need to be adapted to the regime of delegated acts introduced by Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Commission will make the appropriate proposals as soon as possible and no later than at the dates mentioned in the indicative calendar annexed to this declaration.\nWhile this alignment exercise is underway, the Commission will keep the European Parliament regularly informed on draft implementing measures related to these instruments which should become, in the future, delegated acts.\nAs regards legislative acts in force which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the Commission will review the provisions attached to this procedure in each instrument it intends to modify, in order to adapt them in due course according to the criteria laid down in the Treaty. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council will be entitled to signal basic acts they consider important to adapt as a matter of priority.\nThe Commission will assess the results of this process by the end of 2012 in order to estimate how many legislative acts containing references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny remain in force. The Commission will then prepare the appropriate legislative initiatives to complete the adaptation. The overall objective of the Commission is that, by the end of the 7th term of the Parliament, all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny would have been removed from all legislative instruments.\nThe Commission notes that it has recently launched a study which will provide a complete and objective review of all aspects of the EU's trade defence policy and practice, including an evaluation of the performance, methods, utilisation and effectiveness of the present TDI scheme in achieving its trade policy objectives, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the existing and potential policy decisions of the European Union (e.g., the Union interest test, the lesser duty rule, the duty collection system) in comparison with the policy decisions made by certain trading partners and an examination of the basic anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations in light of the administrative practice of the EU institutions, the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\nThe Commission intends, in the light of the results of the study and of developments in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations to explore whether and how to further update and modernize the EU's trade defence instruments\nThe Commission also recalls the recent initiatives it has taken to improve the transparency of the operation of trade defence instruments (such as the appointment of a Hearing Officer) and its work with Member States to clarify key elements of trade defence practice. The Commission attaches substantial importance to this work, and will seek to identify, in consultation with the Member States, other initiatives which could be taken in this respect.\nUnder the comitology rules based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC, where a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) management committee has delivered an unfavourable opinion, the Commission must submit the draft measure in question to the Council which may take a different decision within a month. However, the Commission is not barred from acting but has the choice to either put the measure in place or defer its application. Hence, the Commission may take the measure where it considers on balance that suspending its application would for instance provoke irreversible negative market effects. When afterwards the Council decides otherwise the measure put in effect by the Commission becomes of course redundant. Thus the current rules equip the Commission with an instrument that allows protecting the common interest of the whole Union by adopting a measure at least on an interim basis.\nArticle 7 of this Regulation pursues the objective of maintaining this approach within the new comitology arrangements but limited to exceptional situations and on the basis of clearly defined and restrictive criteria. It would allow the Commission to adopt a draft measure despite the unfavourable opinion of the examination committee provided that its ‘non adoption within an imperative deadline would create a significant disruption of the markets (…) or for the financial interests of the Union.’ The provision refers to situations where it is not possible to wait until the committee votes again on the same or another draft measure because in the meantime the market would be significantly disrupted e.g. due to the speculative behaviour of operators. To ensure the Union's ability to act it would give Member States and the Commission the opportunity to have another informed discussion on the draft measure without leaving things undecided and open to speculation with the negative consequences for the markets and the budget.\nSuch situations may namely arise in the context of the day-to-day management of the CAP (e.g. fixing of export refunds, management of licences, special safeguard clause) where decisions need often to be taken quickly and can have significant economic consequences for the markets and thus farmers and operators but also for the budget of the Union.\nIn cases where the European Parliament or the Council indicate to the Commission that they consider a draft implementing act to exceed the implementing powers provided for in the basic act, the Commission will immediately review the draft implementing act taking into account the positions expressed by the European Parliament or the Council.\nThe Commission will act in a manner which takes duly into account the urgency of the matter.\nBefore deciding whether the draft implementing act shall be adopted, amended or withdrawn, the Commission will inform the European Parliament or the Council of the action it intends to take and of its reasons for doing so.", "summary": "Committees’ role in European Commission’s implementing powers\nCommittees’ role in European Commission’s implementing powers\nBefore adopting implementing acts, the European Commission has to consult a committee comprising representatives of each of the EU countries on the draft that it is proposing.\nACT\n                  \nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?\n                     \nThe regulation lays down the rules for the control by EU countries of the exercise by the Commission of its implementing powers (Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). This control is by means of what are known in EU jargon as ‘comitology’ procedures, i.e. the Commission must submit each draft implementing act to committees consisting of EU countries' representatives and chaired by the Commission.\nAccording to the Commission’s latest report on developments in regard to the comitology system, there are about 300 committees that cover virtually all of the EU’s competences (in particular agriculture, environment, transport, health and consumers, etc.). In 2013, the Commission adopted more than 1 700 implementing acts.\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nThe regulation lays down two procedures for controlling the Commission's exercise of its implementing powers (granted by the legislator).\nThe examination procedure: this is mainly used for: (i) measures of general scope and (ii) measures in certain policy fields (for example agriculture, fisheries, environment, health, trade and taxation).\nCommission implementing acts must receive the support of a qualified majority (a weighted system of voting where 16 of the 28 EU countries (1) must vote in favour and these votes must represent at least 65 % of the EU's population) of the committee. If the committee gives an unfavourable opinion, the Commission may submit the draft act to an appeal committee to see whether the examination of the measure should continue or amend the text. If the outcome of the committee discussions is a ‘no opinion’, the Commission may adopt the draft act under certain conditions.\nThe advisory procedure: this is generally used for all other implementing measures (for example individual measures in the field of culture). The Commission must take the utmost account of the opinion of the Committee, which is adopted by a simple majority (a majority of those voting).\nRight of scrutiny of the European Parliament and the Council: when the basic legislative act has been adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure (the most common decision-making procedure, covering the majority of policy areas, and in which the European Parliament and the Council have equal weight), the European Parliament or the Council may at any time inform the Commission that it considers the proposed implementing act to exceed the powers conferred on the Commission. In such cases, the Commission must review the draft act and decide to maintain, amend or withdraw it.\nFROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?\n                     \nFrom 1 March 2011.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nArticle 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union allows the Commission to adopt implementing measures for a legal act when uniform conditions of implementation are necessary. The basic legal act must explicitly confer on the Commission the power to adopt implementing acts.\nSee also the European Commission’s comitology website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011\n1.3.2011\n-\nOJ L 55, 28.2.2011, pp. 13-20\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nReport from the Commission on the working of committees during 2013 (COM(2014) 572 final of 16.9.2014).\nlast update 20.01.2015(1) The United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union and becomes a third country (non-EU country) as of 1 February 2020.", "tags": ["power of implementation", "European Commission", "EU control", "EU Member State", "legal basis", "powers of the institutions (EU)"], "subjects": ["Provisions governing the Institutions"], "split": "validation", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
