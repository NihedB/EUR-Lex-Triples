Antibiotic resistance increases morbidity and mortality due to communicable diseases, which leads to a diminution in the quality of life and also to additional health and medical care costs.\nAntibiotics are indispensable in combatting infectious diseases and it is therefore imperative to preserve the effectiveness of those medicinal products which are still effective.\nAntibiotic resistance and its various causes need a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach. National initiatives are not enough to reduce the risks and to effectively prevent micro-organisms from becoming resistant to antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine and in animal feedingstuffs, nor can they preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diseases. A common strategy and coordinated action are required at Community and international levels.\nBearing in mind the global dimension of this problem, the Member States and the Commission must actively promote the aims of this resolution in international organisations, in particular in the World Health Organisation (WHO), the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the International Office of Epizootics (OIE).\nAccording to the Council, the overall strategy should be based on risk assessment using established scientific findings and comprise coordinated control and preventive action (for example in relation to surveillance of antibiotic resistance in humans, animals and foodstuffs and its effects, infection control in health care and infection control in animal production, development of new therapeutic and preventive medicaments, etc) and research work (notably on the effects of preventive measures, the development of new antibiotics and alternatives, the best use of antibiotics, determinants which increase the risk of emergence of antibiotic resistance, mechanisms of the spread and development of antibiotic resistance, or best farming practice so as to improve animal health).\nIn the context of this strategy, Member States are called upon:\nto establish multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral policies in order to facilitate the containment of the spread of antibiotic resistance;\nto cooperate in order to enable an effective comparable monitoring of the supply and use of antibiotics and an effective comparable surveillance of antibiotic resistance;\nto maintain the principle of antibiotics authorised as human and veterinary medicine being \"prescription-only-medicines\" and to ensure vigilance on the implementation of this principle;\nto promote adherence to the principles of infection control both in hospitals and non-hospital care as well as in animal production;\nto promote optimal prescribing and use of antibiotics (through professional education, guidelines, etc.) and to prevent their unnecessary and inappropriate use in human and veterinary medicine;\nto promote actions aimed at raising the awareness of health professionals, farmers and the general public of the problem of antibiotic resistance;\nto promote health orientated animal production systems, thus reducing the need for antibiotics;\nto promote research in this area;\nto cooperate closely with the Commission, in particular in the aforementioned areas.\nThe Commission is invited:\nto include as a priority the surveillance of antibiotic resistance in human medicine and in the field of zoonosis control and to promote - through the Community network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases - the complementarity of this surveillance;\nto ensure, on the basis of comparable data provided by Member States, the reporting, including conclusions, on the supply and use of antibiotics in particular in human and veterinary medicine as well as in animal feeding, horticulture and other agricultural productions and foodstuffs;\nto support the exchange of experience and information concerning the rational usage of antibiotics by appropriate Community activities;\nto promote research work in the implementation of the Fifth Research Framework Programme with regard to the evolution of antibiotic resistance within bacterial populations and the understanding of the transmissibility of resistant bacteria in humans, animal populations and the environment;\nto consider the advisability of preparing a proposal for a Recommendation in accordance with the Treaty;\nto examine the necessity of reviewing current Community legislation in the areas of human and veterinary medicine;\nto pay particular attention to the problem of antibiotic resistance in specific health actions related to applicant countries, in particular in the framework of the Phare 2000 programme.\nThe Commission should promote cooperation in close coordination with the Member States and the competent international organisations.\nLast updated: 04.05.2006", "tags": ["pharmaceutical legislation", "medicine", "veterinary medicine", "antibiotic", "public health", "biology"], "subjects": ["Public health"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"31999Y0713(01)_p1": {"text": "COUNCIL RESOLUTIONof 8 June 1999on antibiotic resistance\"A strategy against the microbial threat\"(1999/C 195/01)THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,1.
