{"celex_id": "32013L0034", "reference": "29.6.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 182/19\nDIRECTIVE 2013/34/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 June 2013\non the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 50(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThis Directive takes into account the Commission's better regulation programme, and, in particular, the Commission Communication entitled \"Smart Regulation in the European Union\", which aims at designing and delivering regulation of the highest quality whilst respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and ensuring that the administrative burdens are proportionate to the benefits they bring. The Commission Communication entitled \"Think Small First – Small Business Act for Europe\", adopted in June 2008 and revised in February 2011, recognises the central role played by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Union economy and aims to improve the overall approach to entrepreneurship and to anchor the \"think small first\" principle in policy-making from regulation to public service. The European Council of 24 and 25 March 2011 welcomed the Commission's intention to present the \"Single Market Act\" with measures creating growth and jobs, bringing tangible results to citizens and businesses.\nThe Commission Communication entitled \"Single Market Act\", adopted in April 2011, proposes to simplify the Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (3) and the Seventh Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 based on the Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty on consolidated accounts (4) (the Accounting Directives) as regards financial information obligations and to reduce administrative burdens, in particular for SMEs. \"The Europe 2020 Strategy\" for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth aims to reduce administrative burdens and improve the business environment, in particular for SMEs, and to promote the internationalisation of SMEs. The European Council of 24 and 25 March 2011 also called for the overall regulatory burden, in particular for SMEs, to be reduced at both Union and national level and suggested measures to increase productivity, such as the removal of red tape and the improvement of the regulatory framework for SMEs.\n(2)\nOn 18 December 2008 the European Parliament adopted a non-legislative resolution on accounting requirements as regards small and medium-sized companies, particularly micro-entities (5), stating that the Accounting Directives are often very burdensome for small and medium-sized companies, and in particular for micro-entities, and asking the Commission to continue its efforts to review those Directives.\n(3)\nThe coordination of national provisions concerning the presentation and content of annual financial statements and management reports, the measurement bases used therein and their publication in respect of certain types of undertakings with limited liability is of special importance for the protection of shareholders, members and third parties. Simultaneous coordination is necessary in those fields for such types of undertakings because, on the one hand, some undertakings operate in more than one Member State and, on the other hand, such undertakings offer no safeguards to third parties beyond the amounts of their net assets.\n(4)\nAnnual financial statements pursue various objectives and do not merely provide information for investors in capital markets but also give an account of past transactions and enhance corporate governance. Union accounting legislation needs to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of the addressees of financial statements and the interest of undertakings in not being unduly burdened with reporting requirements.\n(5)\nThe scope of this Directive should include certain undertakings with limited liability such as public and private limited liability companies. Additionally, there is a substantial number of partnerships and limited partnerships all the fully liable members of which are constituted either as public or as private limited liability companies, and such partnerships should therefore be subject to the coordination measures of this Directive. This Directive should also ensure that partnerships fall within its scope where members of a partnership which are not constituted as private or public limited companies in fact have limited liability for the partnership's obligations because that liability is limited by other undertakings within the scope of this Directive. The exclusion of not-for-profit undertakings from the scope of this Directive is consistent with its purpose, in line with point (g) of Article 50(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(6)\nThe scope of this Directive should be principles-based and should ensure that it is not possible for an undertaking to exclude itself from that scope by creating a group structure containing multiple layers of undertakings established inside or outside the Union.\n(7)\nThe provisions of this Directive should apply only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with, or contradicted by, provisions on the financial reporting of certain types of undertakings or provisions regarding the distribution of an undertaking's capital which are laid down in other legislative acts in force adopted by one or more Union institutions.\n(8)\nIt is necessary, moreover, to establish minimum equivalent legal requirements at Union level as regards the extent of the financial information that should be made available to the public by undertakings that are in competition with one another.\n(9)\nAnnual financial statements should be prepared on a prudent basis and should give a true and fair view of an undertaking's assets and liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. It is possible that, in exceptional cases, a financial statement does not give such a true and fair view where provisions of this Directive are applied. In such cases, the undertaking should depart from such provisions in order to give a true and fair view. The Member States should be allowed to define such exceptional cases and to lay down the relevant special rules which are to apply in those cases. Those exceptional cases should be understood to be only very unusual transactions and unusual situations and should, for instance, not be related to entire specific sectors.\n(10)\nThis Directive should ensure that the requirements for small undertakings are to a large extent harmonised throughout the Union. This Directive is based on the \"think small first\" principle. In order to avoid disproportionate administrative burdens on those undertakings, Member States should only be allowed to require a few disclosures by way of notes that are additional to the mandatory notes. In the case of a single filing system, however, Member States may in certain cases require a limited number of additional disclosures where these are explicitly required by their national tax legislation and are strictly necessary for the purposes of tax collection. It should be possible for Member States to impose requirements on medium-sized and large undertakings that go further than the minimum requirements prescribed by this Directive.\n(11)\nWhere this Directive allows Member States to impose additional requirements on, for instance, small undertakings, this means that Member States can make use of this option in full or in part by requiring less than the option allows for. In the same way, where this Directive allows Member States to make use of an exemption in relation to, for instance, small undertakings, this means that Member States can exempt such undertakings wholly or in part.\n(12)\nSmall, medium-sized and large undertakings should be defined and distinguished by reference to balance sheet total, net turnover and the average number of employees during the financial year, as those criteria typically provide objective evidence as to the size of an undertaking. However, where a parent undertaking is not preparing consolidated financial statements for the group, Member States should be allowed to take steps they deem necessary to require that such an undertaking be classified as a larger undertaking by determining its size and resulting category on a consolidated or aggregated basis. Where a Member State applies one or more of the optional exemptions for micro-undertakings, micro-undertakings should also be defined by reference to balance sheet total, net turnover and the average number of employees during the financial year. Member States should not be obliged to define separate categories for medium-sized and large undertakings in their national legislation if medium-sized undertakings are subject to the same requirements as large undertakings.\n(13)\nMicro-undertakings have limited resources with which to comply with demanding regulatory requirements. Where no specific rules are in place for micro-undertakings, the rules applying to small undertakings apply to them. Those rules place on them administrative burdens which are disproportionate to their size and are, therefore, relatively more onerous for micro-undertakings as compared to other small undertakings. Therefore, it should be possible for Member States to exempt micro-undertakings from certain obligations applying to small undertakings that would impose excessive administrative burdens on them. However, micro-undertakings should still be subject to any national obligation to keep records showing their business transactions and financial position. Moreover, investment undertakings and financial holding undertakings should be excluded from the benefits of simplifications applicable to micro-undertakings.\n(14)\nMember States should take into account the specific conditions and needs of their own markets when making a decision about whether or how to implement a distinct regime for micro-undertakings within the context of this Directive.\n(15)\nPublication of financial statements can be burdensome for micro-undertakings. At the same time, Member States need to ensure compliance with this Directive. Accordingly, Member States making use of the exemptions for micro-undertakings provided for in this Directive should be allowed to exempt micro-undertakings from a general publication requirement, provided that balance sheet information is duly filed, in accordance with national law, with at least one designated competent authority and that the information is forwarded to the business register, so that a copy should be obtainable upon application. In such cases, the obligation laid down in this Directive to publish any accounting document in accordance with Article 3(5) of Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent (6), should not apply.\n(16)\nTo ensure the disclosure of comparable and equivalent information, recognition and measurement principles should include the going concern, the prudence, and the accrual bases. Set-offs between asset and liability items and income and expense items should not be allowed and components of assets and liabilities should be valued separately. In specific cases, however, Member States should be allowed to permit or require undertakings to perform set-offs between asset and liability items and income and expense items. The presentation of items in financial statements should have regard to the economic reality or commercial substance of the underlying transaction or arrangement. Member States should, however, be allowed to exempt undertakings from applying that principle.\n(17)\nThe principle of materiality should govern recognition, measurement, presentation, disclosure and consolidation in financial statements. According to the principle of materiality, information that is considered immaterial may, for instance, be aggregated in the financial statements. However, while a single item might be considered to be immaterial, immaterial items of a similar nature might be considered material when taken as a whole. Member States should be allowed to limit the mandatory application of the principle of materiality to presentation and disclosure. The principle of materiality should not affect any national obligation to keep complete records showing business transactions and financial position.\n(18)\nItems recognised in annual financial statements should be measured on the basis of the principle of purchase price or production cost to ensure the reliability of information contained in financial statements. However, Member States should be allowed to permit or require undertakings to revalue fixed assets in order that more relevant information may be provided to the users of financial statements.\n(19)\nThe need for comparability of financial information throughout the Union makes it necessary to require Member States to allow a system of fair value accounting for certain financial instruments. Furthermore, systems of fair value accounting provide information that can be of more relevance to the users of financial statements than purchase price or production cost-based information. Accordingly, Member States should permit the adoption of a fair value system of accounting by all undertakings or classes of undertaking, other than micro-undertakings making use of the exemptions provided for in this Directive, in respect of both annual and consolidated financial statements or, if a Member State so chooses, in respect of consolidated financial statements only. Furthermore, Member States should be allowed to permit or require fair value accounting for assets other than financial instruments.\n(20)\nA limited number of layouts for the balance sheet is necessary to allow users of financial statements to better compare the financial position of undertakings within the Union. Member States should require the use of one layout for the balance sheet and should be allowed to offer a choice from amongst permitted layouts. However, Member States should be able to permit or require undertakings to modify the layout and present a balance sheet distinguishing between current and non-current items. A profit and loss account layout showing the nature of expenses and a profit and loss account layout showing the function of expenses should be permitted. Member States should require the use of one layout for the profit and loss account and should be allowed to offer a choice from amongst permitted layouts. Member States should also be able to allow undertakings to present a statement of performance instead of a profit and loss account prepared in accordance with one of the permitted layouts. Simplifications of the required layouts may be made available for small and medium-sized undertakings. However, Member States should be allowed to restrict layouts of the balance sheet and profit and loss account if necessary for the electronic filing of financial statements.\n(21)\nFor comparability reasons, a common framework for recognition, measurement and presentation of, inter alia, value adjustments, goodwill, provisions, stocks of goods and fungible assets, and income and expenditure of exceptional size or incidence should be provided.\n(22)\nThe recognition and measurement of some items in financial statements are based on estimates, judgements and models rather than exact depictions. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, certain items in financial statements cannot be measured precisely but can only be estimated. Estimation involves judgements based on the latest available reliable information. The use of estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial statements. This is especially true in the case of provisions, which by their nature are more uncertain than most other items in the balance sheet. Estimates should be based on a prudent judgement of the management of the undertaking and calculated on an objective basis, supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases, even reports from independent experts. The evidence considered should include any additional evidence provided by events after the balance-sheet date.\n(23)\nThe information presented in the balance sheet and in the profit and loss account should be supplemented by disclosures by way of notes to the financial statements. Users of financial statements typically have a limited need for supplementary information from small undertakings, and it can be costly for small undertakings to collate that supplementary information. A limited disclosure regime for small undertakings is, therefore, justified. However, where a micro- or small undertaking considers that it is beneficial to provide additional disclosures of the types required of medium-sized and large undertakings, or other disclosures not provided for in this Directive, it should not be prevented from doing so.\n(24)\nDisclosure in respect of accounting policies is one of the key elements of the notes to the financial statements. Such disclosure should include, in particular, the measurement bases applied to various items, a statement on the conformity of those accounting policies with the going concern concept and any significant changes to the accounting policies adopted.\n(25)\nUsers of financial statements prepared by medium-sized and large undertakings typically have more sophisticated needs. Therefore, further disclosures should be provided in certain areas. Exemption from certain disclosure obligations is justified where such disclosure would be prejudicial to certain persons or to the undertaking.\n(26)\nThe management report and the consolidated management report are important elements of financial reporting. A fair review of the development of the business and of its position should be provided, in a manner consistent with the size and complexity of the business. The information should not be restricted to the financial aspects of the undertaking's business, and there should be an analysis of environmental and social aspects of the business necessary for an understanding of the undertaking's development, performance or position. In cases where the consolidated management report and the parent undertaking management report are presented in a single report, it may be appropriate to give greater emphasis to those matters which are significant to the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole. However, having regard to the potential burden placed on small and medium-sized undertakings, it is appropriate to provide that Member States may choose to waive the obligation to provide non-financial information in the management report of such undertakings.\n(27)\nMember States should have the possibility of exempting small undertakings from the obligation to draw up a management report provided that such undertakings include, in the notes to the financial statements, the data concerning the acquisition of own shares referred to in Article 24(2) of Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent (7).\n(28)\nGiven that listed undertakings can have a prominent role in the economies in which they operate, the provisions of this Directive concerning the corporate governance statement should apply to undertakings whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market.\n(29)\nMany undertakings own other undertakings and the aim of coordinating the legislation governing consolidated financial statements is to protect the interests subsisting in companies with share capital. Consolidated financial statements should be drawn up so that financial information concerning such undertakings may be conveyed to members and third parties. National law governing consolidated financial statements should therefore be coordinated in order to achieve the objectives of comparability and equivalence in the information which undertakings should publish within the Union. However, given the lack of an arm's-length transaction price, Member States should be allowed to permit intra-group transfers of participating interests, so-called common control transactions, to be accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting, in which the book value of shares held in an undertaking included in a consolidation is set off against the corresponding percentage of capital only.\n(30)\nIn Directive 83/349/EEC there was a requirement to prepare consolidated financial statements for groups in cases where either the parent undertaking or one or more of the subsidiary undertakings was established as one of the types of undertakings listed in Annex I or Annex II to this Directive. Member States had the option of exempting parent undertakings from the requirement to draw up consolidated accounts in cases where the parent undertaking was not of the type listed in Annex I or Annex II. This Directive requires only parent undertakings of the types listed in Annex I or, in certain circumstances, Annex II to draw up consolidated financial statements, but does not preclude Member States from extending the scope of this Directive to cover other situations as well. In substance there is therefore no change, as it remains up to the Member States to decide whether to require undertakings which do not fall within the scope of this Directive to prepare consolidated financial statements.\n(31)\nConsolidated financial statements should present the activities of a parent undertaking and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity (a group). Undertakings controlled by the parent undertaking should be considered as subsidiary undertakings. Control should be based on holding a majority of voting rights, but control may also exist where there are agreements with fellow shareholders or members. In certain circumstances control may be effectively exercised where the parent holds a minority or none of the shares in the subsidiary. Member States should be entitled to require that undertakings not subject to control, but which are managed on a unified basis or have a common administrative, managerial or supervisory body, be included in consolidated financial statements.\n(32)\nA subsidiary undertaking which is itself a parent undertaking should draw up consolidated financial statements. Nevertheless, Member States should be entitled to exempt such a parent undertaking from the obligation to draw up such consolidated financial statements in certain circumstances, provided that its members and third parties are sufficiently protected.\n(33)\nSmall groups should be exempt from the obligation to prepare consolidated financial statements as the users of small undertakings' financial statements do not have sophisticated information needs and it can be costly to prepare consolidated financial statements in addition to the annual financial statements of the parent and subsidiary undertakings. Member States should be able to exempt medium-sized groups from the obligation to prepare consolidated financial statements on the same cost/benefit grounds unless any of the affiliated undertakings is a public-interest entity.\n(34)\nConsolidation requires the full incorporation of the assets and liabilities and of the income and expenditure of group undertakings, the separate disclosure of non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet within capital and reserves and the separate disclosure of non-controlling interests in the profit and loss of the group in the consolidated profit and loss accounts. However, the necessary corrections should be made to eliminate the effects of the financial relations between the undertakings consolidated.\n(35)\nRecognition and measurement principles applicable to the preparation of annual financial statements should also apply to the preparation of consolidated financial statements. However, Member States should be allowed to permit the general provisions and principles stated in this Directive to be applied differently in annual financial statements than in consolidated financial statements.\n(36)\nAssociated undertakings should be included in consolidated financial statements by means of the equity method. The provisions on measurement of associated undertakings should in substance remain unchanged from Directive 83/349/EEC, and the methods allowed under that Directive can still be applied. Member States should also be able to permit or require that a jointly managed undertaking be proportionately consolidated within consolidated financial statements.\n(37)\nConsolidated financial statements should include all disclosures by way of notes to the financial statements for the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole. The names, registered offices and group interest in the undertakings' capital should also be disclosed in respect of subsidiaries, associated undertakings, jointly managed undertakings and participating interests.\n(38)\nThe annual financial statements of all undertakings to which this Directive applies should be published in accordance with Directive 2009/101/EC. It is, however, appropriate to provide that certain derogations may be granted in this area for small and medium-sized undertakings.\n(39)\nThe Member States are strongly encouraged to develop electronic publication systems that allow undertakings to file accounting data, including statutory financial statements, only once and in a form that allows multiple users to access and use the data easily. With regard to the reporting of financial statements, the Commission is encouraged to explore means for a harmonised electronic format. Such systems should, however, not be burdensome to small and medium-sized undertakings.\n(40)\nThe Members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies of an undertaking should, as a minimum requirement, be collectively responsible to the undertaking for drawing up and publishing annual financial statements and management reports. The same approach should also apply to members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies of undertakings drawing up consolidated financial statements. Those bodies act within the competences assigned to them by national law. This should not prevent Member States from going further and providing for direct responsibility to shareholders or even other stakeholders.\n(41)\nLiability for drawing up and publishing annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, as well as management reports and consolidated management reports, is based on national law. Appropriate liability rules, as laid down by each Member State under its national law, should be applicable to members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies of an undertaking. Member States should be allowed to determine the extent of the liability.\n(42)\nIn order to promote credible financial reporting processes across the Union, members of the body within an undertaking that is responsible for the preparation of the undertaking's financial statements should ensure that the financial information included in the undertaking's annual financial statement and the group's consolidated financial statement gives a true and fair view.\n(43)\nAnnual financial statements and consolidated financial statements should be audited. The requirement that an audit opinion should state whether annual or consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework should not be understood as restricting the scope of that opinion but as clarifying the context in which it is expressed. The annual financial statements of small undertakings should not be covered by this audit obligation, as audit can be a significant administrative burden for that category of undertaking, while for many small undertakings the same persons are both shareholders and managers and, therefore, have limited need for third-party assurance on financial statements. However, this Directive should not prevent Member States from imposing an audit on their small undertakings, taking into account the specific conditions and needs of small undertakings and the users of their financial statements. Furthermore, it is more appropriate to define the content of the audit report in Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (8). Therefore that directive should be amended accordingly.\n(44)\nIn order to provide for enhanced transparency of payments made to governments, large undertakings and public-interest entities which are active in the extractive industry or logging of primary forests (9) should disclose material payments made to governments in the countries in which they operate in a separate report, on an annual basis. Such undertakings are active in countries rich in natural resources, in particular minerals, oil, natural gas and primary forests. The report should include types of payments comparable to those disclosed by an undertaking participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The initiative is also complementary to the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan of the European Union (EU FLEGT) and the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 laying down the obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market (10), which require traders of timber products to exercise due diligence in order to prevent illegal wood from entering the Union market.\n(45)\nThe report should serve to help governments of resource-rich countries to implement the EITI principles and criteria and account to their citizens for payments such governments receive from undertakings active in the extractive industry or loggers of primary forests operating within their jurisdiction. The report should incorporate disclosures on a country and project basis. A project should be defined as the operational activities that are governed by a single contract, license, lease, concession or similar legal agreements and form the basis for payment liabilities to a government. Nonetheless, if multiple such agreements are substantially interconnected, this should be considered a project. ‧Substantially interconnected‧ legal agreements should be understood as a set of operationally and geographically integrated contracts, licenses, leases or concessions or related agreements with substantially similar terms that are signed with a government, giving rise to payment liabilities. Such agreements can be governed by a single contract, joint venture, production sharing agreement, or other overarching legal agreement.\n(46)\nAny payment, whether made as a single payment or as a series of related payments, need not be taken into account in the report if it is below EUR 100 000 within a financial year. This means that, in the case of any arrangement providing for periodic payments or instalments (e.g. rental fees), the undertaking must consider the aggregate amount of the related periodic payments or instalments of the related payments in determining whether the threshold has been met for that series of payments, and accordingly, whether disclosure is required.\n(47)\nUndertakings active in the extractive industry or the logging of primary forests should not be required to disaggregate and allocate payments on a project basis where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed on the undertakings at the entity level rather than the project level. For instance, if an undertaking has more than one project in a host country, and that country's government levies corporate income taxes on the undertaking with respect to the undertaking's income in the country as a whole, and not with respect to a particular project or operation within the country, the undertaking would be permitted to disclose the resulting income tax payment or payments without specifying a particular project associated with the payment.\n(48)\nAn undertaking active in the extractive industry or in the logging of primary forests generally does not need to disclose dividends paid to a government as a common or ordinary shareholder of that undertaking as long as the dividend is paid to the government on the same terms as to other shareholders. However, the undertaking will be required to disclose any dividends paid in lieu of production entitlements or royalties.\n(49)\nIn order to address the potential for circumvention of disclosure requirements, this Directive should specify that payments are to be disclosed with respect to the substance of the activity or payment concerned. Therefore, the undertaking should not be able to avoid disclosure by, for example, re-characterising an activity that would otherwise be covered by this Directive. In addition, payments or activities should not be artificially split or aggregated with a view to evading such disclosure requirements.\n(50)\nIn order to ascertain the circumstances in which undertakings should be exempted from the reporting requirements provided for in Chapter 10, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of determining the criteria to be applied when assessing whether third country reporting requirements are equivalent to the requirements of that Chapter. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(51)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Article 46(1), implementing powers should be conferred upon the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for the control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (11).\n(52)\nThe reporting regime should be subject to a review and a report by the Commission within three years of the expiry of the deadline for transposition of this Directive by the Member States. That review should consider the effectiveness of the regime and take into account international developments, including issues of competitiveness and energy security. The review should also consider the extension of reporting requirements to additional industry sectors and whether the report should be audited. In addition, the review should take into account the experience of preparers and users of the payments information and consider whether it would be appropriate to include additional payment information such as effective tax rates and recipient details such as bank account information.\n(53)\nIn line with the conclusions of the G8 Summit in Deauville in May 2011 and in order to promote a level international playing field, the Commission should continue to encourage all the international partners to introduce similar requirements concerning reporting on payments to governments. Continued work on the relevant international accounting standard is particularly important in this context.\n(54)\nIn order to take account of future changes to the laws of the Member States and to Union legislation concerning company types, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU in order to update the lists of undertakings contained in Annexes I and II. The use of delegated acts is also necessary in order to adapt the undertaking size criteria, as with the passage of time inflation will erode their real value. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(55)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely facilitating cross-border investment and improving Union-wide comparability and public confidence in financial statements and reports through enhanced and consistent specific disclosures, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and the effects of this Directive, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(56)\nThis Directive replaces Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC. Therefore, those Directives should be repealed.\n(57)\nThis Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(58)\nIn accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents of 28 September 2011, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of correlation tables to be justified,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nSCOPE, DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORIES OF UNDERTAKINGS AND GROUPS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.   The coordination measures prescribed by this Directive shall apply to the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the types of undertakings listed:\n(a)\nin Annex I;\n(b)\nin Annex II, where all of the direct or indirect members of the undertaking having otherwise unlimited liability in fact have limited liability by reason of those members being undertakings which are:\n(i)\nof the types listed in Annex I; or\n(ii)\nnot governed by the law of a Member State but which have a legal form comparable to those listed in Annex I.\n2.   Member States shall inform the Commission within a reasonable period of time of changes in the types of undertakings in their national law that may affect the accuracy of Annex I or Annex II. In such a case, the Commission shall be empowered to adapt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 49, the lists of undertakings contained in Annexes I and II.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‧public-interest entities‧ means undertakings within the scope of Article 1 which are:\n(a)\ngoverned by the law of a Member State and whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State within the meaning of point (14) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (12);\n(b)\ncredit institutions as defined in point (1) of Article 4 of Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (13), other than those referred to in Article 2 of that Directive;\n(c)\ninsurance undertakings within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Council Directive 91/674/EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts of insurance undertakings (14); or\n(d)\ndesignated by Member States as public-interest entities, for instance undertakings that are of significant public relevance because of the nature of their business, their size or the number of their employees;\n(2)\n‧participating interest‧ means rights in the capital of other undertakings, whether or not represented by certificates, which, by creating a durable link with those undertakings, are intended to contribute to the activities of the undertaking which holds those rights.

In applying one or more of the options in Article 36, Member States shall define micro-undertakings as undertakings which on their balance sheet dates do not exceed the limits of at least two of the three following criteria:\n(a)\nbalance sheet total: EUR 350 000;\n(b)\nnet turnover: EUR 700 000;\n(c)\naverage number of employees during the financial year: 10.\n2.   Small undertakings shall be undertakings which on their balance sheet dates do not exceed the limits of at least two of the three following criteria:\n(a)\nbalance sheet total: EUR 4 000 000;\n(b)\nnet turnover: EUR 8 000 000;\n(c)\naverage number of employees during the financial year: 50.\nMember States may define thresholds exceeding the thresholds in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. However, the thresholds shall not exceed EUR 6 000 000 for the balance sheet total and EUR 12 000 000 for the net turnover.\n3.   Medium-sized undertakings shall be undertakings which are not micro-undertakings or small undertakings and which on their balance sheet dates do not exceed the limits of at least two of the three following criteria:\n(a)\nbalance sheet total: EUR 20 000 000;\n(b)\nnet turnover: EUR 40 000 000;\n(c)\naverage number of employees during the financial year: 250.\n4.   Large undertakings shall be undertakings which on their balance sheet dates exceed at least two of the three following criteria:\n(a)\nbalance sheet total: EUR 20 000 000;\n(b)\nnet turnover: EUR 40 000 000;\n(c)\naverage number of employees during the financial year: 250.\n5.   Small groups shall be groups consisting of parent and subsidiary undertakings to be included in a consolidation and which, on a consolidated basis, do not exceed the limits of at least two of the three following criteria on the balance sheet date of the parent undertaking:\n(a)\nbalance sheet total: EUR 4 000 000;\n(b)\nnet turnover: EUR 8 000 000;\n(c)\naverage number of employees during the financial year: 50.\nMember States may define thresholds exceeding the thresholds in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. However, the thresholds shall not exceed EUR 6 000 000 for the balance sheet total and EUR 12 000 000 for the net turnover.\n6.   Medium-sized groups shall be groups which are not small groups, which consist of parent and subsidiary undertakings to be included in a consolidation and which, on a consolidated basis, do not exceed the limits of at least two of the three following criteria on the balance sheet date of the parent undertaking:\n(a)\nbalance sheet total: EUR 20 000 000;\n(b)\nnet turnover: EUR 40 000 000;\n(c)\naverage number of employees during the financial year: 250.\n7.   Large groups shall be groups consisting of parent and subsidiary undertakings to be included in a consolidation and which, on a consolidated basis, exceed the limits of at least two of the three following criteria on the balance sheet date of the parent undertaking:\n(a)\nbalance sheet total: EUR 20 000 000;\n(b)\nnet turnover: EUR 40 000 000;\n(c)\naverage number of employees during the financial year: 250.\n8.   Member States shall permit the set-off referred to in Article 24(3) and any elimination as a consequence of Article 24(7) not to be effected when the limits in paragraphs 5 to 7 of this Article are calculated. In such cases, the limits for the balance sheet total and net turnover criteria shall be increased by 20 %.\n9.   In the case of those Member States which have not adopted the euro, the amount in national currency equivalent to the amounts set out in paragraphs 1 to 7 shall be that obtained by applying the exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union as at the date of the entry into force of any Directive setting those amounts.\nFor the purposes of conversion into the national currencies of those Member States which have not adopted the euro, the amounts in euro specified in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 may be increased or decreased by not more than 5 % in order to produce round sum amounts in the national currencies.\n10.   Where, on its balance sheet date, an undertaking or a group exceeds or ceases to exceed the limits of two of the three criteria set out in paragraphs 1 to 7, that fact shall affect the application of the derogations provided for in this Directive only if it occurs in two consecutive financial years.\n11.   The balance sheet total referred to in paragraphs 1 to 7 of this Article shall consist of the total value of the assets in A to E under ‧Assets‧ in the layout set out in Annex III or of the assets in A to E in the layout set out in Annex IV.\n12.   When calculating the thresholds in paragraphs 1 to 7, Member States may require the inclusion of income from other sources for undertakings for which \"net turnover\" is not relevant. Member States may require parent undertakings to calculate their thresholds on a consolidated basis rather than on an individual basis. Member States may also require affiliated undertakings to calculate their thresholds on a consolidated or aggregated basis where such undertakings have been established for the sole purpose of avoiding the reporting of certain information.\n13.   In order to adjust for the effects of inflation, the Commission shall at least every five years review and, where appropriate, amend, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 49, the thresholds referred to in paragraphs 1 to 7 of this Article, taking into account measures of inflation as published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nCHAPTER 2\nGENERAL PROVISIONS AND PRINCIPLES\nArticle 4\nGeneral provisions\n1.   The annual financial statements shall constitute a composite whole and shall for all undertakings comprise, as a minimum, the balance sheet, the profit and loss account and the notes to the financial statements.\nMember States may require undertakings other than small undertakings to include other statements in the annual financial statements in addition to the documents referred to in the first subparagraph.\n2.   The annual financial statements shall be drawn up clearly and in accordance with the provisions of this Directive.\n3.   The annual financial statements shall give a true and fair view of the undertaking's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. Where the application of this Directive would not be sufficient to give a true and fair view of the undertaking's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss, such additional information as is necessary to comply with that requirement shall be given in the notes to the financial statements.\n4.   Where in exceptional cases the application of a provision of this Directive is incompatible with the obligation laid down in paragraph 3, that provision shall be disapplied in order to give a true and fair view of the undertaking's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. The disapplication of any such provision shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements together with an explanation of the reasons for it and of its effect on the undertaking's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss.\nThe Member States may define the exceptional cases in question and lay down the relevant special rules which are to apply in those cases.\n5.   Member States may require undertakings other than small undertakings to disclose information in their annual financial statements which is additional to that required pursuant to this Directive.\n6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 5, Member States may require small undertakings to prepare, disclose and publish information in the financial statements which goes beyond the requirements of this Directive, provided that any such information is gathered under a single filing system and the disclosure requirement is contained in the national tax legislation for the strict purposes of tax collection. The information required in accordance with this paragraph shall be included in the relevant part of the financial statements.\n7.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission any additional information they require in accordance with paragraph 6 upon the transposition of this Directive and when they introduce new requirements in accordance with paragraph 6 in national law.\n8.   Member States using electronic solutions for filing and publishing annual financial statements shall ensure that small undertakings are not required to publish, in accordance with Chapter 7, the additional disclosures required by national tax legislation, as referred to in paragraph 6.\nArticle 5\nGeneral disclosure\nThe document containing the financial statements shall state the name of the undertaking and the information prescribed by points (a) and (b) of Article 5 of Directive 2009/101/EC.\nArticle 6\nGeneral financial reporting principles\n1.   Items presented in the annual and consolidated financial statements shall be recognised and measured in accordance with the following general principles:\n(a)\nthe undertaking shall be presumed to be carrying on its business as a going concern;\n(b)\naccounting policies and measurement bases shall be applied consistently from one financial year to the next;\n(c)\nrecognition and measurement shall be on a prudent basis, and in particular:\n(i)\nonly profits made at the balance sheet date may be recognised,\n(ii)\nall liabilities arising in the course of the financial year concerned or in the course of a previous financial year shall be recognised, even if such liabilities become apparent only between the balance sheet date and the date on which the balance sheet is drawn up, and\n(iii)\nall negative value adjustments shall be recognised, whether the result of the financial year is a profit or a loss;\n(d)\namounts recognised in the balance sheet and profit and loss account shall be computed on the accrual basis;\n(e)\nthe opening balance sheet for each financial year shall correspond to the closing balance sheet for the preceding financial year;\n(f)\nthe components of asset and liability items shall be valued separately;\n(g)\nany set-off between asset and liability items, or between income and expenditure items, shall be prohibited;\n(h)\nitems in the profit and loss account and balance sheet shall be accounted for and presented having regard to the substance of the transaction or arrangement concerned;\n(i)\nitems recognised in the financial statements shall be measured in accordance with the principle of purchase price or production cost; and\n(j)\nthe requirements set out in this Directive regarding recognition, measurement, presentation, disclosure and consolidation need not be complied with when the effect of complying with them is immaterial.\n2.   Notwithstanding point (g) of paragraph 1, Member States may in specific cases permit or require undertakings to perform a set-off between asset and liability items, or between income and expenditure items, provided that the amounts which are set off are specified as gross amounts in the notes to the financial statements.\n3.   Member States may exempt undertakings from the requirements of point (h) of paragraph 1.\n4.   Member States may limit the scope of point (j) of paragraph 1 to presentation and disclosures.\n5.   In addition to those amounts recognised in accordance with point (c)(ii) of paragraph 1, Member States may permit or require the recognition of all foreseeable liabilities and potential losses arising in the course of the financial year concerned or in the course of a previous financial year, even if such liabilities or losses become apparent only between the balance sheet date and the date on which the balance sheet is drawn up.\nArticle 7\nAlternative measurement basis of fixed assets at revalued amounts\n1.   By way of derogation from point (i) of Article 6(1), Member States may permit or require, in respect of all undertakings or any classes of undertaking, the measurement of fixed assets at revalued amounts. Where national law provides for the revaluation basis of measurement, it shall define its content and limits and the rules for its application.\n2.   Where paragraph 1 is applied, the amount of the difference between measurement on a purchase price or production cost basis and measurement on a revaluation basis shall be entered in the balance sheet in the revaluation reserve under ‧Capital and reserves‧.\nThe revaluation reserve may be capitalised in whole or in part at any time.\nThe revaluation reserve shall be reduced where the amounts transferred to that reserve are no longer necessary for the implementation of the revaluation basis of accounting. The Member States may lay down rules governing the application of the revaluation reserve, provided that transfers to the profit and loss account from the revaluation reserve may be made only where the amounts transferred have been entered as an expense in the profit and loss account or reflect increases in value which have actually been realised. No part of the revaluation reserve may be distributed, either directly or indirectly, unless it represents a gain actually realised.\nSave as provided under the second and third subparagraphs of this paragraph, the revaluation reserve may not be reduced.\n3.   Value adjustments shall be calculated each year on the basis of the revalued amount. However, by way of derogation from Articles 9 and 13, Member States may permit or require that only the amount of the value adjustments arising as a result of the purchase price or production cost measurement basis be shown under the relevant items in the layouts set out in Annexes V and VI and that the difference arising as a result of the measurement on a revaluation basis under this Article be shown separately in the layouts.\nArticle 8\nAlternative measurement basis of fair value\n1.   By way of derogation from point (i) of Article 6(1) and subject to the conditions set out in this Article:\n(a)\nMember States shall permit or require, in respect of all undertakings or any classes of undertaking, the measurement of financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, at fair value; and\n(b)\nMember States may permit or require, in respect of all undertakings or any classes of undertaking, the measurement of specified categories of assets other than financial instruments at amounts determined by reference to fair value.\nSuch permission or requirement may be restricted to consolidated financial statements.\n2.   For the purpose of this Directive, commodity-based contracts that give either contracting party the right to settle in cash or some other financial instrument shall be considered to be derivative financial instruments, except where such contracts:\n(a)\nwere entered into and continue to meet the undertaking's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements at the time they were entered into and subsequently;\n(b)\nwere designated as commodity-based contracts at their inception; and\n(c)\nare expected to be settled by delivery of the commodity.\n3.   Point (a) of paragraph 1 shall apply only to the following liabilities:\n(a)\nliabilities held as part of a trading portfolio; and\n(b)\nderivative financial instruments.\n4.   Measurement according to point (a) of paragraph 1 shall not apply to the following:\n(a)\nnon-derivative financial instruments held to maturity;\n(b)\nloans and receivables originated by the undertaking and not held for trading purposes; and\n(c)\ninterests in subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures, equity instruments issued by the undertaking, contracts for contingent consideration in a business combination, and other financial instruments with such special characteristics that the instruments, according to what is generally accepted, are accounted for differently from other financial instruments.\n5.   By way of derogation from point (i) of Article 6(1), Member States may, in respect of any assets and liabilities which qualify as hedged items under a fair value hedge accounting system, or identified portions of such assets or liabilities, permit measurement at the specific amount required under that system.\n6.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 3 and 4, Member States may permit or require the recognition, measurement and disclosure of financial instruments in conformity with international accounting standards adopted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.\n7.   The fair value within the meaning of this Article shall be determined by reference to one of the following values:\n(a)\nin the case of financial instruments for which a reliable market can readily be identified, the market value. Where the market value is not readily identifiable for an instrument but can be identified for its components or for a similar instrument, the market value may be derived from that of its components or of the similar instrument;\n(b)\nin the case of financial instruments for which a reliable market cannot be readily identified, a value resulting from generally accepted valuation models and techniques, provided that such valuation models and techniques ensure a reasonable approximation of the market value.\nFinancial instruments that cannot be measured reliably by any of the methods described in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph shall be measured in accordance with the principle of purchase price or production cost in so far as measurement on that basis is possible.\n8.   Notwithstanding point (c) of Article 6(1), where a financial instrument is measured at fair value, a change in value shall be included in the profit and loss account, except in the following cases, where such a change shall be included directly in a fair value reserve:\n(a)\nthe instrument accounted for is a hedging instrument under a system of hedge accounting that allows some or all of the change in value not to be shown in the profit and loss account; or\n(b)\nthe change in value relates to an exchange difference arising on a monetary item that forms part of an undertaking's net investment in a foreign entity.\nMember States may permit or require a change in the value of an available for sale financial asset, other than a derivative financial instrument, to be included directly in a fair value reserve. That fair value reserve shall be adjusted when amounts shown therein are no longer necessary for the implementation of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph.\n9.   Notwithstanding point (c) of Article 6(1), Member States may permit or require, in respect of all undertakings or any classes of undertaking, that, where assets other than financial instruments are measured at fair value, a change in the value be included in the profit and loss account.\nCHAPTER 3\nBALANCE SHEET AND PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT\nArticle 9\nGeneral provisions concerning the balance sheet and the profit and loss account\n1.   The layout of the balance sheet and of the profit and loss account shall not be changed from one financial year to the next. Departures from that principle shall, however, be permitted in exceptional cases in order to give a true and fair view of the undertaking's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. Any such departure and the reasons therefor shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\n2.   In the balance sheet and in the profit and loss account the items set out in Annexes III to VI shall be shown separately in the order indicated. Member States shall permit a more detailed subdivision of those items, subject to adherence to the prescribed layouts. Member States shall permit the addition of subtotals and of new items, provided that the contents of such new items are not covered by any of the items in the prescribed layouts. Member States may require such subdivision or subtotals or new items.\n3.   The layout, nomenclature and terminology of items in the balance sheet and profit and loss account that are preceded by arabic numerals shall be adapted where the special nature of an undertaking so requires. Member States may require such adaptations for undertakings which form part of a particular economic sector.\nMember States may permit or require balance sheet and profit and loss account items that are preceded by arabic numerals to be combined where they are immaterial in amount for the purposes of giving a true and fair view of the undertaking's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss or where such combination makes for greater clarity, provided that the items so combined are dealt with separately in the notes to the financial statements.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, Member States may limit the undertaking's ability to depart from the layouts set out in Annexes III to VI to the extent that this is necessary in order for the financial statements to be filed electronically.\n5.   In respect of each balance sheet and profit and loss account item, the figure for the financial year to which the balance sheet and the profit and loss account relate and the figure relating to the corresponding item for the preceding financial year shall be shown. Where those figures are not comparable, Member States may require the figure for the preceding financial year to be adjusted. Any case of non-comparability or any adjustment of the figures shall be disclosed, with explanations, in the notes to the financial statements.\n6.   Member States may permit or require adaptation of the layout of the balance sheet and profit and loss account in order to include the appropriation of profit or the treatment of loss.\n7.   In respect of the treatment of participating interests in annual financial statements:\n(a)\nMember States may permit or require participating interests to be accounted for using the equity method as provided for in Article 27, taking account of the essential adjustments resulting from the particular characteristics of annual financial statements as compared to consolidated financial statements;\n(b)\nMember States may permit or require that the proportion of the profit or loss attributable to the participating interest be recognised in the profit and loss account only to the extent of the amount corresponding to dividends already received or the payment of which can be claimed; and\n(c)\nwhere the profit attributable to the participating interest and recognised in the profit and loss account exceeds the amount of dividends already received or the payment of which can be claimed, the amount of the difference shall be placed in a reserve which cannot be distributed to shareholders.\nArticle 10\nPresentation of the balance sheet\nFor the presentation of the balance sheet, Member States shall prescribe one or both of the layouts set out in Annexes III and IV. If a Member State prescribes both layouts, it shall permit undertakings to choose which of the prescribed layouts to adopt.\nArticle 11\nAlternative presentation of the balance sheet\nMember States may permit or require undertakings, or certain classes of undertaking, to present items on the basis of a distinction between current and non-current items in a different layout from that set out in Annexes III and IV, provided that the information given is at least equivalent to that otherwise to be provided in accordance with Annexes III and IV.\nArticle 12\nSpecial provisions relating to certain balance sheet items\n1.   Where an asset or liability relates to more than one layout item, its relationship to other items shall be disclosed either under the item where it appears or in the notes to the financial statements.\n2.   Own shares and shares in affiliated undertakings shall be shown only under the items prescribed for that purpose.\n3.   Whether particular assets are to be shown as fixed assets or current assets shall depend upon the purpose for which they are intended.\n4.   Rights to immovables and other similar rights as defined by national law shall be shown under ‧Land and buildings‧.\n5.   The purchase price or production cost or revalued amount, where Article 7(1) applies, of fixed assets with limited useful economic lives shall be reduced by value adjustments calculated to write off the value of such assets systematically over their useful economic lives.\n6.   Value adjustments to fixed assets shall be subject to the following:\n(a)\nMember States may permit or require value adjustments to be made in respect of financial fixed assets, so that they are valued at the lower figure to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date;\n(b)\nvalue adjustments shall be made in respect of fixed assets, whether their useful economic lives are limited or not, so that they are valued at the lower figure to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date if it is expected that the reduction in their value will be permanent;\n(c)\nthe value adjustments referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be charged to the profit and loss account and disclosed separately in the notes to the financial statements if they have not been shown separately in the profit and loss account;\n(d)\nmeasurement at the lower of the values provided for in points (a) and (b) may not continue if the reasons for which the value adjustments were made have ceased to apply; this provision shall not apply to value adjustments made in respect of goodwill.\n7.   Value adjustments shall be made in respect of current assets with a view to showing them at the lower market value or, in particular circumstances, another lower value to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date.\nMeasurement at the lower value provided for in the first subparagraph may not continue if the reasons for which the value adjustments were made no longer apply.\n8.   Member States may permit or require that interest on capital borrowed to finance the production of fixed or current assets be included within production costs, to the extent that it relates to the period of production. Any application of this provision shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\n9.   Member States may permit the purchase price or production cost of stocks of goods of the same category and all fungible items including investments to be calculated either on the basis of weighted average prices, on the basis of the ‧first in, first out‧ (FIFO) method, the ‧last in, first out‧ (LIFO) method, or a method reflecting generally accepted best practice.\n10.   Where the amount repayable on account of any debt is greater than the amount received, Member States may permit or require that the difference be shown as an asset. It shall be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements. The amount of that difference shall be written off by a reasonable amount each year and completely written off no later than at the time of repayment of the debt.\n11.   Intangible assets shall be written off over the useful economic life of the intangible asset.\nIn exceptional cases where the useful life of goodwill and development costs cannot be reliably estimated, such assets shall be written off within a maximum period set by the Member State. That maximum period shall not be shorter than five years and shall not exceed 10 years. An explanation of the period over which goodwill is written off shall be provided within the notes to the financial statements.\nWhere national law authorises the inclusion of costs of development under ‧Assets‧ and the costs of development have not been completely written off, Member States shall require that no distribution of profits take place unless the amount of the reserves available for distribution and profits brought forward is at least equal to that of the costs not written off.\nWhere national law authorises the inclusion of formation expenses under ‧Assets‧, they shall be written off within a period of maximum five years. In that case, Member States shall require that the third subparagraph apply mutatis mutandis to formation expenses.\nIn exceptional cases, the Member States may permit derogations from the third and fourth subparagraphs. Such derogations and the reasons therefor shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\n12.   Provisions shall cover liabilities the nature of which is clearly defined and which at the balance sheet date are either likely to be incurred or certain to be incurred, but uncertain as to their amount or as to the date on which they will arise.\nThe Member States may also authorise the creation of provisions intended to cover expenses the nature of which is clearly defined and which at the balance sheet date are either likely to be incurred or certain to be incurred, but uncertain as to their amount or as to the date on which they will arise.\nAt the balance sheet date, a provision shall represent the best estimate of the expenses likely to be incurred or, in the case of a liability, of the amount required to meet that liability. Provisions shall not be used to adjust the values of assets.\nArticle 13\nPresentation of the profit and loss account\n1.   For the presentation of the profit and loss account, Member States shall prescribe one or both of the layouts set out in Annexes V and VI. If a Member State prescribes both layouts, it may permit undertakings to choose which of the prescribed layouts to adopt.\n2.   By way of derogation from Article 4(1), Member States may permit or require all undertakings, or any classes of undertaking, to present a statement of their performance instead of the presentation of profit and loss items in accordance with Annexes V and VI, provided that the information given is at least equivalent to that otherwise required by Annexes V and VI.\nArticle 14\nSimplifications for small and medium-sized undertakings\n1.

Where use is made of this derogation, that fact shall be disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and reasons given.\n12.   Where assets and liabilities included in consolidated financial statements have been measured by undertakings included in the consolidation using bases differing from those used for the purposes of the consolidation, those assets and liabilities shall be re-measured in accordance with the bases used for the consolidation.

Where an undertaking included in a consolidation has an associated undertaking, that associated undertaking shall be shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate item with an appropriate heading.\n2.   When this Article is applied for the first time to an associated undertaking, that associated undertaking shall be shown in the consolidated balance sheet either:\n(a)\nat its book value calculated in accordance with the measurement rules laid down in Chapters 2 and 3. The difference between that value and the amount corresponding to the proportion of capital and reserves represented by the participating interest in that associated undertaking shall be disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. That difference shall be calculated as at the date on which that method is used for the first time; or\n(b)\nat an amount corresponding to the proportion of the associated undertaking's capital and reserves represented by the participating interest in that associated undertaking. The difference between that amount and the book value calculated in accordance with the measurement rules laid down in Chapters 2 and 3 shall be disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. That difference shall be calculated as at the date on which that method is used for the first time.\nA Member State may prescribe the application of one or other of the options provided for in points (a) and (b). In such cases, the consolidated balance sheet or the notes to the consolidated financial statements shall indicate which of those options has been used.\nIn addition, for the purposes of points (a) and (b), a Member State may permit or require the calculation of the difference as at the date of acquisition of the shares or, where they were acquired in two or more stages, as at the date on which the undertaking became an associated undertaking.\n3.   Where an associated undertaking's assets or liabilities have been valued by methods other than those used for consolidation in accordance with Article 24(11), they may, for the purpose of calculating the difference referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2, be revalued by the methods used for consolidation. Where such revaluation has not been carried out, that fact shall be disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. A Member State may require such revaluation.\n4.   The book value referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2, or the amount corresponding to the proportion of the associated undertaking's capital and reserves referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2, shall be increased or reduced by the amount of any variation which has taken place during the financial year in the proportion of the associated undertaking's capital and reserves represented by that participating interest; it shall be reduced by the amount of the dividends relating to that participating interest.\n5.   In so far as the positive difference referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 cannot be related to any category of assets or liabilities, it shall be treated in accordance with the rules applicable to the item ‧goodwill‧ as set out in point (d) of Article 12(6), the first subparagraph of Article 12(11), point (c) of Article 24(3), and Annex III and Annex IV.\n6.

The eliminations referred to in Article 24(7) shall be effected in so far as the facts are known or can be ascertained.\n8.

That obligation shall not apply to any undertaking governed by the law of a Member State which is a subsidiary or parent undertaking, where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe parent undertaking is subject to the laws of a Member State; and\n(b)\nthe payments to governments made by the undertaking are included in the consolidated report on payments to governments drawn up by that parent undertaking in accordance with Article 44.\nArticle 43\nContent of the report\n1.   Any payment, whether made as a single payment or as a series of related payments, need not be taken into account in the report if it is below EUR 100 000 within a financial year.\n2.   The report shall disclose the following information in relation to activities as described in points (1) and (2) of Article 41 in respect of the relevant financial year:\n(a)\nthe total amount of payments made to each government;\n(b)\nthe total amount per type of payment as specified in points (5)(a) to (g) of Article 41 made to each government;\n(c)\nwhere those payments have been attributed to a specific project, the total amount per type of payment as specified in point (5)(a) to (g) of Article 41, made for each such project and the total amount of payments for each such project.\nPayments made by the undertaking in respect of obligations imposed at entity level may be disclosed at the entity level rather than at project level.\n3.   Where payments in kind are made to a government, they shall be reported in value and, where applicable, in volume. Supporting notes shall be provided to explain how their value has been determined.\n4.   The disclosure of the payments referred to in this Article shall reflect the substance, rather than the form, of the payment or activity concerned. Payments and activities may not be artificially split or aggregated to avoid the application of this Directive.\n5.   In the case of those Member States which have not adopted the euro, the euro threshold identified in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency by:\n(a)\napplying the exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union as at the date of the entry into force of any Directive fixing that threshold, and\n(b)\nrounding to the nearest hundred.\nArticle 44\nConsolidated report on payments to governments\n1.   A Member State shall require any large undertaking or any public-interest entity active in the extractive industry or the logging of primary forests and governed by its national law to draw up a consolidated report on payments to governments in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 if that parent undertaking is under the obligation to prepare consolidated financial statements as laid down in Article 22(1) to (6).\nA parent undertaking is considered to be active in the extractive industry or the logging of primary forests if any of its subsidiary undertakings are active in the extractive industry or the logging of primary forests.\nThe consolidated report shall only include payments resulting from extractive operations and/or operations relating to the logging of primary forests.\n2.   The obligation to draw up the consolidated report referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to:\n(a)\na parent undertaking of a small group, as defined in Article 3(5), except where any affiliated undertaking is a public-interest entity;\n(b)\na parent undertaking of a medium-sized group, as defined in Article 3(6), except where any affiliated undertaking is a public-interest entity; and\n(c)\na parent undertaking governed by the law of a Member State which is also a subsidiary undertaking, if its own parent undertaking is governed by the law of a Member State.\n3.   An undertaking, including a public-interest entity, need not be included in a consolidated report on payments to governments where at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n(a)\nsevere long-term restrictions substantially hinder the parent undertaking in the exercise of its rights over the assets or management of that undertaking;\n(b)\nextremely rare cases where the information necessary for the preparation of the consolidated report on payments to governments in accordance with this Directive cannot be obtained without disproportionate expense or undue delay;\n(c)\nthe shares of that undertaking are held exclusively with a view to their subsequent resale.\nThe above exemptions shall apply only if they are also used for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements.\nArticle 45\nPublication\n1.   The report referred to in Article 42 and the consolidated report referred to in Article 44 on payments to governments shall be published as laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Chapter 2 of Directive 2009/101/EC.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the members of the responsible bodies of an undertaking, acting within the competences assigned to them by national law, have responsibility for ensuring that, to the best of their knowledge and ability, the report on payments to governments is drawn up and published in accordance with the requirements of this Directive.\nArticle 46\nEquivalence criteria\n1.   Undertakings referred to in Articles 42 and 44 that prepare and make public a report complying with third-country reporting requirements assessed, in accordance with Article 47, as equivalent to the requirements of this Chapter are exempt from the requirements of this Chapter except for the obligation to publish this report as laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Chapter 2 of Directive 2009/101/EC.\n2.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 49 identifying the criteria to be applied when assessing, for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the equivalence of third-country reporting requirements and the requirements of this Chapter.\n3.   The criteria identified by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 2 shall:\n(a)\ninclude the following:\n(i)\ntarget undertakings,\n(ii)\ntarget recipients of payments,\n(iii)\npayments captured,\n(iv)\nattribution of payments captured,\n(v)\nbreakdown of payments captured,\n(vi)\ntriggers for reporting on a consolidated basis,\n(vii)\nreporting medium,\n(viii)\nfrequency of reporting, and\n(ix)\nanti-evasion measures;\n(b)\notherwise be limited to criteria which facilitate a direct comparison of third-country reporting requirements with the requirements of this Chapter.\nArticle 47\nApplication of equivalence criteria\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing acts identifying those third-country reporting requirements which, after applying the equivalence criteria identified in accordance with Article 46, it considers equivalent to the requirements of this Chapter. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 50(2).\nArticle 48\nReview\nThe Commission shall review and report on the implementation and effectiveness of this Chapter, in particular as regards the scope of, and compliance with, the reporting obligations and the modalities of the reporting on a project basis.\nThe review shall take into account international developments, in particular with regard to enhancing transparency of payments to governments, assess the impacts of other international regimes and consider the effects on competitiveness and security of energy supply. It shall be completed by 21 July 2018.\nThe report shall be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate. That report shall consider the extension of the reporting requirements to additional industry sectors and whether the report on payments to governments should be audited. The report shall also consider the disclosure of additional information on the average number of employees, the use of subcontractors and any pecuniary penalties administered by a country.\nIn addition, the report shall analyse the feasibility of the introduction of an obligation for all Union issuers to carry out due diligence when sourcing minerals to ensure that supply chains have no connection to conflict parties and respect the EITI and OECD recommendations on responsible supply chain management.\nCHAPTER 11\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 49\nExercise of delegated powers\n1.

"Comparable and clear company financial statements across the EU\nComparable and clear company financial statements across the EU\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2013/34/EU on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of businesses\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt aims to:\nensure the clarity and comparability of financial statements, other than international financial reporting standards (IFRS);\nlimit administrative burdens and provide for simple and robust accounting rules, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\nincrease transparency of the payments made by the mining and logging industries to governments, and of the corporate taxes paid by very large multinational groups.\nKEY POINTS\nThe legislation applies to limited liability types of companies in the European Union (EU).\nThe legislation defines and differentiates between micro-, small, medium-sized and large companies, based on: their balance sheet;their net turnover; andthe average number of employees during a financial year.\nFor each category, it sets three limits, two of which must not be exceeded: micro-undertakings: balance sheet (€350,000), net turnover (€700,000), employees (10);small undertakings: balance sheet (€4 million), net turnover (€8 million), employees (50);medium-sized undertakings: balance sheet (€20 million), net turnover (€40 million), employees (250);large undertakings: balance sheet (€20 million), net turnover (€40 million), employees (250).\nAnnual financial statements must: contain, as a minimum, the balance sheet, the profit and loss account and the notes to the financial statements*;give a true and fair view of the company’s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss;be published by each company in the relevant national business register.\nThe directive sets out general financial reporting principles, such as consistent application of accounting policies and measurement bases from one year to the next.\nDetailed rules cover the presentation of the balance sheets, profit and loss accounts and the notes to the financial statements, as well as management reports, non-financial information, corporate governance and consolidated statements.\nThe obligations may vary depending on a company’s size, and the directive allows for exemptions or simplifications in many areas for micro-undertakings and SMEs. It is up to each EU Member State to decide on the extent of these exemptions and simplifications.\nThe financial statements of public interest entities and medium-sized and large undertakings must be audited by one or more statutory auditors.\nLarge companies involved in mining minerals, oil, natural gas or other materials or involved in logging in primary forests* must publish details of payments over €100,000 in total that they have made to governments in any financial year.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2021/2101 inserts a new chapter (10a) in Directive 2013/34/EU concerning the disclosure of income tax information by multinational groups with annual consolidated revenue of more than €750 million: the parent companies of such groups will be required to declare, in a specific report published on their website, their revenues, the profits they have made, the corporate income tax paid and the number of employees per Member State, and per non-EU country that does not cooperate with the EU on tax matters or that does not meet all standards and has committed to reform;business registers will also provide public access to these reports;non-EU country multinational groups doing business in the EU are required to report similarly.\nDirective 2013/34/EU repeals earlier accounting directives (78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC) and amends Directive 2006/43/EC (see summary).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2013/34/EU has applied since 19 July 2013 and had to become law in the Member States by 20 July 2015.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2021/2101 has to become law in the Member States by 22 June 2023.\nBACKGROUND\nThe directive is part of the European Commission’s better regulation programme. This emphasises the importance of quality legislation that ensures administrative burdens are proportionate to the benefits they bring.\nFor further information, see: Company reporting (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nNotes to the financial statements. Additional information to that contained in a company’s financial statements.
