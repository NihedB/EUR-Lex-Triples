{"celex_id": "32009R0469", "reference": "16.6.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 152/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 469/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 6 May 2009\nconcerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products\n(Codified version)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nPharmaceutical research plays a decisive role in the continuing improvement in public health.\n(3)\nMedicinal products, especially those that are the result of long, costly research will not continue to be developed in the Community and in Europe unless they are covered by favourable rules that provide for sufficient protection to encourage such research.\n(4)\nAt the moment, the period that elapses between the filing of an application for a patent for a new medicinal product and authorisation to place the medicinal product on the market makes the period of effective protection under the patent insufficient to cover the investment put into the research.\n(5)\nThis situation leads to a lack of protection which penalises pharmaceutical research.\n(6)\nThere exists a risk of research centres situated in the Member States relocating to countries that offer greater protection.\n(7)\nA uniform solution at Community level should be provided for, thereby preventing the heterogeneous development of national laws leading to further disparities which would be likely to create obstacles to the free movement of medicinal products within the Community and thus directly affect the functioning of the internal market.\n(8)\nTherefore, the provision of a supplementary protection certificate granted, under the same conditions, by each of the Member States at the request of the holder of a national or European patent relating to a medicinal product for which marketing authorisation has been granted is necessary. A regulation is therefore the most appropriate legal instrument.\n(9)\nThe duration of the protection granted by the certificate should be such as to provide adequate effective protection. For this purpose, the holder of both a patent and a certificate should be able to enjoy an overall maximum of 15 years of exclusivity from the time the medicinal product in question first obtains authorisation to be placed on the market in the Community.\n(10)\nAll the interests at stake, including those of public health, in a sector as complex and sensitive as the pharmaceutical sector should nevertheless be taken into account. For this purpose, the certificate cannot be granted for a period exceeding five years. The protection granted should furthermore be strictly confined to the product which obtained authorisation to be placed on the market as a medicinal product.\n(11)\nProvision should be made for appropriate limitation of the duration of the certificate in the special case where a patent term has already been extended under a specific national law,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘medicinal product’ means any substance or combination of substances presented for treating or preventing disease in human beings or animals and any substance or combination of substances which may be administered to human beings or animals with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions in humans or in animals;\n(b)\n‘product’ means the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients of a medicinal product;\n(c)\n‘basic patent’ means a patent which protects a product as such, a process to obtain a product or an application of a product, and which is designated by its holder for the purpose of the procedure for grant of a certificate;\n(d)\n‘certificate’ means the supplementary protection certificate;\n(e)\n‘application for an extension of the duration’ means an application for an extension of the duration of the certificate pursuant to Article 13(3) of this Regulation and Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use (5).\nArticle 2\nScope\nAny product protected by a patent in the territory of a Member State and subject, prior to being placed on the market as a medicinal product, to an administrative authorisation procedure as laid down in Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (6) or Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (7) may, under the terms and conditions provided for in this Regulation, be the subject of a certificate.\nArticle 3\nConditions for obtaining a certificate\nA certificate shall be granted if, in the Member State in which the application referred to in Article 7 is submitted and at the date of that application:\n(a)\nthe product is protected by a basic patent in force;\n(b)\na valid authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product has been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or Directive 2001/82/EC, as appropriate;\n(c)\nthe product has not already been the subject of a certificate;\n(d)\nthe authorisation referred to in point (b) is the first authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product.\nArticle 4\nSubject matter of protection\nWithin the limits of the protection conferred by the basic patent, the protection conferred by a certificate shall extend only to the product covered by the authorisation to place the corresponding medicinal product on the market and for any use of the product as a medicinal product that has been authorised before the expiry of the certificate.\nArticle 5\nEffects of the certificate\nSubject to the provisions of Article 4, the certificate shall confer the same rights as conferred by the basic patent and shall be subject to the same limitations and the same obligations.\nArticle 6\nEntitlement to the certificate\nThe certificate shall be granted to the holder of the basic patent or his successor in title.\nArticle 7\nApplication for a certificate\n1.   The application for a certificate shall be lodged within six months of the date on which the authorisation referred to in Article 3(b) to place the product on the market as a medicinal product was granted.\n2.

The overall protection a patent and an SPC can provide may not be more than 15 years from the granting of the first marketing authorisation.\nThe SPC may be extended once for 6 months for pharmaceutical products for children where a paediatric investigation plan has been prepared. The overall protection provided is then 15,5 years.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\nRegulation (EC) No 1610/96 has applied since 8 February 1997, except in those countries whose national law did not cover the patentability of plant protection products, where it has applied since 2 January 1998.\nRegulation (EC) No 469/2009 codifies Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92. It has applied since 6 July 2009.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2019/933 has applied since 1 July 2019.\nBACKGROUND\nThe time between applying for a patent for a new pharmaceutical or plant protection product and receiving authorisation to place it on the market reduces the effective period of patent protection. The SPC aims to offset that reduction in the effective patent protection in these fields of research to encourage innovation and prevent these industries moving away from EU countries.\nFor more information, see: Supplementary protection certificates (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nSupplementary protection certificate: an intellectual property right for a specific product that acts as an extension of a patent.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1610/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products (OJ L 198, 8.8.1996, pp. 30-35)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 have been incorporated into the basic text.
