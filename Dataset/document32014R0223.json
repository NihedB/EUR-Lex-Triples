{"celex_id": "32014R0223", "reference": "12.3.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 72/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 223/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 March 2014\non the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 175(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn line with the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June 2010, whereby the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ('Europe 2020 strategy') was adopted, the Union and the Member States have set themselves the objective of having at least 20 million fewer people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by 2020. Nonetheless, in 2011, nearly one quarter of people living in the Union (119,82 million) were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, approximately 4 million people more than in the previous year. However, poverty and social exclusion are not uniform across the Union and their gravity varies between the Member States.\n(2)\nThe number of persons suffering from material, or even severe material, deprivation in the Union is increasing and in 2011 nearly 8,8 % of Union citizens lived in conditions of severe material deprivation. In addition, those persons are often too excluded to benefit from the activation measures of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), and, in particular of Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).\n(3)\nMember States and the Commission should take appropriate steps to prevent any discrimination and should ensure equality between men and women and the coherent integration of the gender perspective at all stages of the preparation, the programming, management and implementation, the monitoring and the evaluation of the a Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (the 'Fund'), as well as in information and awareness raising campaigns and the exchange of best practices.\n(4)\nArticle 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) emphasises that the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.\n(5)\nArticle 6 TEU emphasises that the Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(6)\nArticle 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that in order to promote its overall harmonious development, the Union is to develop and pursue actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion.\n(7)\nThe Fund should strengthen social cohesion by contributing to the reduction of poverty, and ultimately the eradication of the worst forms of poverty, in the Union by supporting national schemes that provide non-financial assistance to alleviate food and severe material deprivation and/or contribute to the social inclusion of the most deprived persons. The Fund should alleviate the forms of extreme poverty with the greatest social exclusion impact, such as homelessness, child poverty and food deprivation.\n(8)\nThe Fund is not meant to replace public policies undertaken by the Member States to fight poverty and social exclusion, in particular policies which are necessary to prevent the marginalisation of vulnerable and low-income groups and to avert the increased risk of poverty and social exclusion.\n(9)\nUnder Article 317 TFEU, and in the context of shared management, the conditions allowing the Commission to exercise its responsibilities for implementation of the general budget of the Union should be specified and the responsibilities in terms of cooperation by the Member States clarified. Those conditions should enable the Commission to obtain assurance that Member States are using the Fund in a legal and regular manner and in accordance with the principle of sound financial management within the meaning of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) ('the Financial Regulation').\n(10)\nThose provisions also ensure that the operations supported shall comply with applicable Union and related national law which directly or indirectly implements this Regulation, as well as policies, in particular as regards the safety of food and/or basic material assistance distributed to the most deprived persons.\n(11)\nThe allocation of the appropriations of the Fund between the Member States for the 2014-2020 period takes into account in equal measure the following indicators assessed on the basis of data from Eurostat on the population suffering from severe material deprivation and the population living in households with very low work intensity. Furthermore, the allocation also takes into account the different ways of assisting the most deprived persons in the Member States. However, each Member State should be allocated the minimum amount of 3 500 000 EUR for the 2014-2020 programming period in order to set an operational programme with a meaningful level of resources.\n(12)\nThe Member State's allocation for the Fund should be deducted from the Member State Structural Funds allocation.\n(13)\nThe operational programmes of Member States should identify and justify the forms of food and/or material deprivation to be addressed and/or social inclusion activities to be supported, and should describe features of the assistance to the most deprived persons that will be provided through the Fund's support for national schemes. It should also include elements necessary to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the operational programmes.\n(14)\nSevere food deprivation in the Union coincides with significant food wastage. In this respect, the Fund should facilitate food donations, where appropriate. However, this is without prejudging the need to remove existing obstacles in order to encourage donations of excess food for the purposes of combating food deprivation.\n(15)\nWith a view to ensuring the effective and efficient implementation of the measures financed from the Fund, Member States should, where appropriate, promote cooperation between regional and local authorities and bodies representing civil society and the participation by all those involved in drawing up and implementing activities financed from the Fund.\n(16)\nIn order to maximise the effectiveness of the Fund, in particular as regards possible changes in the national circumstances, it is appropriate to establish a procedure to amend an operational programme.\n(17)\nThe partnership principle should apply in order to respond in the most effective and adequate manner to the various needs and to better reach out to the most deprived persons.\n(18)\nExchanges of experience and best practices have a significant added value because they facilitate mutual learning. The Commission should facilitate and promote their dissemination, while seeking synergies with the exchange of best practices in the context of related Funds, in particular the European Social Fund (ESF).\n(19)\nIn order to monitor the progress of implementation of operational programmes, Member States should draw up and provide to the Commission annual and final implementation reports. This should ensure the availability of essential and up-to-date information for those operational programmes. For the same purposes, the Commission and each Member State should meet every year to carry out a review, unless they agree otherwise. Relevant stakeholders should be involved in the monitoring in an appropriate way.\n(20)\nIn order to improve the quality and design of each operational programme and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Fund, ex ante and ex post evaluations should be carried out. Those evaluations should be based upon relevant data and supplemented, where relevant, by surveys on the most deprived persons who have benefited from the operational programme and, if necessary, by evaluations during the programming period. Those evaluations should also respect the privacy of end recipients and be carried out in such a way as not to stigmatise the most deprived persons. The responsibilities of Member States and the Commission in this respect should be specified.\n(21)\nIn evaluating the Fund and in developing the evaluation methodology it should be borne in mind that deprivation is a complex concept of a multi-dimensional nature.\n(22)\nCitizens have the right to know how the Union's financial resources are invested and to what effect. For the purpose of ensuring wide dissemination of information about the achievements of the Fund and to ensure accessibility and transparency of funding opportunities, detailed rules about information and communication, especially in relation to the responsibilities of the beneficiaries, the Member States and, where relevant, local and regional authorities should be established.\n(23)\nUnion law concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) is applicable.\n(24)\nIt is necessary to establish a maximum level of co-financing from the Fund to the operational programmes to provide for a multiplier effect of Union resources. In addition the situation of Member States facing temporary budget difficulties should be addressed.\n(25)\nUniform, simple and equitable rules on the eligibility period, operations and expenditures for the Fund should be applied across the Union. The conditions of eligibility should reflect the specific nature of the Fund's objectives and target populations, in particular through adequate and simplified conditions of eligibility of the operations as well as forms of support and rules and conditions of reimbursement.\n(26)\nTaking into account the date by which invitations to tender have to be issued, the time limits for adoption of this Regulation and the time needed for the preparation of operational programmes, rules should be put in place to permit a smooth transition so that there is no interruption in the supply of food aid. To this end, it is appropriate to allow eligibility of expenditure from 1 December 2013.\n(27)\nRegulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) provides that products bought under public intervention may be disposed of by making them available for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived in the Union if that scheme so provides. Given that, depending on the circumstances, obtaining food from the use, processing or sale of those products is the most economically favourable option, it is appropriate to provide for such a possibility in this Regulation. The amounts derived from a transaction concerning such products should be used for the benefit of the most deprived persons. Those amounts should not be applied so as to diminish the obligation of the Member States to co-finance the programme. To ensure the most efficient possible use of those products and their proceeds, the Commission should adopt implementing acts in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 establishing procedures by which those products may be used, processed or sold for the purposes of the most deprived persons programme.\n(28)\nIt is necessary to specify the types of actions that can be undertaken at the initiative of the Commission and of the Member States as technical assistance supported by the Fund. The Commission should consult the Member States and representatives of partner organisations at Union level for this purpose.\n(29)\nIn accordance with the principle of shared management, Member States and the Commission should be responsible for the management and control of programmes. Member States should have the primary responsibility, through their management and control system, for the implementation and control of their operational programme.\n(30)\nMember States should adopt adequate measures to guarantee the proper set up and functioning of their management and control systems to give assurance on the legal and regular use of the Fund. The obligations of Member States as regards the management and control systems of their operational programmes, and in relation to the prevention, detection and correction of irregularities and breaches of Union law should therefore be specified.\n(31)\nMember States should fulfil the management, control and audit obligations and assume the responsibilities as laid down in the rules on shared management set out in this Regulation and in the Financial Regulation. Member States should ensure that, in accordance with the conditions set out in this Regulation, effective arrangements for the examination of complaints in relation to the Fund are in place. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States should, upon request of the Commission, examine complaints submitted to the Commission falling within the scope of their arrangements and should inform the Commission of the results of examinations upon request.\n(32)\nMember States should designate a managing authority, a certifying authority and a functionally independent auditing authority for each operational programme. To provide flexibility for Member States in setting up control systems, it is appropriate to provide for the option for the functions of the certifying authority to be carried out by the managing authority. Member States should also be allowed to designate intermediate bodies to carry out certain tasks of the managing authority or the certifying authority. Member States should in that case lay down clearly their respective responsibilities and functions.\n(33)\nThe managing authority bears the main responsibility for the effective and efficient implementation of the Fund and thus fulfils a substantial number of functions related to operational programme management and monitoring, financial management and controls as well as project selection. Accordingly, the managing authority's responsibilities and functions should be set out in this Regulation.\n(34)\nThe certifying authority should draw up and submit to the Commission payment applications. It should draw up the accounts, certifying their completeness, accuracy and veracity and that the expenditure entered in the accounts complies with applicable Union and national rules. The certifying authority's responsibilities and functions should be set out in this Regulation.\n(35)\nThe audit authority should ensure that audits are carried out on the management and control systems, on an appropriate sample of operations and on the accounts. The audit authority's responsibilities and functions should be set out in this Regulation. Audits of declared expenditure should be carried out on a representative sample of operations in order to enable the results to be extrapolated. As a general rule, a statistical sampling method should be used in order to provide a reliable representative sample. Nevertheless, audit authorities should be able to use in duly justified circumstances a non-statistical sampling method or substantive testing, provided that the conditions laid down in this Regulation are complied with.\n(36)\nIn order to take account of the specific organisation of the management and control systems for the Fund and the need to ensure a proportionate approach, specific provisions should be laid down in relation to the designation of the managing authority and the certifying authority. In order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden, the ex ante verification of compliance with the designation criteria indicated in this Regulation should be limited to the managing and certifying authority. There should be no requirement to approve the designation by the Commission. The monitoring of compliance with the designation criteria carried out on the basis of audit and control arrangements should, where results show non-compliance with the criteria, give rise to remedial actions, and possibly to the ending of the designation.\n(37)\nWithout prejudice to the Commission's powers as regards financial control, cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in the framework of this Regulation should be ensured and criteria should be established which allow the Commission to determine, in the context of its strategy of control of national systems, the level of assurance it should obtain from national audit bodies.\n(38)\nThe powers and responsibilities of the Commission with regard to verifying the effective functioning of the management and control systems, and to require Member State action, should be laid down. The Commission should also have the power to carry out on-the-spot audits focused on issues relating to sound financial management in order to draw conclusions on the performance of the Fund.\n(39)\nBudget commitments of the Union should be effected annually. In order to ensure effective programme management, it is necessary to lay down simple rules for pre-financing, interim requests for payment and the final balance.\n(40)\nWith a view to ensuring reasonable assurance for the Commission prior to the acceptance of accounts, applications for interim payment should be reimbursed at a rate of 90 % of the amount resulting from applying the co-financing rate laid down in the decision adopting the operational programme, to the eligible expenditure. The outstanding amounts due should be paid to the Member States upon acceptance of accounts, provided that the Commission is able to conclude that the accounts are complete, accurate and true.\n(41)\nA pre-financing payment at the start of the operational programme should ensure that the Member State has the means to provide support to the beneficiaries in the implementation of the operations starting from the adoption of the operational programme. This pre-financing should be used exclusively for this purpose and so that beneficiaries should receive enough funding to start up an operation upon its selection.\n(42)\nBeneficiaries should receive the support in full no later than 90 days from the date of submission of the payment claim by the beneficiary, subject to the availability of funding from pre-financing and interim payments. The managing authority should be able to interrupt the deadline where supporting documents are incomplete or there is evidence of irregularity requiring further investigation.\n(43)\nIn order to safeguard the Union's financial interests, measures should be provided for that are limited in time that allow the authorising officer by delegation to interrupt payments where there is clear evidence to suggest a significant deficiency in the functioning of the management and control system, evidence of irregularities linked to a request for payment, or a failure to submit documents for the purpose of the examination and acceptance of accounts. The duration of the interruption period should be for a period of up to six months, with a possible extension of that period up to nine months with the agreement of the Member State, to allow sufficient time to resolve the causes of the interruption thereby avoiding the application of suspensions.\n(44)\nIn order to safeguard the Union's financial interests and provide the means to ensure effective programme implementation, provisions should be laid down allowing for the suspension by the Commission of payments.\n(45)\nIn order to apply the requirements of the Financial Regulation to the financial management of the Fund, it is necessary to set out simple procedures for the preparation, examination and acceptance of accounts which should ensure a clear basis and legal certainty for these arrangements. In addition, in order to allow a Member State properly to fulfil its responsibilities, it should be possible for the Member State to exclude amounts which are the subject of an ongoing assessment of legality and regularity.\n(46)\nTo reduce the risk of irregular expenditure being declared, it should be possible for a certifying authority, without any need for additional justification, to include the amounts which require further verification in an interim payment application after the accounting year in which they were entered into its accounting system.\n(47)\nIn order to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries, specific time limits should be set out during which the managing authorities are obliged to ensure the availability of documents for operations following submission of expenditure or completion of an operation. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the period for keeping the documents should be differentiated depending on the total eligible expenditure of an operation.\n(48)\nAs accounts are verified and accepted every year, the closure procedure should be simple. The final closure of the programme should therefore be based only on the documents relating to the final accounting year and the final implementation report or the last annual implementation report, without any need to provide any additional documents.\n(49)\nIn order to safeguard the budget of the Union, it is possible that it would be necessary for the Commission to make financial corrections. To ensure legal certainty for the Member States, it is important to define the circumstances under which breaches of the applicable Union law or national law related to its application can lead to financial corrections by the Commission. In order to ensure that any financial corrections which the Commission imposes on Member States are related to the protection of the Union's financial interests, such corrections should be confined to cases where the breach of applicable Union law or national law related to applying relevant Union law concerns the eligibility, regularity, management or control of operations and the corresponding expenditure declared to the Commission. To ensure proportionality it is important that the Commission considers the nature and the gravity of the breach and the related financial implications for the budget of the Union when deciding on a financial correction.\n(50)\nIt is necessary to establish a legal framework which provides robust management and control systems and an appropriate division of roles and responsibilities in the context of shared management. The role of the Commission should therefore be specified and clarified and proportionate rules set out for the application of financial corrections by the Commission.\n(51)\nThe frequency of audits on operations should be proportionate to the extent of the Union's support from the Fund. In particular, the number of audits carried out should be reduced where the total eligible expenditure for an operation does not exceed EUR 150 000. Nevertheless, it should be possible to carry out audits at any time where there is evidence of an irregularity or fraud, or following closure of a completed operation, as part of an audit sample. The Commission should be able to review the audit trail of the audit authority or take part in on-the-spot audits of the audit authority. Where the Commission does not obtain the necessary assurance as to the effective functioning of the audit authority by those means, the Commission should be able to carry out a re-performance of the audit activity where this is in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. In order that the level of auditing by the Commission is proportionate to the risk, the Commission should be able to reduce its audit work in relation to operational programmes where there are no significant deficiencies or where the audit authority can be relied on. In order to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries, specific rules should be introduced to reduce the risk of overlap between audits of the same operations by various institutions, namely the European Court of Auditors, the Commission and the audit authority. In addition, the scope of audits should take fully into account the objective and the features of the target populations of the Fund, as well as the voluntary character of many beneficiaries.\n(52)\nIn order to ensure financial discipline, it is appropriate to define the arrangements for de-commitment of any part of the budget commitment in an operational programme, in particular where an amount may be excluded from de-commitment, in particular where delays in implementation result from circumstances which are independent of the party concerned, abnormal or unforeseeable and whose consequences cannot be avoided despite the diligence shown, as well as in a situation in which a request for payment has been made but for which the payment deadline has been interrupted or the payment suspended.\n(53)\nIn order to supplement and amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the content of the annual and final implementation reports, including the list of common indicators, the criteria for determining the cases of irregularity to be reported, the data to be provided and the recovery of sums unduly paid, the rules specifying the information in relation to the data to be recorded and stored in computerised form within the monitoring systems established by managing authorities, the minimum requirements for audit trails, the scope and content of national audits and methodology for sampling, the detailed rules on the use of data collected during audits, and the criteria for determining serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of management and control systems, for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied and for applying flat-rates or extrapolated financial corrections. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(54)\nThe Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council\n(55)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards decisions on annual plans of actions to be financed from technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission, adopting and amending operational programmes, decisions suspending interim payments, decisions on the non-acceptance of the accounts and the amount chargeable, if the accounts were not accepted, decisions on financial corrections decisions setting out the annual breakdown of the commitment appropriations to the Member States, and, in the case of decommitment, decisions to amend decisions adopting programmes.\n(56)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the template for the structured survey on end recipients, the frequency of reporting of irregularities and the reporting format to be used, the terms and conditions for the electronic data exchange system for management and control, the technical specifications of recording and data-storing in relation to the management and control system, the model for the management declaration, the models for the audit strategy, audit opinion and control report, the model for the report and opinion of the independent audit body and description of the functions and procedures in place for the management authority and, where appropriate, the certifying authority, the model for payment applications, and the model for accounts. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n(57)\nFor certain implementing acts to be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 the potential impact and implications are of such a high significance to Member States that an exception from the general rule is justified. Accordingly, where no opinion is delivered by the committee, the Commission should not adopt the draft implementing act. Those implementing acts relate to laying down technical specifications of recording and data storing in relation to the management and control system. The third subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 should therefore apply to those implementing acts.\n(58)\nThis Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including respect for human dignity and for private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, the rights of the child, the rights of the elderly, equality between men and women, and the prohibition of discrimination. This Regulation should be applied according to those rights and principles.\n(59)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to improve social cohesion in the Union and contribute to the fight against poverty and social exclusion, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(60)\nIt should be ensured that the Fund complements actions that are funded under the ESF as social inclusion activities, while exclusively supporting the most deprived persons.\n(61)\nIn order to allow for the prompt adoption of the delegated acts provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and purpose\nThis Regulation establishes the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived ('the Fund') for the period from 1 January

persons, combined where applicable with accompanying measures, aimed at alleviating the social exclusion of most deprived persons;\n(6)\n'social inclusion of the most deprived persons operational programme' (also referred to as 'OP II') means an operational programme supporting the activities outside active labour market measures, consisting in non-financial, non-material assistance, aimed at the social inclusion of the most deprived persons;\n(7)\n'operation' means a project, contract or action selected by the managing authority of the operational programme concerned, or under its responsibility, contributing to the objectives of the operational programme to which it relates;\n(8)\n'completed operation' means an operation that has been physically completed or fully implemented

The Fund shall promote social cohesion, enhance social inclusion and therefore ultimately contribute to the objective of eradicating poverty in the Union by contributing to achieving the poverty reduction target of at least 20 million of the number of persons at risk of poverty and social exclusion in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy, whilst complementing the Structural Funds. The Fund shall contribute to achieving the specific objective of alleviating the worst forms of poverty, by providing non-financial assistance to the most deprived persons by food and/or basic material assistance, and social inclusion activities aiming at the social integration of the most deprived persons.\nThis objective and the results of the implementation of the Fund shall be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed.\n2.   The Fund shall complement sustainable national poverty eradication and social inclusion policies, which remain the responsibility of Member States.\nArticle 4\nScope of support\n1.   The Fund shall support national schemes whereby food and/or basic material assistance, are distributed to the most deprived persons through partner organisations selected by Member States.\nWith the view to augmenting and diversifying the supply of food for the most deprived persons, as well as reducing and preventing food wastage, the Fund may support activities related to the collection, transport, storage and distribution of food donations.\nThe Fund may also support accompanying measures, complementing the provision of food and/or basic material assistance.\n2.   The Fund shall support activities contributing to the social inclusion of the most deprived persons.\n3.   The Fund shall promote, at Union level, mutual learning, networking and dissemination of good practices in the area of non-financial assistance to the most deprived persons.\nArticle 5\nPrinciples\n1.   The part of the budget of the Union allocated to the Fund shall be implemented within the framework of shared management between the Member States and the Commission, in accordance with point (b) of Article 58(1) of the Financial Regulation, with the exception of technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission, which shall be implemented in the framework of direct management in accordance with point (a) of Article 58(1) of the Financial Regulation.\n2.   The Commission and the Member States shall ensure, taking account of the specific context of each Member State, that support from the Fund is consistent with the relevant policies and priorities of the Union and complementary to other instruments of the Union.\n3.   Support from the Fund shall be implemented in close co-operation between the Commission and the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.\n4.   Member States and the bodies designated by them for that purpose, shall be responsible for implementing the operational programmes and carrying out their tasks under this Regulation in accordance with the institutional, legal and financial framework of the Member State and subject to compliance with this Regulation.\n5.   Arrangements for the implementation and use of the Fund, and in particular the financial and administrative resources required in relation to reporting, evaluation, management and control shall take into account the principle of proportionality having regard to the level of support allocated and the limited administrative capacity of the organisations that function thanks mainly to volunteers.\n6.   In accordance with their respective responsibilities, and to prevent double funding, the Commission and the Member States shall ensure coordination with the ESF, and with other relevant Union policies, strategies and instruments, in particular Union initiatives in the field of public health and against food waste.\n7.   The Commission and the Member States and the beneficiaries shall apply the principle of sound financial management in accordance with Article 30 of the Financial Regulation.\n8.   The Commission and the Member States shall ensure the effectiveness of the Fund, in particular through monitoring, reporting and evaluation.\n9.   The Member States and the Commission shall ensure that the operational programmes are prepared, programmed, implemented, monitored and evaluated, respecting the partnership principle, when carrying out the consultations of relevant stakeholders as set out in this Regulation.\n10.

On the basis of the accepted accounts the Commission shall calculate the amount chargeable to the Fund for the accounting year and the consequent adjustments in relation to the payments to the Member State. The Commission shall take into account:\n(i)\nthe amounts in the accounts referred to in point (a) of Article 49(1), and to which the co-financing rate defined in Article 20 is to be applied;\n(ii)\nthe total amount of payments made by the Commission during that accounting year, consisting of the amount of interim payments paid by the Commission in accordance with Article 21 and Article 40(1).\n7.   After the calculation carried out under paragraph 6 of this Article, the Commission shall pay any additional amount due within 30 days of the acceptance of the accounts. Where there is an amount recoverable from the Member State, it shall be subject to a recovery order issued by the Commission which shall be executed, where possible, by offsetting against amounts due to the Member State under subsequent payments to the same operational programme. Such recovery shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Fund to the operational programme. The amount recovered shall constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 177(3) of the Financial Regulation.\n8.   Where after applying the procedure set out in paragraph 4, the Commission is unable to accept the accounts, the Commission shall determine, on the basis of the available information and in accordance with paragraph 6, the amount chargeable to the Fund for the accounting year, and shall inform the Member State. Where the Member State notifies the Commission of its agreement within two months of the transmission by the Commission of the information, paragraph 7 shall apply. In the absence of such agreement, the Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out the amount chargeable to the Fund for the accounting year. Such decision shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Fund to the operational programme. On the basis of the decision, the Commission shall apply the adjustments to the payments to the Member State in accordance with paragraph 7.\n9.   The acceptance of the accounts by the Commission, or a decision by the Commission under paragraph 8, shall be without prejudice to the application of corrections under Articles 55 and 56.\n10.   Member States may replace irregular amounts which are detected after the submission of the accounts by making the corresponding adjustments in the accounts for the accounting year in which the irregularity is detected, without prejudice to Articles 55 and 56.\nArticle 51\nAvailability of documents\n1.   The managing authority shall ensure that all supporting documents regarding expenditure supported by the Fund on operations for which the total eligible public expenditure is less than EUR 1 000 000, are made available to the Commission and the European Court of Auditors upon request for a period of three years from 31 December following the submission of the accounts in which the expenditure of the operation is included.\nIn the case of operations other than those referred to in the first subparagraph, all supporting documents shall be made available for a two year period from 31 December following the submission of the accounts in which the final expenditure of the completed operation is included.\nA managing authority may decide to apply to operations for which the total eligible expenditure is less than EUR 1 000 000 the rule referred to in second subparagraph.\nThe time period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be interrupted either in the case of legal proceedings or by a duly justified request of the Commission.\n2.   The managing authority shall inform beneficiaries of the start date of the period referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   The documents shall be kept either in the form of the originals, or certified true copies of the originals, or on commonly accepted data carriers including electronic versions of original documents or documents existing in electronic version only.\n4.   The documents shall be kept in a form which permits the identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed.\n5.   The procedure for certification of conformity of documents held on commonly accepted data carriers with the original document shall be laid down by the national authorities and shall ensure that the versions held comply with national legal requirements and can be relied on for audit purposes.\n6.   Where documents exist in electronic form only, the computer systems used shall meet accepted security standards that ensure that the documents held comply with national legal requirements and can be relied on for audit purposes.\nArticle 52\nSubmission of closure documents and payment of the final balance\n1.   In addition to the documents referred to in Article 48, for the final accounting year from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, Member States shall submit a final implementation report for the operational programme.\n2.   The final balance shall be paid no later than three months after the date of acceptance of accounts of the final accounting year or one month after the date of acceptance of the final implementation report, whichever date is later.\nCHAPTER 3\nFinancial corrections and recoveries\nArticle 53\nFinancial corrections by Member States\n1.   The Member States shall in the first instance be responsible for investigating irregularities and for making the financial corrections required and pursuing recoveries. In the case of a systemic irregularity, the Member State shall extend its investigation to cover all operations potentially affected.\n2.   The Member States shall make the financial corrections required in connection with individual or systemic irregularities detected in operations or operational programmes. Financial corrections shall consist of cancelling all or part of the public contribution to an operation or operational programme. The Member State shall take into account the nature and gravity of the irregularities and the financial loss to the Fund and shall apply a proportionate correction. Financial corrections shall be recorded in the accounts by the managing authority for the accounting year in which the cancellation is decided.\n3.   The contribution from the Fund cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may be reused by the Member State within the operational programme concerned, subject to paragraph 4.\n4.   The contribution cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may not be reused for any operation that was the subject of the correction or, where a financial correction is made for a systemic irregularity, for any operation affected by the systemic irregularity.\n5.   A financial correction shall not prejudice the Member States' obligation to pursue recoveries under this Article.\nArticle 54\nFinancial corrections by the Commission\n1.   The Commission shall make financial corrections, by means of implementing acts, by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to an operational programme and effecting recovery from the Member State in order to exclude from Union financing expenditure which is in breach of applicable law.\n2.   A breach of applicable law shall lead to a financial correction only in relation to expenditure which has been declared to the Commission and where one of the following conditions is met:\n(a)\nthe breach has affected the selection of an operation by the body responsible for support from the Fund or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to establish that impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect;\n(b)\nthe breach has affected the amount of expenditure declared for reimbursement by the budget of the Union or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to quantify its financial impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect.\n3.   When deciding on a financial correction under paragraph 1, the Commission shall respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the breach of applicable law and its financial implications for the budget of the Union. The Commission shall keep the European Parliament and the Council informed of decisions taken to apply financial corrections.\nArticle 55\nCriteria for financial corrections by the Commission\n1.   The Commission shall make financial corrections by means of implementing acts by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to an operational programme in accordance with Article 54 where, after carrying out the necessary examination, it concludes that:\n(a)\nthere is a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme which has put at risk the Union contribution already paid to the operational programme;\n(b)\nthe Member State has not complied with its obligations under Article 53 prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph;\n(c)\nexpenditure contained in a payment application is irregular and has not been corrected by the Member State prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph.\nThe Commission shall base its financial corrections on individual cases of identified irregularity and shall take account of whether an irregularity is systemic. Where it is not possible to quantify precisely the amount of irregular expenditure charged to the Fund, the Commission shall apply a flat-rate or extrapolated financial correction.\n2.   The Commission shall, when deciding on a correction under paragraph 1, respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the irregularity and the extent and financial implications of the deficiencies in management and control systems found in the operational programme.\n3.   Where the Commission bases its position on reports of auditors other than those of its own services, it shall draw its own conclusions regarding the financial consequences after examining the measures taken by the Member State concerned under Article 53(2), the notifications sent under Article 30(2), and any replies from the Member State.\n4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 62, laying down detailed rules concerning the criteria for determining serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of management and control systems, including the main types of such deficiencies, the criteria for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied and the criteria for applying flat-rates or extrapolated financial corrections.\nArticle 56\nProcedure for financial corrections by the Commission\n1.   Before taking a decision on a financial correction, the Commission shall launch the procedure by informing the Member State of the provisional conclusions of its examination and requesting the Member State to submit its comments within two months.\n2.   Where the Commission proposes a financial correction on the basis of extrapolation or a flat-rate, the Member State shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate, through an examination of the documentation concerned, that the actual extent of irregularity is less than the Commission's assessment. In agreement with the Commission, the Member State may limit the scope of that examination to an appropriate proportion or sample of the documentation concerned. Except in duly justified cases, the time allowed for this examination shall not exceed a further period of two months after the two-month period referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   The Commission shall take account of any evidence provided by the Member State within the time limits set out in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.   Where the Member State does not accept the provisional conclusions of the Commission, the Member State shall be invited to a hearing by the Commission, in order to ensure that all relevant information and observations are available as a basis for conclusions by the Commission on the application of the financial correction.\n5.   In the event of an agreement, and without prejudice to paragraph 7 of this Article, the Member State may reuse the Fund in accordance with Article 53(3).\n6.   In order to apply financial corrections the Commission shall take a decision, by means of implementing acts, within six months of the date of the hearing, or of the date of receipt of additional information where the Member State agrees to submit such additional information following the hearing. The Commission shall take account of all information and observations submitted during the course of the procedure. If no hearing takes place, the six month period shall begin to run two months after the date of the letter of invitation to the hearing sent by the Commission.\n7.   Where the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under Article 36, or the European Court of Auditors, detects irregularities demonstrating a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control systems, the resulting financial correction shall reduce support from the Fund to the operational programme.\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of a management and control system which, prior to the date of detection by the Commission or the European Court of Auditors:\n(a)\nhad been identified in the management declaration, annual control report or the audit opinion submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation, or in other audit reports of the audit authority submitted to the Commission and appropriate measures taken; or\n(b)\nhad been the subject of appropriate remedial measures by the Member State.\nThe assessment of serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of a management and control system shall be based on the applicable law when the relevant management declarations, annual control reports and audit opinions were submitted.\nWhen deciding on a financial correction the Commission shall:\n(a)\nrespect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the serious deficiency in the effective functioning of a management and control system and its financial implications for the budget of the Union;\n(b)\nfor the purpose of applying a flat-rate or extrapolated correction, exclude irregular expenditure previously detected by the Member State which has been the subject of an adjustment in the accounts in accordance with Article 50(10), and expenditure subject to an ongoing assessment of its legality and regularity under Article 49(2);\n(c)\ntake into account flat-rate or extrapolated corrections applied to the expenditure by the Member State for other serious deficiencies detected by the Member State when determining the residual risk for the budget of the Union.\nArticle 57\nRepayment\n1.   Any repayment due to be made to the budget of the Union shall be effected before the due date indicated in the order for recovery drawn up in accordance with Article 73 of the Financial Regulation. The due date shall be the last day of the second month following the issuing of the order.\n2.   Any delay in effecting repayment shall give rise to interest on account of late payment, starting on the due date and ending on the date of actual payment. The rate of such interest shall be one-and-a-half percentage points above the rate applied by the European Central Bank in its main refinancing operations on the first working day of the month in which the due date falls.\nArticle 58\nProportional control of operational programmes\n1.   Operations for which the total eligible expenditure does not exceed EUR 150 000 shall not be subject to more than one audit by either the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Other operations shall not be subject to more than one audit per accounting year either by the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Operations shall not be subject to an audit by the Commission or the audit authority in any year if there has already been an audit in that year by the European Court of Auditors, provided that the results of the audit work performed by the European Court of Auditors for such operations can be used by the audit authority or the Commission for the purpose of fulfilling their respective tasks.\n2.   The audit of an operation supported by an OP I may cover all stages of its implementation and all levels of the distribution chain, with the sole exception of control of the end recipients, unless a risk assessment establishes a specific risk of irregularity or fraud.\n3.   For operational programmes for which the most recent audit opinion indicates that there are no significant deficiencies, the Commission may agree with the audit authority in the subsequent meeting referred to in Article 37(2) that the level of audit work required may be reduced so that it is proportionate to the risk established. In such cases, the Commission shall not carry out its own on-the-spot audits unless there is evidence suggesting deficiencies in the management and control system affecting expenditure declared to the Commission in an accounting year for which the accounts have been accepted by the Commission.\n4.   For operational programmes for which the Commission concludes that the opinion of the audit authority is reliable, it may agree with the audit authority to limit the Commission's own on-the-spot audits to audit the work of the audit authority unless there is evidence of deficiencies in the work of the audit authority work for an accounting year for which the accounts have been accepted by the Commission.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the audit authority and the Commission may carry out audits of operations in the event that a risk assessment or an audit by the European Court of Auditors establishes a specific risk of irregularity or fraud, in the case of evidence of serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme concerned, and, during the period referred to in Article 51(1). The Commission may, for the purpose of assessing the work of an audit authority, review the audit trail of the audit authority or take part in the on-the-spot audits of the audit authority and, where, in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards, it is necessary for the purpose of obtaining assurance as to the effective functioning of the audit authority, the Commission may carry out audits of operations.\nCHAPTER 4\nDecommitment\nArticle 59\nDecommitment\n1.   The Commission shall decommit any part of the amount in an operational programme that has not been used for payment of the pre-financing and interim payments by 31 December of the third financial year following the year of budget commitment under the operational programme or for which a payment application drawn up in accordance with Article 41 has not been submitted in accordance with Article 45, including any payment application for which all or part is subject to an interruption of the payment deadline or suspension of payments.\n2.   That part of commitments still open on 31 December 2023 shall be decommitted if any of the documents required under Article 52(1) has not been submitted to the Commission by the deadline set out in Article 52(1).\nArticle 60\nException to the decommitment\n1.   The amount concerned by decommitment shall be reduced by the amounts equivalent to that part of the budget commitment for which:\n(a)\nthe operations are suspended by a legal proceeding or by an administrative appeal having suspensory effect; or\n(b)\nit has not been possible to make a request for payment for reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of all or part of the operational programme.\nThe national authorities claiming force majeure under point (b) of the first subparagraph shall demonstrate the direct consequences of the force majeure on the implementation of all or part of the operational programme.\nFor the purpose of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph, the reduction may be requested once, if the suspension or force majeure lasted no longer than one year, or a number of times that corresponds to the duration of the force majeure or the number of years between the date of the legal or administrative decision suspending the implementation of the operation and the date of the final legal or administrative decision.\n2.   By 31 January, the Member State shall send to the Commission information on the exceptions referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 for the amount to be declared by the end of the preceding year.\nArticle 61\nProcedure\n1.   The Commission shall inform the Member State and the managing authority in good time whenever there is a risk of application of the decommitment rule under Article 59.\n2.   On the basis of the information it received as of 31 January, the Commission shall inform the Member State and the managing authority of the amount of the decommitment resulting from that information.\n3.   The Member State shall have two months to agree to the amount to be decommitted or to submit its observations.\n4.   By 30 June, the Member State shall submit to the Commission a revised financing plan reflecting, for the financial year concerned, the reduced amount of support of the operational programme. Failing such submission, the Commission shall revise the financing plan by reducing the contribution from the Fund for the financial year concerned.\n5.   The Commission shall amend the decision adopting the operational programme, by means of implementing acts, no later than 30 September.\nTITLE VII\nDELEGATIONS OF POWER, IMPLEMENTING AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 62\nExercise of the delegation\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.   The delegations of power referred to in Article 13(6), the fifth subparagraph of Article 30(2), the first subparagraph of Article 32(8), Article 32(9), Article 34(7), Article 34(8) and Article 55(4) shall be conferred for an indeterminate period of time from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n3.   As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n4.   The delegated acts shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council.\nIf, on expiry of that period, neither the European Parliament nor the Council has objected to the delegated act, it shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and shall enter into force at the date stated therein.\nThe delegated act may be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and enter into force before the expiry of that period if the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission of their intention not to raise objections.\nIf the European Parliament or the Council objects to a delegated act, the act shall not enter into force. The institution that objects to the delegated act shall state the reasons for its objections.\nArticle 63\nCommittee Procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n3.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\nWhere the committee delivers no opinion, the Commission shall not adopt the draft implementing act in respect of the implementing powers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 32(8) of this Regulation, and the third subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\nArticle 64\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

FEAD follows on from the EU food aid programme.\nIts specific aim is to help alleviate the most severe forms of poverty.\nIts main focus is to provide basic material assistance and/or food to the most deprived people, together with other related measures, or to provide dedicated social inclusion support.\nIn taking care of people’s most basic needs, it complements the European Social Fund, which can provide further social inclusion support with a view to integrating people into the labour market.\nKEY POINTS\nApproval of national programmes by the European Commission\nThe management of the fund is shared between the Commission and the EU Member States, in the same way as the European Structural and Investment Funds.\nNational authorities submit a national programme for the 2014-2020 period for the Commission’s approval. It contains all the information concerning, for example, what action(s) that Member State is proposing to take, the type of assistance planned and how that country is going to manage the programme.\nMember States can choose what type of assistance they will provide (food, basic goods or a combination, as well as social inclusion support — for example, activities to help the inclusion of elderly people or children) and how to procure and distribute these goods.\nPartner organisations at national level\nTo implement the programme on the ground, each Member State selects partner organisations — either public bodies or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — using objective and transparent criteria that are defined at national level.\nImplementation\nThe Commission has adopted implementing acts (see related documents below) which lay down rules for submitting, implementing and monitoring of programmes financed by the FEAD. These implementing acts mainly aim to: set out the conditions of the use of the System for Fund Management in the European Union (SFC2014). The SFC2014 is an electronic data-exchange system between the Member States and the Commission for the implementation of EU funds;create a computerised system to store data on the financial management and the evaluation of the programmes financed by FEAD;set up specific models for the management and the payment of each operational programme implemented under FEAD;set out the frequency and the format of the reporting of irregularities;set out models for the management declaration, the audit strategy, the audit opinion and the annual control report.\nThe Commission has also adopted delegated acts, among other things, introducing specific rules on the reporting of irregularities (Regulation (EU) 2015/1972) and laying down the content of the annual and final implementation reports, including the list of common indicators (Regulation (EU) No 1255/2014).\nBudget\nOver €3.8 billion is allocated for FEAD for 2014-2020 (in current prices).\nIn addition, Member States must contribute at least 15% in national co-financing to their national programme.\nRevision of the Financial Regulation (Omnibus Regulation): first amendment to the regulation\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 (see summary) amends Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 to simplify the implementation of the fund, notably by:\nextending the possibility for Member States to use simplified cost options;\nsimplifying the procedures for amending certain elements of operational programmes;\nsetting up safeguards for partner organisations in case the body purchasing the food or other basic goods fails to comply with the applicable law.\nCOVID-19 pandemic: second amendment to the regulation\nRegulation (EU) 2020/559 amends Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 to enable Member States to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and introduces measures to ensure that the most deprived people can continue to receive assistance under FEAD in a safe environment.\nIt gives Member States sufficient flexibility and liquidity to adjust their support schemes to the situation based on consultations with partner organisations, including by: providing more flexibility to Member States to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE) for partner organisations;allowing alternative schemes of delivery, such as through vouchers or cards in electronic or other form;allowing Member States to amend certain elements of the operational programme without the need for a Commission decision;allowing expenditure in relation to operations providing a response to the COVID-19 outbreak to be eligible as from 1 February 2020 and by alleviating certain requirements on monitoring, control and audit.\nCOVID-19 pandemic: third amendment to the regulation\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2021/177 allows Member States to use additional funds made available for post-COVID-19 recovery under the REACT-EU initiative in 2021 and 2022.\nTo ensure Member States have sufficient financial means to swiftly implement measures to assist the most deprived, they may benefit from a co-financing rate of up to 100%. This alleviates the burden on Member States’ public budgets and provides some relief to organisations responding to the COVID-19 emergency in enabling the continuity of their aid provision.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2014.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 2012, according to Eurostat, close to 125 million people — almost a quarter of the EU’s population — were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Almost 50 million were suffering severe material deprivation.\nFor more information, see: Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 223/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2014 on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (OJ L 72, 12.3.2014, pp. 1-41)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 have been incorporated into the original text.
