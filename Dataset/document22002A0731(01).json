The objective of risk assessment, under this Protocol, is to identify and evaluate the potential adverse effects of living modified organisms on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in the likely potential receiving environment, taking also into account risks to human health.Use of risk assessment2. Risk assessment is, inter alia, used by competent authorities to make informed decisions regarding living modified organisms.General principles3. Risk assessment should be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner, and can take into account expert advice of, and guidelines developed by, relevant international organizations.4. Lack of scientific knowledge or scientific consensus should not necessarily be interpreted as indicating a particular level of risk, an absence of risk, or an acceptable risk.5. Risks associated with living modified organisms or products thereof, namely, processed materials that are of living modified organism origin, containing detectable novel combinations of replicable genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology, should be considered in the context of the risks posed by the non-modified recipients or parental organisms in the likely potential receiving environment.6. Risk assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis. The required information may vary in nature and level of detail from case to case, depending on the living modified organism concerned, its intended use and the likely potential receiving environment.Methodology7. The process of risk assessment may on the one hand give rise to a need for further information about specific subjects, which may be identified and requested during the assessment process, while on the other hand information on other subjects may not be relevant in some instances.8. To fulfil its objective, risk assessment entails, as appropriate, the following steps:(a) an identification of any novel genotypic and phenotypic characteristics associated with the living modified organism that may have adverse effects on biological diversity in the likely potential receiving environment, taking also into account risks to human health;(b) an evaluation of the likelihood of these adverse effects being realized, taking into account the level and kind of exposure of the likely potential receiving environment to the living modified organism;(c) an evaluation of the consequences should these adverse effects be realized;(d) an estimation of the overall risk posed by the living modified organism based on the evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of the identified adverse effects being realized;(e) a recommendation as to whether or not the risks are acceptable or manageable, including, where necessary, identification of strategies to manage these risks; and(f) where there is uncertainty regarding the level of risk, it may be addressed by requesting further information on the specific issues of concern or by implementing appropriate risk management strategies and/or monitoring the living modified organism in the receiving environment.Points to consider9. Depending on the case, risk assessment takes into account the relevant technical and scientific details regarding the characteristics of the following subjects:(a) Recipient organism or parental organisms. The biological characteristics of the recipient organism or parental organisms, including information on taxonomic status, common name, origin, centres of origin and centres of genetic diversity, if known, and a description of the habitat where the organisms may persist or proliferate;(b) Donor organism or organisms. Taxonomic status and common name, source, and the relevant biological characteristics of the donor organisms;(c) Vector. Characteristics of the vector, including its identity, if any, and its source or origin, and its host range;(d) Insert or inserts and/or characteristics of modification. Genetic characteristics of the inserted nucleic acid and the function it specifies, and/or characteristics of the modification introduced;(e) Living modified organism. Identity of the living modified organism, and the differences between the biological characteristics of the living modified organism and those of the recipient organism or parental organisms;(f) Detection and identification of the living modified organism. Suggested detection and identification methods and their specificity, sensitivity and reliability;(g) Information relating to the intended use. Information relating to the intended use of the living modified organism, including new or changed use compared to the recipient organism or parental organisms; and(h) Receiving environment. Information on the location, geographical, climatic and ecological characteristics, including relevant information on biological diversity and centres of origin of the likely potential receiving environment.ANNEX BDECLARATION BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 34(3) OF THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITYThe European Community declares that, in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, it is competent for entering into international agreements, and for implementing the obligations resulting therefrom, which contribute to the pursuit of the following objectives:- preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment,- protecting human health,- prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources,- promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems.Moreover, the European Community declares that it has already adopted legal instruments, binding on its Member States, covering matters governed by this Protocol, and will submit and update, as appropriate, a list of those legal instruments to the Biosafety Clearing House in accordance with Article 20(3)(a) of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.The European Community is responsible for the performance of those obligations resulting from the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety which are covered by Community law in force.The exercise of Community competence is, by its nature, subject to continuous development.", "summary": "Convention on Biological Diversity — Cartagena protocol on biosafety\nConvention on Biological Diversity — Cartagena protocol on biosafety\nSUMMARY OF:\nCartagena protocol on biosafety to the convention on biological diversity\nDecision 2002/628/EC on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety\nWHAT ARE THE AIMS OF THE PROTOCOL AND THE DECISION?\nThe Cartagena protocol to the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity (see summary) is based on the precautionary principle*. It aims to prevent any harm to biological diversity when living modified organisms* are transferred, handled or used, especially across borders (Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 — see summary). It takes into account risks to human health.\nThe Council decision gives the EU’s legal approval to the protocol.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nEach signatory to the protocol:\nadopts the necessary and appropriate legal, administrative and other measures to implement their commitments;\nensures that the development, handling, transport, use, transfer and release of any living modified organisms prevents or reduces the risk to biodiversity;\nmay take additional measures to protect the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity;\nis encouraged to take account of the work and expertise of international bodies specialising in risks to human health;\nmay participate in bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements and arrangements, including with non-signatory countries, providing these do not lower levels of protection;\nmust apply appropriate mechanisms, measures and strategies to control identified risks;\ncooperates to identify living modified organisms that could have harmful effects;\ncooperates to develop human and institutional resources to protect biosafety* and raise public awareness;\nmust notify affected or potentially affected countries, the Biosafety Clearing-House and, if necessary, relevant international organisations of any incident in its jurisdiction which could cause cross-border harm;\nensures the safe handling, packaging, identification and transportation of exported living modified organisms, along with the necessary documentation;\nprovides the Biosafety Clearing-House with details of its national laws, risk assessments, decisions and other information the protocol requires;\nimplements appropriate domestic measures to prevent and penalise illegal trade in living modified organisms;\nmay withdraw from the protocol 1 year after giving written notification.\nThe protocol applies to all international movement, transit, handling or use of living modified organisms that could harm biological diversity and human health, except for human medicines covered by other international agreements or organisations.\nAn advanced informed agreement procedure applies to the first export of living modified organisms to be deliberately introduced into the environment, except for those already identified as not harmful to biodiversity or human health. This requires:\nthe exporting country to notify in writing beforehand the relevant importing authorities with specific details (set out in Annex I) of the shipment;\nthe importing authorities must acknowledge receipt of the notification within 90 days and decide whether the import may go ahead. They may: approve the import, with or without conditions,refuse the import,request additional information,decide more time is required to process the notification,change an earlier decision in the light of new scientific information,apply a simplified procedure in certain circumstances,allow certain information submitted by the notifier to remain confidential. This does not apply to a general description of the item, a summary of the risk assessment or measures to tackle an emergency.\nA specific procedure applies to living modified organisms for direct use as food, feed or processing. A country which decides that an item may be used or sold on its domestic market, which might then also be exported, must provide detailed information (set out in Annex II) to other signatories through the Biosafety Clearing House.\nThe protocol provides for risk assessments based on scientifically sound methodologies (Annex III).\nA national focal point in each country liaises with the secretariat established by the convention. Specified national authorities carry out the administrative tasks the protocol requires.\nA Biosafety Clearing House is established to:\nhandle the exchange of scientific, technical, environmental and regulatory information;\nhelp signatories, particularly those most in need, to implement the protocol;\nThe conference of the parties, involving all the convention’s signatories, reviews the protocol, assesses it every 5 years, recommends measures to be taken and sets up subsidiary bodies.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.\nBACKGROUND\nThe United Nations Environment Programme’s Convention on Biological Diversity took effect on 29 December 1993.\nThe Cartagena protocol to the convention on biosafety was adopted in Montreal on 29 January 2000.\nIn 2013, by Decision 2013/86/EU, the Council concluded on behalf of the EU the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.\nFor more information, see: Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPrecautionary principle: where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation (Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development).\nLiving modified organism: any living organism with a novel combination of genetic material created by modern biotechnology.\nBiosafety: the protection of human health and the environment from the possible adverse effects of the products of modern biotechnology.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCartagena protocol on biosafety to the convention on biological diversity (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, pp. 50-65)\nCouncil Decision 2002/628/EC of 25 June 2002 concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, pp. 48-49)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nNagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (OJ L 46, 19.2.2013, pp. 4-7)\nCouncil Decision 2013/86/EU of 12 February 2013 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (OJ L 46, 19.2.2013, pp. 1-3)\nRegulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (OJ L 287, 5.11.2003, pp. 1-10)\nConvention on biological diversity (OJ L 309, 13.12.1993, pp. 3-20)\nCouncil Decision 93/626/EEC of 25 October 1993 concerning the conclusion of the Convention on Biological Diversity (OJ L 309, 13.12.1993, pp. 1-2)\nlast update 17.11.2020", "tags": ["health control", "UN convention", "common commercial policy", "environmental protection", "protocol to an agreement", "public safety", "environmental risk prevention", "biodiversity", "genetically modified organism"], "subjects": ["Environment", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
