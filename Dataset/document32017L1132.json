In the interests of clarity and rationality those Directives should be codified.\n(2)\nThe coordination provided for in Article 50(2)(g) of the Treaty and in the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment, which was begun by the First Council Directive 68/151/EEC (10), is especially important in relation to public limited liability companies because their activities predominate in the economy of the Member States and frequently extend beyond their national boundaries.\n(3)\nIn order to ensure minimum equivalent protection for both shareholders and creditors of public limited liability companies, the coordination of national provisions relating to the formation of such companies and to the maintenance, increase or reduction of their capital is particularly important.\n(4)\nIn the Union, the statutes or instrument of incorporation of a public limited liability company must make it possible for any interested person to acquaint oneself with the basic particulars of the company, including the exact composition of its capital.\n(5)\nThe protection of third parties should be ensured by provisions which restrict to the greatest possible extent the grounds on which obligations entered into in the name of companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability are not valid.\n(6)\nIt is necessary, in order to ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between companies and third parties, and also between members, to limit the cases in which nullity can arise and the retroactive effect of a declaration of nullity, and to fix a short time limit within which third parties may enter an objection to any such declaration.\n(7)\nThe coordination of national provisions concerning disclosure, the validity of obligations entered into by, and the nullity of, companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability, is of special importance, particularly for the purpose of protecting the interests of third parties.\n(8)\nThe basic documents of a company should be disclosed in order for third parties to be able to ascertain their contents and other information concerning the company, especially particulars of the persons who are authorised to bind the company.\n(9)\nWithout prejudice to substantive requirements and formalities established by the national law of the Member States, companies should be able to choose to file their compulsory documents and particulars by paper means or by electronic means.\n(10)\nInterested parties should be able to obtain from the register a copy of such documents and particulars by paper means as well as by electronic means.\n(11)\nMember States should be allowed to decide to keep the national gazette, designated for publication of compulsory documents and particulars, in paper form or electronic form, or to provide for disclosure by equally effective means.\n(12)\nCross-border access to company information should be facilitated by allowing, in addition to the compulsory disclosure made in one of the languages permitted in the company's Member State, the voluntary registration in additional languages of the required documents and particulars. Third parties acting in good faith should be able to rely on the translations thereof.\n(13)\nIt is appropriate to clarify that the statement of the compulsory particulars set out in this Directive should be included in all company letters and order forms, whether they are in paper form or use any other medium. In the light of technological developments, it is also appropriate to provide that that statement of compulsory particulars be placed on any company website.\n(14)\nThe opening of a branch, like the creation of a subsidiary, is one of the possibilities currently open to companies in the exercise of their right of establishment in another Member State.\n(15)\nIn respect of branches, the lack of coordination, in particular concerning disclosure, gives rise to some disparities, in the protection of shareholders and third parties, between companies which operate in other Member States by opening branches and those which operate there by creating subsidiaries.\n(16)\nTo ensure the protection of persons who deal with companies through the intermediary of branches, measures in respect of disclosure are required in the Member State in which a branch is situated. In certain respects, the economic and social influence of a branch can be comparable to that of a subsidiary company, so that there is public interest in disclosure of the company at the branch. To effect such disclosure, it is necessary to make use of the procedure already instituted for companies with share capital within the Union.\n(17)\nSuch disclosure relates to a range of important documents and particulars and amendments thereto.\n(18)\nSuch disclosure, with the exception of the powers of representation, the name and legal form, and the winding-up of the company and the insolvency proceedings to which it is subject, can be confined to information concerning a branch itself together with a reference to the register of the company of which that branch is part, since under existing Union rules, all information covering the company as such is available in that register.\n(19)\nNational provisions in respect of the disclosure of accounting documents relating to a branch can no longer be justified following the coordination of national law in respect of the drawing up, audit and disclosure of companies' accounting documents. It is accordingly sufficient to disclose, in the register of the branch, the accounting documents as audited and disclosed by the company.\n(20)\nLetters and order forms used by a branch should give at least the same information as letters and order forms used by the company, and state the register in which the branch is entered.\n(21)\nTo ensure that the purposes of this Directive are fully realised and to avoid any discrimination on the basis of a company's country of origin, this Directive should also cover branches opened by companies governed by the law of third countries and set up in legal forms comparable to companies to which this Directive applies. For such branches it is necessary to apply specific provisions that are different from those that apply to the branches of companies governed by the law of other Member States since this Directive does not apply to companies from third countries.\n(22)\nThis Directive in no way affects the disclosure requirements for branches under other provisions of, for example, employment law on workers' rights to information and tax law, or for statistical purposes.\n(23)\nThe interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers is a measure required to create a more business-friendly legal and fiscal environment. It should contribute to fostering the competitiveness of European business by reducing administrative burdens and increasing legal certainty and thus contributing to an exit from the global economic and financial crisis, which is one of the priorities of the agenda of Europe 2020. It should also improve cross-border communication between registers by using innovations in information and communication technology.\n(24)\nThe Multiannual European e-Justice action plan 2009–2013 (11) provided for the development of a European e-Justice portal (‘the portal’) as the single European electronic access point for legal information, judicial and administrative institutions, registers, databases and other services and considers the interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers to be important.\n(25)\nCross-border access to business information on companies and their branches opened in other Member States can only be improved if all Member States engage in enabling electronic communication to take place between registers and transmitting information to individual users in a standardised way, by means of identical content and interoperable technologies, throughout the Union. This interoperability of registers should be ensured by the registers of Member States (‘domestic registers’) providing services, which should constitute interfaces with the European central platform (‘the platform’). The platform should be a centralised set of information technology tools integrating services and should form a common interface. That interface should be used by all domestic registers. The platform should also provide services constituting an interface with the portal serving as the European electronic access point, and to the optional access points established by Member States. The platform should be conceived only as an instrument for the interconnection of registers and not as a distinct entity possessing legal personality. On the basis of unique identifiers, the platform should be capable of distributing information from each of the Member States' registers to the competent registers of other Member States in a standard message format (an electronic form of messages exchanged between information technology systems, such as, for example, xml) and in the relevant language version.\n(26)\nThis Directive is not aimed at establishing any centralised registers database storing substantive information about companies. At the stage of implementation of the system of interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers (‘the system of interconnection of registers’), only the set of data necessary for the correct functioning of the platform should be defined. The scope of those data should include, in particular, operational data, dictionaries and glossaries. It should be determined taking also into account the need to ensure the efficient operation of the system of interconnection of registers. Those data should be used for the purpose of enabling the platform to perform its functions and should never be made publicly available in a direct form. Moreover, the platform should modify neither the content of the data on companies stored in domestic registers nor the information about companies transmitted through the system of interconnection of registers.\n(27)\nSince the objective of Directive 2012/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) was not to harmonise national systems of central, commercial and companies registers, that Directive did not impose any obligation on Member States to change their internal systems of registers, in particular as regards the management and storage of data, fees, and the use and disclosure of information for national purposes.\n(28)\nThe portal should deal, through the use of the platform, with queries submitted by individual users concerning the information on companies and their branches opened in other Member States which is stored in the domestic registers. That should enable the search results to be presented on the portal, including the explanatory labels in all the official languages of the Union, listing the information provided. In addition, in order to improve the protection of third parties in other Member States, basic information on the legal value of documents and particulars disclosed pursuant to the laws of Member States adopted in accordance with this Directive should be available on the portal.\n(29)\nMember States should be able to establish one or more optional access points, which may have an impact on the use and operation of the platform. Therefore, the Commission should be notified of their establishment and of any significant changes to their operation, in particular of their closure. Such notification should not in any way restrict the powers of Member States as to the establishment and operation of the optional access points.\n(30)\nCompanies and their branches opened in other Member States should have a unique identifier allowing them to be unequivocally identified within the Union. The identifier is intended to be used for communication between registers through the system of interconnection of registers. Therefore, companies and branches should not be obliged to include the unique identifier in the company letters or order forms mentioned in this Directive. They should continue to use their domestic registration number for their own communication purposes.\n(31)\nIt should be made possible to establish a clear connection between the register of a company and the registers of its branches opened in other Member States, consisting of the exchange of information on the opening and termination of any winding-up or insolvency proceedings of the company and on the striking-off of the company from the register, if this entails legal consequences in the Member State of the register of the company. While Member States should be able to decide on the procedures they follow with respect to the branches registered in their territory, they should ensure, at least, that the branches of a dissolved company are struck off the register without undue delay and, if applicable, after liquidation proceedings of the branch concerned. This obligation should not apply to branches of companies that have been struck off the register but which have a legal successor, such as in the case of any change in the legal form of the company, a merger or division, or a cross-border transfer of its registered office.\n(32)\nThe provisions of this Directive relating to the interconnection of registers should not apply to a branch opened in a Member State by a company which is not governed by the law of a Member State.\n(33)\nMember States should ensure that, in the event of any changes to information entered in the registers concerning companies, the information is updated without undue delay. The update should be disclosed, normally, within 21 days of receipt of the complete documentation regarding those changes, including the legality check in accordance with national law. That time limit should be interpreted as requiring Member States to make reasonable efforts to meet the deadline laid down in this Directive. It should not be applicable as regards the accounting documents which companies are obliged to submit for each financial year. That exclusion is justified by the overload of work on domestic registers during reporting periods. In accordance with general legal principles common to all Member States, the time limit of 21 days should be suspended in cases of force majeure.\n(34)\nIf the Commission decides to develop and/or operate the platform through a third party, this should be done in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). An appropriate degree of Member States' involvement in this process should be ensured by establishing the technical specifications for the purpose of the public procurement procedure by means of implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).\n(35)\nIf the Commission decides to operate the platform through a third party, the continuity of the provision of services by the system of interconnection of registers and a proper public supervision of the functioning of the platform should be ensured. Detailed rules on the operational management of the platform should be adopted by means of implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In any case, the involvement of Member States in the functioning of the whole system should be ensured by means of a regular dialogue between the Commission and the representatives of Member States on the issues concerning the operation of the system of interconnection of registers and its future development.\n(36)\nThe interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers necessitates the coordination of national systems having varying technical characteristics. This entails the adoption of technical measures and specifications which need to take account of differences between registers. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to tackle those technical and operational issues. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(37)\nThis Directive should not limit the right of Member States to charge fees for obtaining information on companies through the system of interconnection of registers, if such fees are required under national law. Therefore, technical measures and specifications for the system of interconnection of registers should allow for the establishment of payment modalities. In this respect, this Directive should not prejudge any specific technical solution as the payment modalities should be determined at the stage of adoption of the implementing acts, taking into account widely available online payment facilities.\n(38)\nIt could be desirable for third countries to be able, in the future, to participate in the system of interconnection of registers.\n(39)\nAn equitable solution regarding the funding of the system of interconnection of registers entails participation both by the Union and by its Member States in the financing of that system. Member States should bear the financial burden of adjusting their domestic registers to that system, while the central elements, namely the platform and the portal serving as the European electronic access point, should be funded from an appropriate budget line in the general budget of the Union. In order to supplement non-essential elements of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the charging of fees for obtaining company information. This does not affect the possibility for the domestic registers to charge fees, but it could involve an additional fee in order to co-finance the maintenance and functioning of the platform. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(40)\nUnion provisions are necessary for maintaining the capital, which constitutes the creditors' security, in particular by prohibiting any reduction thereof by distribution to shareholders where the latter are not entitled to it and by imposing limits on the right of public limited liability companies to acquire their own shares.\n(41)\nThe restrictions on a public limited liability company's acquisition of its own shares apply not only to acquisitions made by a company itself but also to those made by any person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf.\n(42)\nIn order to prevent a public limited liability company from using another company in which it holds a majority of the voting rights or on which it can exercise a dominant influence to make such acquisitions without complying with the restrictions imposed in that respect, the arrangements governing a company's acquisition of its own shares should cover the most important and most frequent cases of the acquisition of shares by such other companies. Those arrangements should cover subscription for shares in the public limited liability company.\n(43)\nIn order to prevent the circumvention of this Directive, companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability governed by this Directive and companies governed by the laws of third countries, and having comparable legal forms, should also be covered by the arrangements referred to in recital 42.\n(44)\nWhere the relationship between a public limited liability company and another company such as referred to in recital 42 is only indirect, it would appear to be justified to relax the provisions applicable when that relationship is direct, by providing for the suspension of voting rights as a minimum measure, for the purpose of achieving the aims of this Directive.\n(45)\nFurthermore, it is justifiable to exempt cases in which the specific nature of a professional activity rules out the possibility of the attainment of the objectives of this Directive being endangered.\n(46)\nIt is necessary, having regard to the objectives of Article 50(2)(g) of the Treaty, that the Member States' laws relating to the increase or reduction of capital ensure that the principles of equal treatment of shareholders in the same position and of protection of creditors whose claims exist prior to the decision on reduction are observed and harmonised.\n(47)\nIn order to enhance standardised creditor protection in all Member States, creditors should be able to resort, under certain conditions, to judicial or administrative proceedings where their claims are at stake, as a consequence of a reduction in the capital of a public limited liability company.\n(48)\nIn order to ensure that market abuse is prevented, Member States should take into account, for the purpose of the implementation of this Directive, the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15).\n(49)\nThe protection of the interests of members and third parties requires that the laws of the Member States relating to mergers of public limited liability companies be coordinated, and that provision for mergers be made in the laws of all the Member States.\n(50)\nIn the context of such coordination, it is particularly important that the shareholders of merging companies be kept adequately informed in as objective a manner as possible, and that their rights be suitably protected. However, there is no reason to require an examination of the draft terms of a merger by an independent expert for the shareholders if all the shareholders agree that it can be dispensed with.\n(51)\nCreditors, including debenture holders, and persons having other claims on the merging companies should be protected so that the merger does not adversely affect their interests.\n(52)\nThe disclosure requirements for the protection of the interests of members and third parties should include mergers so that third parties are kept adequately informed.\n(53)\nThe safeguards afforded to members and third parties in connection with mergers of public limited liability companies should cover certain legal practices which in important respects are similar to merger, so that the obligation to provide such protection cannot be evaded.\n(54)\nTo ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between the companies concerned, between them and third parties, and between the members, it is necessary to limit the cases in which nullity can arise by providing that defects be remedied wherever that is possible, and by restricting the period within which nullification proceedings can be commenced.\n(55)\nThis Directive also facilitates the cross-border merger of limited liability companies. The laws of the Member States should allow the cross-border merger of a national limited liability company with a limited liability company from another Member State if the national law of the relevant Member States permits mergers between such types of company.\n(56)\nIn order to facilitate cross-border merger operations, it should be specified that, unless this Directive provides otherwise, each company taking part in a cross-border merger, and each third party concerned, remains subject to the provisions and formalities of the national law which would be applicable in the case of a national merger. None of the provisions and formalities of national law, to which reference is made in this Directive, should introduce restrictions on freedom of establishment or on the free movement of capital, save where these can be justified in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and in particular, by requirements of the general interest and are both necessary for, and proportionate to, the attainment of such overriding requirements.\n(57)\nThe common draft terms of a cross-border merger should be drawn up in the same terms for each of the companies concerned in the various Member States. The minimum content of such common draft terms should therefore be specified, while leaving the companies free to agree on other terms.\n(58)\nIn order to protect the interests of members and others, both the common draft terms of the cross-border merger and the completion of the cross-border merger should be publicised for each merging company via an entry in the appropriate public register.\n(59)\nThe laws of all the Member States should provide for the drawing-up at national level of a report on the common draft terms of the cross-border merger by one or more experts on behalf of each of the companies that are merging. In order to limit experts' costs connected with cross-border mergers, provision should be made for the possibility of drawing up a single report intended for all members of companies taking part in a cross-border merger operation. The common draft terms of the cross-border merger should be approved by the general meeting of each of those companies.\n(60)\nIn order to facilitate cross-border merger operations, it should be provided that monitoring of the completion and legality of the decision-making process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies, whereas monitoring of the completion and legality of the cross-border merger should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over the company resulting from the cross-border merger. The national authority in question could be a court, a notary or any other competent authority appointed by the Member State concerned. The national law determining the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect, this being the law to which the company resulting from the cross-border merger is subject, should also be specified.\n(61)\nIn order to protect the interests of members and others, the legal effects of the cross-border merger, distinguishing as to whether the company resulting from the cross-border merger is an acquiring company or a new company, should be specified. In the interests of legal certainty, it should no longer be possible, after the date on which a cross-border merger takes effect, to declare the merger null and void.\n(62)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the application of the legislation on the control of concentrations between undertakings, both at Union level, by Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (16), and at Member State level.\n(63)\nThis Directive does not affect Union legislation regulating credit intermediaries and other financial undertakings and national rules made or introduced pursuant to such Union legislation.\n(64)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to Member State legislation demanding information on the place of central administration or the principal place of business proposed for the company resulting from the cross-border merger.\n(65)\nEmployees' rights, other than rights of participation, should remain subject to the national provisions referred to in Council Directives 98/59/EC (17) and 2001/23/EC (18), and in Directives 2002/14/EC (19) and 2009/38/EC (20) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n(66)\nIf employees have participation rights in one of the merging companies under the circumstances set out in this Directive and, if the national law of the Member State in which the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office does not provide for the same level of participation as operated in the relevant merging companies, including in committees of the supervisory board that have decision-making powers, or does not provide for the same entitlement to exercise rights for employees of establishments resulting from the cross-border merger, the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger and their involvement in the definition of such rights should be regulated. To that end, the principles and procedures provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 (21) and in Council Directive 2001/86/EC (22), should be taken as a basis, subject, however, to modifications that are deemed necessary because the resulting company will be subject to the national laws of the Member State where it has its registered office. A prompt start to negotiations under Article 133 of this Directive, with a view to not unnecessarily delaying mergers, may be ensured by Member States in accordance with Article 3(2)(b) of Directive 2001/86/EC.\n(67)\nFor the purpose of determining the level of employee participation operated in the relevant merging companies, account should also be taken of the proportion of employee representatives amongst the members of the management group, which covers the profit units of the companies, subject to employee participation.\n(68)\nThe protection of the interests of members and third parties requires that the laws of the Member States relating to divisions of public limited liability companies be coordinated where Member States permit such operations.\n(69)\nIn the context of such coordination, it is particularly important that the shareholders of the companies involved in a division be kept adequately informed in as objective a manner as possible, and that their rights be suitably protected.\n(70)\nCreditors, including debenture holders, and persons having other claims on the companies involved in a division of public limited liability companies, should be protected so that the division does not adversely affect their interests.\n(71)\nDisclosure requirements under Section 1 of Chapter III of Title I of this Directive should include divisions so that third parties are kept adequately informed.\n(72)\nThe safeguards afforded to members and third parties in connection with divisions should cover certain legal practices which in important respects are similar to division, so that the obligation to provide such protection cannot be evaded.\n(73)\nTo ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between the public limited liability companies involved in the division, between them and third parties, and between the members, the cases in which nullity can arise should be limited by providing that defects should be remedied wherever that is possible and by restricting the period within which nullification proceedings can be commenced.\n(74)\nCompany websites or other websites offer, in certain cases, an alternative to publication via the companies registers. Member States should be able to designate those other websites which companies can use free of charge for such publication, such as websites of business associations or chambers of commerce or the central electronic platform referred to in this Directive. Where the possibility exists of using company or other websites for publication of draft terms of merger and/or division and of other documents that have to be made available to shareholders and creditors in the process, guarantees relating to the security of the website and the authenticity of the documents should be met.\n(75)\nMember States should be able to provide that the extensive reporting or information requirements relating to the merger or division of companies, laid down in Chapter I and Chapter III of Title II, need not be complied with where all the shareholders of the companies involved in the merger or division agree that such compliance can be dispensed with.\n(76)\nAny modification of Chapter I and Chapter III of Title II allowing such agreement by shareholders, should be without prejudice to the systems of protection of the interests of creditors of the companies involved, and to rules aimed at ensuring the provision of necessary information to the employees of those companies and to public authorities, such as tax authorities, controlling the merger or division in accordance with existing Union law.\n(77)\nIt is not necessary to impose the requirement to draw up an accounting statement where an issuer whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market publishes half-yearly financial reports in accordance with Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (23).\n(78)\nAn independent expert's report on consideration other than in cash is often not needed where an independent expert's report protecting the interests of shareholders or creditors also has to be drawn up in the context of the merger or the division. Member States should therefore have the possibility in such cases of dispensing companies from the reporting requirement regarding consideration other than in cash or of providing that both reports can be drawn up by the same expert.\n(79)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (24) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25) govern the processing of personal data, including the electronic transmission of personal data within the Member States. Any processing of personal data by the registers of Member States, by the Commission and, if applicable, by any third party involved in operating the platform should take place in compliance with those acts. The implementing acts to be adopted in relation to the system of interconnection of registers should, where appropriate, ensure such compliance, in particular by establishing the relevant tasks and responsibilities of all the participants concerned and the organisational and technical rules applicable to them.\n(80)\nThis Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article 8 thereof, which states that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n(81)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for the transposition into national law and the dates of application of the directives set out in Annex III, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNCTIONING OF LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES\nCHAPTER I\nSubject matter\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down measures concerning the following:\n—\nthe coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent,\n—\nthe coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty, in respect of disclosure, the validity of obligations entered into by, and the nullity of, companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent,\n—\nthe disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State,\n—\nmergers of public limited liability companies,\n—\ncross-border mergers of limited liability companies,\n—\nthe division of public limited liability companies.\nCHAPTER II\nIncorporation and nulity of the company and validity of its obligations\nSection 1\nIncorporation of the public liability company\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Member States may decide not to apply this Section to investment companies with variable capital and to cooperatives incorporated as one of the types of company listed in Annex I. In so far as the laws of the Member States make use of this option, they shall require such companies to include the words ‘investment company with variable capital’, or ‘cooperative’ in all documents indicated in Article 26.\nThe term ‘investment company with variable capital’, within the meaning of this Directive, means only those companies:\n—\nthe exclusive object of which is to invest their funds in various stocks and shares, land or other assets with the sole aim of spreading investment risks and giving their shareholders the benefit of the results of the management of their assets,\n—\nwhich offer their own shares for subscription by the public, and\n—\nthe statutes of which provide that, within the limits of a minimum and maximum capital, they may at any time issue, redeem or resell their shares.\nArticle 3\nCompulsory information to be provided in the statutes or instruments of incorporation\nThe statutes or the instrument of incorporation of a company shall always give at least the following information:\n(a)\nthe type and name of the company;\n(b)\nthe objects of the company;\n(c)\nwhere the company has no authorised capital, the amount of the subscribed capital;\n(d)\nwhere the company has an authorised capital, the amount thereof and also the amount of the capital subscribed at the time the company is incorporated or is authorised to commence business, and at the time of any change in the authorised capital, without prejudice to Article 14(e);\n(e)\nin so far as they are not legally determined, the rules governing the number of, and the procedure for, appointing members of the bodies responsible for representing the company vis-à-vis third parties, administration, management, supervision or control of the company and the allocation of powers among those bodies;\n(f)\nthe duration of the company, except where this is indefinite.\nArticle 4\nCompulsory information to be provided in the statutes or instruments of incorporation or separate documents\nThe following information at least shall appear in either the statutes or the instrument of incorporation or a separate document published in accordance with the procedure laid down in the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 16:\n(a)\nthe registered office;\n(b)\nthe nominal value of the shares subscribed and, at least once a year, the number thereof;\n(c)\nthe number of shares subscribed without stating the nominal value, where such shares may be issued under national law;\n(d)\nthe special conditions, if any, limiting the transfer of shares;\n(e)\nwhere there are several classes of shares, the information referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) for each class and the rights attaching to the shares of each class;\n(f)\nwhether the shares are registered or bearer, where national law provides for both types, and any provisions relating to the conversion of such shares unless the procedure is laid down by law;\n(g)\nthe amount of the subscribed capital paid up at the time the company is incorporated or is authorised to commence business;\n(h)\nthe nominal value of the shares or, where there is no nominal value, the number of shares issued for a consideration other than in cash, together with the nature of the consideration and the name of the person providing the consideration;\n(i)\nthe identity of the natural or legal persons or companies or firms by which or in whose name the statutes or the instrument of incorporation, or where the company was not formed at the same time, the drafts of those documents, have been signed;\n(j)\nthe total amount, or at least an estimate, of all the costs payable by the company or chargeable to it by reason of its formation and, where appropriate, before the company is authorised to commence business;\n(k)\nany special advantage granted, at the time the company is formed or up to the time it receives authorisation to commence business, to anyone who has taken part in the formation of the company or in transactions leading to the grant of such authorisation.\nArticle 5\nAuthorisation for commencing business\n1.   Where the laws of a Member State prescribe that a company may not commence business without authorisation, they shall also make provision for responsibility for liabilities incurred by or on behalf of the company during the period before such authorisation is granted or refused.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to liabilities under contracts concluded by the company conditionally upon its being granted authorisation to commence business.\nArticle 6\nMultiple-member companies\n1.   Where the laws of a Member State require a company to be formed by more than one member, the fact that all the shares are held by one person or that the number of members has fallen below the legal minimum after incorporation of the company shall not lead to the automatic dissolution of the company.\n2.   If, in the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the laws of a Member State permit the company to be wound up by order of the court, the judge having jurisdiction shall be able to give the company sufficient time to regularise its position.\n3.

Acts done by the organs of the company shall be binding upon it even if those acts are not within the objects of the company, unless such acts exceed the powers that the law confers or allows to be conferred on those organs.\nHowever, Member States may provide that the company shall not be bound where such acts are outside the objects of the company, if it proves that the third party knew that the act was outside those objects or could not in view of the circumstances have been unaware of it. Disclosure of the statutes shall not of itself be sufficient proof thereof.\n2.   The limits on the powers of the organs of the company, arising under the statutes or from a decision of the competent organs, may not be relied on as against third parties, even if they have been disclosed.\n3.   If national law provides that authority to represent a company may, in derogation from the legal rules governing the subject, be conferred by the statutes on a single person or on several persons acting jointly, that law may provide that such a provision in the statutes may be relied on as against third parties on condition that it relates to the general power of representation; the question whether such a provision in the statutes can be relied on as against third parties shall be governed by Article 16.\nArticle 10\nDrawing up and certification of the instrument of constitution and the company statutes in due legal form\nIn all Member States whose laws do not provide for preventive administrative or judicial control, at the time of formation of a company, the instrument of constitution, the company statutes and any amendments to those documents shall be drawn up and certified in due legal form.\nArticle 11\nConditions for nullity of a company\nThe laws of the Member States may not provide for the nullity of companies otherwise than in accordance with the following provisions:\n(a)\nnullity must be ordered by decision of a court of law;\n(b)\nnullity may be ordered only on the grounds:\n(i)\nthat no instrument of constitution was executed or that the rules of preventive control or the requisite legal formalities were not complied with;\n(ii)\nthat the objects of the company are unlawful or contrary to public policy;\n(iii)\nthat the instrument of constitution or the statutes do not state the name of the company, the amount of the individual subscriptions of capital, the total amount of the capital subscribed or the objects of the company;\n(iv)\nof failure to comply with provisions of national law concerning the minimum amount of capital to be paid up;\n(v)\nof the incapacity of all the founder members;\n(vi)\nthat, contrary to the national law governing the company, the number of founder members is less than two.\nApart from the grounds of nullity referred to in the first paragraph, a company shall not be subject to any cause of non-existence, absolute nullity, relative nullity or declaration of nullity.\nArticle 12\nConsequences of nullity\n1.   The question whether a decision of nullity pronounced by a court of law may be relied on as against third parties shall be governed by Article 16. Where the national law entitles a third party to challenge the decision, he may do so only within six months of public notice of the decision of the court being given.\n2.   Nullity shall entail the winding-up of the company, as may dissolution.\n3.   Nullity shall not of itself affect the validity of any commitments entered into by or with the company, without prejudice to the consequences of the company's being wound up.\n4.   The laws of each Member State may make provision for the consequences of nullity as between members of the company.\n5.   Holders of shares in the capital of a company shall remain obliged to pay up the capital agreed to be subscribed by them but which has not been paid up, to the extent that commitments entered into with creditors so require.\nCHAPTER III\nDisclosure and interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 13\nScope\nThe coordination measures prescribed by this Section shall apply to the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the types of company listed in Annex II.\nArticle 14\nDocuments and particulars to be disclosed by companies\nMember States shall take the measures required to ensure compulsory disclosure by companies of at least the following documents and particulars:\n(a)\nthe instrument of constitution, and the statutes if they are contained in a separate instrument;\n(b)\nany amendments to the instruments referred to in point (a), including any extension of the duration of the company;\n(c)\nafter every amendment of the instrument of constitution or of the statutes, the complete text of the instrument or statutes as amended to date;\n(d)\nthe appointment, termination of office and particulars of the persons who either as a body constituted pursuant to law or as members of any such body:\n(i)\nare authorised to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings; it shall be apparent from the disclosure whether the persons authorised to represent the company may do so alone or are required to act jointly;\n(ii)\ntake part in the administration, supervision or control of the company;\n(e)\nat least once a year, the amount of the capital subscribed, where the instrument of constitution or the statutes mention an authorised capital, unless any increase in the capital subscribed necessitates an amendment of the statutes;\n(f)\nthe accounting documents for each financial year which are required to be published in accordance with Council Directives 86/635/EEC (26) and 91/674/EEC (27) and Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (28);\n(g)\nany change of the registered office of the company;\n(h)\nthe winding-up of the company;\n(i)\nany declaration of nullity of the company by the courts;\n(j)\nthe appointment of liquidators, particulars concerning them, and their respective powers, unless such powers are expressly and exclusively derived from law or from the statutes of the company;\n(k)\nany termination of a liquidation and, in Member States where striking off the register entails legal consequences, the fact of any such striking off.\nArticle 15\nChanges in documents and particulars\n1.

In the absence of coordination of national legislation on groups of companies, Member States may:\n(a)\ndefine the cases in which a public limited liability company shall be regarded as being able to exercise a dominant influence on another company; if a Member State exercises this option, its national law shall in any event provide that a dominant influence can be exercised if a public limited liability company:\n(i)\nhas the right to appoint or dismiss a majority of the members of the administrative organ, of the management organ or of the supervisory organ, and is at the same time a shareholder or member of the other company; or\n(ii)\nis a shareholder or member of the other company and has sole control of a majority of the voting rights of its shareholders or members under an agreement concluded with other shareholders or members of that company.\nMember States shall not be obliged to make provision for any cases other than those referred to in points (i) and (ii) of the first subparagraph;\n(b)\ndefine the cases in which a public limited liability company shall be regarded as indirectly holding voting rights or as able indirectly to exercise a dominant influence;\n(c)\nspecify the circumstances in which a public limited liability company shall be regarded as holding voting rights.\n3.   Member States need not apply the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph 1 where the subscription, acquisition or holding is effected on behalf of a person other than the person subscribing, acquiring or holding the shares, who is neither the public limited liability company referred to in paragraph 1 nor another company in which the public limited liability company directly or indirectly holds a majority of the voting rights or on which it can directly or indirectly exercise a dominant influence.\n4.   Member States need not apply the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph 1 where the subscription, acquisition or holding is effected by the other company in its capacity and in the context of its activities as a professional dealer in securities, provided that it is a member of a stock exchange situated or operating within a Member State, or is approved or supervised by an authority of a Member State competent to supervise professional dealers in securities which, within the meaning of this Directive, may include credit institutions.\n5.   Member States need not apply the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph 1 where shares in a public limited liability company held by another company were acquired before the relationship between the two companies corresponded to the criteria laid down in paragraph 1.\nHowever, the voting rights attached to those shares shall be suspended and the shares shall be taken into account when it is determined whether the condition laid down in Article 60(1)(b) is fulfilled.\n6.   Member States need not apply Article 61(2) or (3) or Article 62 where shares in a public limited liability company are acquired by another company on condition that they provide for:\n(a)\nthe suspension of the voting rights attached to the shares in the public limited liability company held by the other company; and\n(b)\nthe members of the administrative or the management organ of the public limited liability company to be obliged to buy back from the other company the shares referred to in Article 61(2) and (3) and Article 62 at the price at which the other company acquired them; this sanction shall be inapplicable only where the members of the administrative or the management organ of the public limited liability company prove that that company played no part whatsoever in the subscription for or acquisition of the shares in question.\nSection 5\nRules for the increase and reduction of capital\nArticle 68\nDecision by the general meeting on the increase of capital\n1.   Any increase in capital shall be decided upon by the general meeting. Both that decision and the increase in the subscribed capital shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 16.\n2.   Nevertheless, the statutes or instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, the decision of which is to be published in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph 1, may authorise an increase in the subscribed capital up to a maximum amount which they shall fix with due regard for any maximum amount provided for by law. Where appropriate, the increase in the subscribed capital shall be decided on within the limits of the amount fixed by the company body empowered to do so. The power of such body in this respect shall be for a maximum period of five years and may be renewed one or more times by the general meeting, each time for a period not exceeding five years.\n3.   Where there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning the increase in capital referred to in paragraph 1 or the authorisation to increase the capital referred to in paragraph 2, shall be subject to a separate vote at least for each class of shareholder whose rights are affected by the transaction.\n4.   This Article shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercise of the right to subscribe.\nArticle 69\nPaying up shares issued for consideration\nShares issued for consideration, in the course of an increase in subscribed capital, shall be paid up to at least 25 % of their nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, of their accountable par. Where provision is made for an issue premium, it shall be paid in full.\nArticle 70\nShares issued for consideration other than in cash\n1.   Where shares are issued for consideration other than in cash in the course of an increase in the subscribed capital, the consideration shall be transferred in full within a period of five years from the decision to increase the subscribed capital.\n2.   The consideration referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the subject of a report drawn up before the increase in capital is made by one or more experts who are independent of the company and appointed or approved by an administrative or judicial authority. Such experts may be natural persons as well as legal persons and companies and firms under the laws of each Member State.\nArticle 49(2) and (3) and Articles 50 and 51 shall apply.\n3.   Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 2 in the event of an increase in subscribed capital made in order to give effect to a merger, a division or a public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares and to pay the shareholders of the company which is being absorbed or divided, or which is the object of the public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares.\nIn the case of a merger or a division, however, Member States shall apply the first subparagraph only where a report by one or more independent experts on the draft terms of merger or division is drawn up.\nWhere Member States decide to apply paragraph 2 in the case of a merger or a division, they may provide that the report under this Article and the report by one or more independent experts on the draft terms of merger or division may be drawn up by the same expert or experts.\n4.   Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 2 if all the shares issued in the course of an increase in subscribed capital are issued for a consideration other than in cash to one or more companies, on condition that all the shareholders in the company which receive the consideration have agreed not to have an experts' report drawn up and that the requirements of points (b) to (f) of Article 49(4) are met.\nArticle 71\nIncrease in capital not fully subscribed\nWhere an increase in capital is not fully subscribed, the capital will be increased by the amount of the subscriptions received only if the conditions of the issue so provide.\nArticle 72\nIncrease in capital by consideration in cash\n1.   Whenever the capital is increased by consideration in cash, the shares shall be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the capital represented by their shares.\n2.   The laws of a Member State:\n(a)\nneed not apply paragraph 1 to shares which carry a limited right to participate in distributions within the meaning of Article 56 and/or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation; or\n(b)\nmay permit, where the subscribed capital of a company having several classes of shares carrying different rights with regard to voting, or participation in distributions within the meaning of Article 56 or in assets in the event of liquidation, is increased by issuing new shares in only one of these classes, the right of pre-emption of shareholders of the other classes to be exercised only after the exercise of this right by the shareholders of the class in which the new shares are being issued.\n3.   Any offer of subscription on a pre-emptive basis and the period within which this right shall be exercised shall be published in the national gazette appointed in accordance with Article 16. However, the laws of a Member State need not provide for such publication where all of a company's shares are registered. In such case, all the company's shareholders shall be informed in writing. The right of pre-emption shall be exercised within a period which shall not be less than 14 days from the date of publication of the offer or from the date of dispatch of the letters to the shareholders.\n4.   The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting. The administrative or management body shall be required to present to such a meeting a written report indicating the reasons for restriction or withdrawal of the right of pre-emption, and justifying the proposed issue price. The general meeting shall act in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article 83. Its decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 16.\n5.   The laws of a Member State may provide that the statutes, the instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, acting in accordance with the rules for a quorum, a majority and publication set out in paragraph 4 of this Article, may give the power to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption to the company body which is empowered to decide on an increase in subscribed capital within the limit of the authorised capital. This power may not be granted for a longer period than the power for which provision is made in Article 68(2).\n6.   Paragraphs 1 to 5 shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercise of the right to subscribe.\n7.   The right of pre-emption is not excluded for the purposes of paragraphs 4 and 5 where, in accordance with the decision to increase the subscribed capital, shares are issued to banks or other financial institutions with a view to their being offered to shareholders of the company in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3.\nArticle 73\nDecision by the general meeting on reduction in the subscribed capital\nAny reduction in the subscribed capital, except under a court order, shall be subject at least to a decision of the general meeting acting in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article 83 without prejudice to Articles 79 and 80. Such decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 16.\nThe notice convening the meeting shall specify at least the purpose of the reduction and the way in which it is to be carried out.\nArticle 74\nReduction in the subscribed capital in case of several classes of shares\nWhere there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning a reduction in the subscribed capital shall be subject to a separate vote, at least for each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction.\nArticle 75\nSafeguards for creditors in case of reduction in the subscribed capital\n1.   In the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, at least the creditors whose claims antedate the publication of the decision on the reduction shall at least have the right to obtain security for claims which have not fallen due by the date of that publication. Member States may not set aside such a right unless the creditor has adequate safeguards, or unless such safeguards are not necessary having regard to the assets of the company.\nMember States shall lay down the conditions for the exercise of the right provided for in the first subparagraph. In any event, Member States shall ensure that the creditors are authorised to apply to the appropriate administrative or judicial authority for adequate safeguards provided that they can credibly demonstrate that due to the reduction in the subscribed capital the satisfaction of their claims is at stake, and that no adequate safeguards have been obtained from the company.\n2.   The laws of the Member States shall also stipulate at least that the reduction shall be void, or that no payment may be made for the benefit of the shareholders, until the creditors have obtained satisfaction or a court has decided that their application should not be acceded to.\n3.   This Article shall apply where the reduction in the subscribed capital is brought about by the total or partial waiving of the payment of the balance of the shareholders' contributions.\nArticle 76\nDerogation from safeguards for creditors in case of reduction in the subscribed capital\n1.   Member States need not apply Article 75 to a reduction in the subscribed capital the purpose of which is to offset losses incurred or to include sums of money in a reserve provided that, following this operation, the amount of such reserve is not more than 10 % of the reduced subscribed capital. Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders; it may be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of such reserve, in so far as the Member States permit such an operation.\n2.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the laws of the Member States shall at least provide for the measures necessary to ensure that the amounts deriving from the reduction of subscribed capital may not be used for making payments or distributions to shareholders, or discharging shareholders from the obligation to make their contributions.\nArticle 77\nReduction in the subscribed capital and the minimum capital\nThe subscribed capital may not be reduced to an amount less than the minimum capital laid down in accordance with Article 45.\nHowever, Member States may permit such a reduction if they also provide that the decision to reduce the subscribed capital may take effect only when the subscribed capital is increased to an amount at least equal to the prescribed minimum.\nArticle 78\nRedemption of subscribed capital without reduction\nWhere the laws of a Member State authorise total or partial redemption of the subscribed capital without reduction of the latter, they shall at least require that the following conditions are observed:\n(a)\nwhere the statutes or instrument of incorporation provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided on by the general meeting voting at least under the usual conditions of quorum and majority; where the statutes or instrument of incorporation do not provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided upon by the general meeting acting at least under the conditions of quorum and majority laid down in Article 83; the decision shall be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of Member States, in accordance with Article 16;\n(b)\nonly sums which are available for distribution within the meaning of Article 56(1) to (4) may be used for redemption purposes;\n(c)\nshareholders whose shares are redeemed shall retain their rights in the company, with the exception of their rights to the repayment of their investment and participation in the distribution of an initial dividend on unredeemed shares.\nArticle 79\nReduction in the subscribed capital by compulsory withdrawal of shares\n1.   Where the laws of a Member State allow companies to reduce their subscribed capital by compulsory withdrawal of shares, they shall require that at least the following conditions are observed:\n(a)\ncompulsory withdrawal must be prescribed or authorised by the statutes or instrument of incorporation before the shares which are to be withdrawn are subscribed for;\n(b)\nwhere the compulsory withdrawal is authorised merely by the statutes or instrument of incorporation, it shall be decided upon by the general meeting unless it has been unanimously approved by the shareholders concerned;\n(c)\nthe company body deciding on the compulsory withdrawal shall fix the terms and manner thereof, where they have not already been fixed by the statutes or instrument of incorporation;\n(d)\nArticle 75 shall apply except in the case of fully paid-up shares which are made available to the company free of charge or are withdrawn using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 56(1) to (4); in these cases, an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the withdrawn shares must be included in a reserve; except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders; it can be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of such reserve, in so far as Member States permit such an operation; and\n(e)\nthe decision on compulsory withdrawal shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 16.\n2.   The first paragraph of Article 73 and Articles 74, 76 and 83 shall not apply to the cases to which paragraph 1 of this Article refers.\nArticle 80\nReduction in the subscribed capital by the withdrawal of shares acquired by the company itself or on its behalf\n1.   In the case of a reduction in the subscribed capital by the withdrawal of shares acquired by the company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on behalf of the company, the withdrawal shall always be decided on by the general meeting.\n2.   Article 75 shall apply unless the shares are fully paid up and are acquired free of charge or using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 56(1) to (4); in these cases an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the shares withdrawn shall be included in a reserve. Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders. It may be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of such reserve, in so far as the Member States permit such an operation.\n3.   Articles 74, 76 and 83 shall not apply to the cases to which paragraph 1 of this Article refers.\nArticle 81\nRedemption of the subscribed capital or its reduction by withdrawal of shares in case of several classes of shares\nIn the cases covered by Article 78, Article 79(1)(b) and Article 80(1), when there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning redemption of the subscribed capital or its reduction by withdrawal of shares shall be subject to a separate vote, at least for each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction.\nArticle 82\nConditions for redemption of shares\nWhere the laws of a Member State authorise companies to issue redeemable shares, they shall require that the following conditions, at least, are complied with for the redemption of such shares:\n(a)\nredemption must be authorised by the company's statutes or instrument of incorporation before the redeemable shares are subscribed for;\n(b)\nthe shares must be fully paid up;\n(c)\nthe terms and the manner of redemption must be laid down in the company's statutes or instrument of incorporation;\n(d)\nredemption can be only effected by using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 56(1) to (4) or the proceeds of a new issue made with a view to effecting such redemption;\n(e)\nan amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the redeemed shares must be included in a reserve which cannot be distributed to the shareholders, except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital; it may be used only for the purpose of increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of reserves;\n(f)\npoint (e) shall not apply to redemption using the proceeds of a new issue made with a view to effecting such redemption;\n(g)\nwhere provision is made for the payment of a premium to shareholders in consequence of a redemption, the premium may be paid only from sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 56(1) to (4), or from a reserve other than that referred to in point (e) of this Article which may not be distributed to shareholders except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital; this reserve may be used only for the purposes of increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of reserves or for covering the costs referred to in point (j) of Article 4 or the cost of issuing shares or debentures or for the payment of a premium to holders of redeemable shares or debentures;\n(h)\nnotification of redemption shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 16.\nArticle 83\nVoting requirements for the decisions of the general meeting\nThe laws of the Member States shall provide that the decisions referred to in Article 72(4) and (5) and Articles 73, 74, 78 and 81 are to be taken at least by a majority of not less than two thirds of the votes attaching to the securities or the subscribed capital represented.\nThe laws of the Member States may, however, lay down that a simple majority of the votes specified in the first paragraph is sufficient when at least half the subscribed capital is represented.\nSection 6\nApplication and implementing arrangements\nArticle 84\nDerogation from certain requirements\n1.   Member States may derogate from the first paragraph of Article 48, the first sentence of Article 60(1)(a) and Articles 68, 69 and 72 to the extent that such derogations are necessary for the adoption or application of provisions designed to encourage the participation of employees, or other groups of persons defined by national law, in the capital of undertakings.\n2.

Member States shall ensure that Article 49, Articles 58(1) and 68(1), (2) and (3), the first subparagraph of Article 70(2), Articles 72 to 75, 79, 80 and 81 do not apply in the case of use of the resolution tools, powers and mechanisms provided for in Title IV of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (34).\nArticle 85\nEqual treatment of all shareholders who are in the same position\nFor the purposes of the implementation of this Chapter, the laws of the Member States shall ensure equal treatment to all shareholders who are in the same position.\nArticle 86\nTransitional provisions\nMember States may decide not to apply points (g), (i), (j) and (k) of Article 4 to companies already in existence at the date of entry into force of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted in order to comply with Council Directive 77/91/EEC (35).\nTITLE II\nMERGERS AND DIVISIONS OF LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES\nCHAPTER I\nMergers of public limited liability companies\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions on mergers\nArticle 87\nGeneral provisions\n1.

In each Member State concerned the authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall issue, without delay to each merging company subject to that State's national law, a certificate conclusively attesting to the proper completion of the pre-merger acts and formalities.\n3.   If the law of a Member State to which a merging company is subject provides for a procedure to scrutinise and amend the ratio applicable to the exchange of securities or shares, or a procedure to compensate minority members, without preventing the registration of the cross-border merger, such procedure shall only apply if the other merging companies situated in Member States which do not provide for such procedure explicitly accept, when approving the draft terms of the cross-border merger in accordance with Article 126(1), the possibility for the members of that merging company to have recourse to such procedure, to be initiated before the court having jurisdiction over that merging company. In such cases, the authority referred to in paragraph 1 may issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 even if such procedure has commenced.

Deletion of the old registration, if applicable, shall be effected on receipt of that notification, and not before.\nArticle 131\nConsequences of a cross-border merger\n1.

The rights and obligations of the merging companies arising from contracts of employment or from employment relationships and existing at the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect shall, by reason of that cross-border merger taking effect, be transferred to the company resulting from the cross-border merger on the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect.\n5.   No shares in the acquiring company shall be exchanged for shares in the company being acquired held either:\n(a)\nby the acquiring company itself or through a person acting in his or her own name but on its behalf;\n(b)\nby the company being acquired itself or through a person acting in his or her own name but on its behalf.\nArticle 132\nSimplified formalities\n1.

Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the company resulting from the cross-border merger shall be subject to the rules in force concerning employee participation, if any, in the Member State where it has its registered office.\n2.   However, the rules in force concerning employee participation, if any, in the Member State where the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office shall not apply, where at least one of the merging companies has, in the six months prior to the publication of the draft terms of the cross-border merger as referred to in Article 123, an average number of employees that exceeds 500 and is operating under an employee participation system within the meaning of point (k) of Article 2 of Directive 2001/86/EC, or where the national law applicable to the company resulting from the cross-border merger does not:\n(a)\nprovide for at least the same level of employee participation as operated in the relevant merging companies, measured by reference to the proportion of employee representatives amongst the members of the administrative or supervisory organ or their committees or of the management group which covers the profit units of the company, subject to employee representation; or\n(b)\nprovide for employees of establishments of the company resulting from the cross-border merger that are situated in other Member States the same entitlement to exercise participation rights as is enjoyed by those employees employed in the Member State where the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office.\n3.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 2, the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger and their involvement in the definition of such rights shall be regulated by the Member States, mutatis mutandis and subject to paragraphs 4 to 7, in accordance with the principles and procedures laid down in Article 12(2), (3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 and the following provisions of Directive 2001/86/EC:\n(a)\nArticle 3(1), (2) and (3), the first indent of the first subparagraph of Article 3(4), the second subparagraph of Article 3(4) and Article 3(5) and (7);\n(b)\nArticle 4(1), Article 4(2)(a), (g) and (h) and Article 4(3);\n(c)\nArticle 5;\n(d)\nArticle 6;\n(e)\nArticle 7(1), point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(2), the second subparagraph of Article 7(2) and Article 7(3).

However, if in one of the merging companies employee representatives constituted at least one third of the administrative or supervisory board, the limitation may never result in a lower proportion of employee representatives in the administrative organ than one third.\n5.   The extension of participation rights to employees of the company resulting from the cross-border merger employed in other Member States, referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2, shall not entail any obligation for Member States which choose to do so to take those employees into account when calculating the size of workforce thresholds giving rise to participation rights under national law.\n6.   Where at least one of the merging companies is operating under an employee participation system and the company resulting from the cross-border merger is to be governed by such a system in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph 2, that company shall be obliged to take a legal form allowing for the exercise of participation rights.\n7.   Where the company resulting from the cross-border merger is operating under an employee participation system, that company shall be obliged to take measures to ensure that employees' participation rights are protected in the event of subsequent domestic mergers for a period of three years after the cross-border merger has taken effect, by applying mutatis mutandis the rules laid down in this Article.\nArticle 134\nValidity\nA cross-border merger which has taken effect as provided for in Article 129 may not be declared null and void.\nCHAPTER III\nDivisions of public limited liability companies\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 135\nGeneral provisions on division operations\n1.

That reference shall include the date of publication of the draft terms of division on the website and shall be accessible to the public free of charge. Companies shall not be charged a specific fee for such publication.\nThe prohibition precluding the charging to companies of a specific fee for publication, laid down in the third and fourth paragraphs, shall not affect the ability of Member States to pass on to companies the costs in respect of the central electronic platform.\nMember States may require companies to maintain the information for a specific period after the general meeting on their website or, where applicable, on the central electronic platform or the other website designated by the Member State concerned.

For the purpose of paragraph 1, the laws of the Member States shall at least provide that such creditors shall be entitled to obtain adequate safeguards where the financial situation of the company being divided, and that of the company to which the obligation is to be transferred in accordance with the draft terms of division, make such protection necessary, and where those creditors do not already have such safeguards.\nMember States shall lay down the conditions for the protection provided for in paragraph 1 and in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. In any event, Member States shall ensure that the creditors are authorised to apply to the appropriate administrative or judicial authority for adequate safeguards provided that they can credibly demonstrate that due to the division the satisfaction of their claims is at stake and that no adequate safeguards have been obtained from the company.\n3.   In so far as a creditor of the company to which the obligation has been transferred in accordance with the draft terms of division has not obtained satisfaction, the recipient companies shall be jointly and severally liable for that obligation. Member States may limit that liability to the net assets allocated to each of those companies other than the one to which the obligation has been transferred. However, they need not apply this paragraph where the division operation is subject to the supervision of a judicial authority in accordance with Article 157 and a majority in number representing three-quarters in value of the creditors or any class of creditors of the company being divided have agreed to forego such joint and several liability at a meeting held pursuant to point (c) of Article 157(l).\n4.

A division shall have the following consequences ipso jure and simultaneously:\n(a)\nthe transfer, both as between the company being divided and the recipient companies and as regards third parties, to each of the recipient companies of all the assets and liabilities of the company being divided; such transfer shall take effect with the assets and liabilities being divided in accordance with the allocation laid down in the draft terms of division or in Article 137(3);\n(b)\nthe shareholders of the company being divided become shareholders of one or more of the recipient companies in accordance with the allocation laid down in the draft terms of division;\n(c)\nthe company being divided ceases to exist.\n2.   No shares in a recipient company shall be exchanged for shares held in the company being divided either:\n(a)\nby that recipient company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on its behalf; or\n(b)\nby the company being divided itself or by a person acting in his own name but on its behalf.\n3.   The foregoing shall not affect the laws of Member States which require the completion of special formalities for the transfer of certain assets, rights and obligations by a company being divided to be effective as against third parties. The recipient company or companies to which such assets, rights or obligations are transferred in accordance with the draft terms of division or with Article 137(3) may carry out those formalities themselves; however, the laws of Member States may permit a company being divided to continue to carry out those formalities for a limited period which may not, save in exceptional circumstances, be fixed at more than six months from the date on which the division takes effect.\nArticle 152\nCivil liability of members of the administrative or management bodies of a company being divided\nThe laws of Member States shall at least lay down rules governing the civil liability of members of the administrative or management bodies of a company being divided towards the shareholders of that company in respect of misconduct on the part of members of those bodies in preparing and implementing the division and the civil liability of the experts responsible for drawing up for that company the report provided for in Article 142 in respect of misconduct on the part of those experts in the performance of their duties.\nArticle 153\nConditions for nullity of a division\n1.   The laws of Member States may lay down nullity rules for divisions in accordance with the following conditions only:\n(a)\nnullity must be ordered in a court judgment;\n(b)\ndivisions which have taken effect pursuant to Article 149 are declared void only if there has been no judicial or administrative preventive supervision of their legality, or if they have not been drawn up and certified in due legal form, or if it is shown that the decision of the general meeting is void or voidable under national law;\n(c)\nnullification proceedings are not initiated more than six months after the date on which the division becomes effective as against the person alleging nullity or if the situation has been rectified;\n(d)\nwhere it is possible to remedy a defect liable to render a division void, the competent court grants the companies involved a period of time within which to rectify the situation;\n(e)\na judgment declaring a division void is published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 16;\n(f)\nwhere the laws of a Member State permit a third party to challenge such a judgment, he does so only within six months of publication of the judgment in the manner prescribed by Chapter III of Title I;\n(g)\na judgment declaring a division void does not of itself affect the validity of obligations owed by or in relation to the recipient companies which arose before the judgment was published and after the date referred to in Article 149;\n(h)\neach of the recipient companies is liable for its obligations arising after the date on which the division took effect and before the date on which the decision pronouncing the nullity of the division was published. The company being divided shall also be liable for such obligations; Member States may provide that this liability be limited to the share of net assets transferred to the recipient company on whose account such obligations arose.\n2.   By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the laws of a Member State may also provide for the nullity of a division to be ordered by an administrative authority if an appeal against such a decision lies to a court.

For the purposes of this Chapter, ‘division by the formation of new companies’ means the operation whereby, after being wound up without going into liquidation, a company transfers to more than one newly-formed company all its assets and liabilities in exchange for the allocation to the shareholders of the company being divided of shares in the recipient companies, and possibly a cash payment not exceeding 10 % of the nominal value of the shares allocated or, where they have no nominal value, of their accounting par value.\n2.

companies\nCertain aspects of company law concerning limited liability companies\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective (EU) 2017/1132 – codification of certain aspects of company law concerning limited liability companies\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nDirective (EU) 2017/1132 brings together a large part of European Union (EU) company law rules in one single directive. It covers issues such as their formation, capital and disclosure requirements, and operations (such as mergers and divisions) of companies.\nOriginally, it codified six previous EU company law directives (Directives 82/891/EEC, 89/666/EEC, 2005/56/EC, 2009/101/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU) without changing their contents.\nSince then, this directive has been amended by Directive 2019/1151 on the use of digital tools and processes in company law and by Directive 2019/2121 on cross-border conversions, divisions and mergers. It was also amended by Directive (EU) 2019/1023 , specifically to allow Member States to allow exceptions from certain articles of Directive (EU) 2017/1132, when this is necessary to establish preventive restructuring frameworks.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nDirective (EU) 2017/1132 brings together rules on the following issues:\nestablishing public limited liability companies*, determining the validity of their obligations and nullity, and maintaining and modifying their capital;\nthe formation of companies and branches online and filing of company information with business registers fully online, i.e. without having to appear in person before the competent authorities, including safeguards (e.g. the possibility to require physical presence in exceptional cases);\ndisclosure requirements for public and private limited liability companies in general and for branches opened in a Member State by public and private limited liability companies governed by the law of other EU Member States or by equivalent non-EU companies;\nrules on the business registers interconnection system, which interconnects national business registers and makes information about limited liability companies* available to the public through a single access point, the European e-Justice portal, and provides secure means for exchange of information between business registers (e.g. on branches, cross-border operations, disqualified directors);\nmergers and divisions of public limited liability companies within one Member State (steps of the merger/division procedure and documents necessary for a merger/division, when a merger/division takes effect and its consequences, safeguards for third parties such as creditors, minority shareholders and employees);\nconversions, mergers and divisions of private and public limited liability companies based in different Member States (conditions applicable, steps of the cross-border operation procedure, including mandatory anti-abuse measures to ensure that no operations are authorised if they are carried out for abusive, fraudulent or criminal purposes, documents necessary for a cross-border operation, safeguards for minority shareholders, creditors and employees when a cross-border operation takes effect and its consequences).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\nDirective (EU) 2017/1132 entered into force on 20 July 2017. Because it codifies existing legislation, no additional transposition by Member States into national law is necessary. The time limits by which the repealed directives had to be transposed into national law are set out in Annex III.\nAmendments introduced by Directive (EU) 2019/1023 entered into force on 16 July 2019.\nAmendments introduced by Directive (EU) 2019/1151 entered into force on 31 July 2019. Member States needed to transpose this directive by August 2021 (with a longer deadline for some specific provisions). A number of Member States took advantage of the possibility provided by the directive to extend the transposition by 1 year, i.e. by August 2022.\nAmendments introduced by Directive (EU) 2019/2121 entered into force on 1 January 2020. Member States need to transpose this directive by January 2023.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nCodification is the process of bringing together a legislative act – or two or more related acts – and all related amendments in a single new act without introducing any real changes. In the area of company law, where the relevant rules are spread across many different legal acts – with the first directives dating from the 1960s and 1970s, and many amendments made since – it was not easy for users to have a clear overview of EU law in this policy area. Directive (EU) 2017/1132 brings together the rules established by the repealed directives, without changing their content or adding new rules.\nFor further information, see:\nCompany law and corporate governance (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPublic limited liability company. A limited liability company that has offered shares to the general public.\nLimited liability company. A company with share capital and with legal personality possessing separate assets that alone serve to cover its debts.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 relating to certain aspects of company law (codification) (OJ L 169, 30.6.2017, pp. 46–127).\nSuccessive amendments to Directive (EU) 2017/1132 have been incorporated into the original text.
