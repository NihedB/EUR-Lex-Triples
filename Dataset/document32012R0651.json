In the interests of transparency and legal certainty, it is therefore necessary to introduce binding rules for the issuance of euro coins.\n(3)\nIn accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro (5), coins denominated in euro and cent and complying with the denominations and technical specifications laid down by the Council have the status of legal tender in all Member States whose currency is the euro. Denominations and technical specifications of euro coins are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98 of 3 May 1998 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation (6).\n(4)\nMember States whose currency is the euro should also be able to issue 2-euro commemorative coins to celebrate specific subjects, subject to limits set per year and per issuing Member State for the number of issues of such coins. It is necessary to establish certain volume limits for commemorative euro coins in order to ensure that such coins remain a minor percentage of the total number of the 2-euro coins in circulation. Such volume limits should, however, allow for the issuance of a sufficient volume of coins to ensure that commemorative euro coins can circulate effectively.\n(5)\nMember States whose currency is the euro should also be able to issue euro collector coins, which are not intended for circulation and which should be readily distinguishable from circulation coins. Euro collector coins should have the status of legal tender only in the Member State of issuance and should not be issued with a view to their entry into circulation.\n(6)\nIt is appropriate that issuances of euro collector coins are accounted for in the volume of coins to be approved by the European Central Bank, but on an aggregate basis rather than for each individual issue.\n(7)\nThe use of different denominations of euro coins and euro banknotes, as currently devised, should be periodically and carefully examined by the competent institutions against the criteria of cost and public acceptability. In particular, the Commission should conduct an impact assessment on the continued issuance of 1- and 2-cent coins.\n(8)\nIn order to avoid that fit euro circulation coins are destroyed by one Member State while there may be a need of such coins in another, Member States should consult each other prior to the destruction of such coins,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘circulation coins’ means euro coins intended for circulation, the denominations and technical specifications of which are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 975/98;\n(2)\n‘commemorative coins’ means circulation coins, which are intended to commemorate a specific subject as specified in Article 1h of Regulation (EC) No 975/98;\n(3)\n‘collector coins’ means euro coins intended for collection that are not issued with a view to their entry into circulation.\nArticle 2\nTypes of euro coin\n1.   Member States may issue two types of euro coin: circulation coins and collector coins.\n2.   The Commission shall conduct an impact assessment on the continued issuance of 1- and 2-cent coins. That impact assessment shall include a cost-benefit analysis which takes into account the real production costs of those coins set against their value and benefits.\nArticle 3\nIssuance of circulation coins\n1.   Circulation coins shall be issued and put into circulation at face value.\n2.   A minor proportion, not exceeding 5 % of the cumulated total net value and volume of circulation coins issued by a Member State, taking into account only years with positive net issuance, may be put on the market above face value if justified by the special quality of the coin, a special packaging or any additional services provided.\nArticle 4\nIssuance of commemorative coins\n1.   Each Member State whose currency is the euro may only issue two commemorative coins per year, save where:\n(a)\ncommemorative coins are collectively issued by all Member States whose currency is the euro; or\n(b)\na commemorative coin is issued on the occasion of a temporary vacancy or a provisional occupation of the function of Head of State.\n2.   The total number of commemorative coins put into circulation for each individual issue shall not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:\n(a)\n0,1 % of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by all Member States whose currency is the euro up to the beginning of the year preceding the year of issuance of the commemorative coin; this ceiling may be raised to 2,0 % of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins of all Member States whose currency is the euro if a widely recognised and highly symbolic subject is commemorated, in which case the issuing Member State shall refrain from launching another commemorative coin issue using the raised ceiling during the subsequent four years and shall set out the reasons for choosing the raised ceiling; or\n(b)\n5,0 % of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by the Member State concerned up to the beginning of the year preceding the year of issuance of the commemorative coin.\n3.   The decision whether to issue commemorative coins with a common design collectively issued by all Member States whose currency is the euro shall be taken by the Council. The voting rights of the Member States whose currency is not the euro shall be suspended for the adoption of that decision.\nArticle 5\nIssuance of collector coins\n1.   Collector coins shall have the status of legal tender only in the issuing Member State.\nThe identity of the issuing Member State shall be clearly and easily recognisable on the coin.\n2.   In order to be easily differentiated from circulation coins, collector coins shall meet all of the following criteria:\n(a)\ntheir face value must be different from the face values of circulation coins;\n(b)\ntheir images must not be similar to the common sides of circulation coins, and if their images are similar to any national side of circulation coins, their overall appearance can still be easily differentiated;\n(c)\ntheir colour, diameter and weight must differ significantly from circulation coins for at least two of these three characteristics; the difference shall be regarded as significant if the values including tolerances are outside the tolerance ranges fixed for circulation coins; and\n(d)\nthey must not have a shaped edge with fine scallops or a ‘Spanish flower’ shape.\n3.   Collector coins may be put on the market at or above face value.\n4.   The issuances of collector coins shall be accounted for on an aggregated basis in the volume of coin issuance to be approved by the European Central Bank.\n5.   Member States shall take all appropriate measures to discourage the use of collector coins as a means of payment.\nArticle 6\nConsultation prior to the destruction of circulation coins\nPrior to the destruction of circulation coins which are not euro coins unfit for circulation within the meaning of point (b) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1210/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2010 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation (7), Member States shall consult each other via the relevant subcommittee of the Economic and Financial Committee and inform the mint directors of the Member States whose currency is the euro.\nArticle 7\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.\nDone at Strasbourg, 4 July 2012.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.

This allows for objections from\na government that believes the design would upset its own public;\nthe Commission, if it considers the design does not respect the legislation’s technical requirements.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\nRegulation (EU) No 651/2012 has applied since 16 August 2012.\nRegulation (EU) No 729/2014 consolidates former rules regarding coins set when the euro was introduced in 2002 by the Regulation (EC) No 975/98 and successive amendments. It has applied since 22 July 2014.\nBoth Regulations have integrated the elements of the Commission Recommendation 2009/23/EC on common guidelines for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation.\nBACKGROUND\nEuro coins came into general use in 2002. The eight denominations vary in size, colour and thickness depending on their value and are designed to make any illegal reproduction extremely difficult.\nFor more information, see:\n‘Euro notes and coins’ (European Commission).\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nCirculation coins: coins for general public use which are legal tender in all euro area countries.\nCollector coins: coins not intended for circulation, which are legal tender only in the euro area country where they are issued.\nCommemorative coins: 2-euro circulation coins to commemorate a specific subject of national or European importance.\nLegal tender: coins or banknotes that must be accepted in a country if offered in payment of a debt.\nRegular coins: circulation coins excluding commemorative coins.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 651/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on the issuance of euro coins (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, pp. 135–137)\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 729/2014 of 24 June 2014 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation (Recast) (OJ L 194, 2.7.2014, pp. 1–7)\nlast update 04.04.2017", "tags": ["money", "technical specification", "commemoration", "euro", "issuing of currency"], "subjects": ["Economic and Monetary Union"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
