{"celex_id": "32007R0498", "reference": "10.5.2007\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 120/1\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 498/2007\nof 26 March 2007\nlaying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (1), and in particular Article 102 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 1198/2006 (the basic Regulation) replaces Council Regulations (EC) No 1263/1999 (2) and (EC) No 2792/1999 (3) taking into account new developments in the field of fisheries, fisheries areas and inland fishing. It is therefore appropriate to lay down detailed rules for implementing the basic Regulation.\n(2)\nDetailed rules should be laid down for the presentation of operational programmes. In order to facilitate the establishment of the operational programmes and their examination and approval by the Commission, common rules should be laid down for the structure and content of such programmes, based in particular on the requirements set out in Article 20 of the basic Regulation.\n(3)\nAs regards support for measures for the adaptation of the Community fishing fleet, the Member States should present in their operational programmes the methods for the calculation of premiums.\n(4)\nAs regards the possibility provided for under Article 25(4) of the basic Regulation to achieve the reduction of engine power by a group of vessels, the conditions for this possibility should be specified.\n(5)\nCertain terms used with special reference to aquaculture and the processing and marketing of fisheries and aquaculture products, should be defined to ensure that they are uniformly understood.\n(6)\nAs regards support for productive investments in aquaculture and investments in processing and marketing, the Member States should explain in their operational programmes how they will ensure that priority is given to micro and small enterprises.\n(7)\nAs regards support for animal heath measures, detailed conditions should be laid down to ensure compliance with the Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (4).\n(8)\nAs regards support for measure of common interest, the eligible expenditure should be defined.\n(9)\nAs regards the fisheries areas referred to in Article 43 of the basic Regulation, the conditions for their selection should be specified.\n(10)\nThe public-private partnerships supported under Article 45 of the basic Regulation should comply with certain detailed conditions.\n(11)\nAs regards support for the sustainable development of fisheries areas, the procedures for selecting groups should be transparent in order to ensure that pertinent and high quality local development strategies are selected for support.\n(12)\nRules common to several measures should be laid down. In particular, in order to ensure a better targeting of investment operations, a set of common rules for the definition of eligible expenditure should be made available.\n(13)\nIn order to guarantee that information on possible funding opportunities is disseminated widely to all interested parties and for the sake of transparency, the minimum content of the information measures needed to inform potential beneficiaries about the financing opportunities offered jointly by the Community and the Member States through the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), including an obligation to publicise the steps that a potential beneficiary should take in order to submit an application for funding and the selection criteria that are to be used, should be set out taking into account the principle of proportionality.\n(14)\nIn order to enhance transparency regarding the use of EFF assistance, the list of beneficiaries, the names of the operations and the amount of the public funding allocated to operations should be published annually by Member States, electronically or otherwise. Making such information accessible to the public aims to strengthen the transparency of the Community's action in the area of the development of the fisheries sector, fisheries areas and inland fishing, to enhance the sound financial management of the public funds involved and, in particular, to reinforce control of the public money used and finally to avoid any distortion of competition between beneficiaries of EFF measures. Given the overriding weight of the objectives pursued, it is justified with regard to the principle of proportionality and the requirement of the protection of personal data, to provide for the general publication of the relevant information as it does not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society and for prevention of irregularities.\n(15)\nIn order to ensure a better implementation of the information measures and to allow a better exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission on the information and publicity strategies and results, contact persons responsible for the information and publicity measures should be designated.\n(16)\nBuilding on the experience of the 2000-2006 programming period, it is necessary to set out in detail the conditions which financial engineering instruments should fulfil in order to be funded under an operational programme.\n(17)\nWith regard to Article 59 of the basic Regulation and in the light of the experience gained, it is necessary to lay down the obligations which the managing authorities should have with regard to beneficiaries in the phase leading to the selection and approval of the operations to be funded, with regard to the aspects which the verifications of the expenditure declared by the beneficiary should cover, including administrative verifications of the applications for reimbursement, and on-the-spot verifications of individual operations and with regard to the conditions to be observed when on-the-spot verifications are carried out on a sample basis.\n(18)\nIt is also necessary to set out in detail the information which should be included in the accounting records of operations and the information to be kept as data on implementation which the managing authorities should record, store and submit to the Commission upon request.\n(19)\nIn order to ensure that expenditure under operational programmes can be properly audited, it is necessary to set out the criteria that an audit trail should comply with in order to be considered adequate.\n(20)\nThe audit of operations is carried out under the responsibility of the audit authority. To ensure that the scope and effectiveness of those audits are adequate and that they are carried out according to the same standards in all Member States, it is necessary to set out the conditions which those audits should fulfil.\n(21)\nExperience has shown that it is necessary to set out in detail the basis for the sampling of operations to be audited, which the audit authority should observe in establishing or approving the sampling method, including certain technical criteria to be used for a random statistical sample and factors to be taken into account for a complementary sample.\n(22)\nIn order to simplify and harmonise standards for the preparation and presentation of the audit strategy, the annual control report and the closure declarations for which the audit authority is responsible under Article 61 of the basic Regulation, it is necessary to lay down detailed rules concerning their content and specify the nature and quality of the information on which they rely.\n(23)\nIn order to ensure the most effective application of Article 87 of the basic Regulation with regard to the availability of documents and the rights of the Court of Auditors and the Commission to have access to all supporting documents regarding expenditure and audits, managing authorities should ensure that information on the identity and location of the bodies holding the supporting documents is readily available and those documents should be readily provided to a minimum list of persons and bodies. For the same purpose, it is necessary to set out which data carriers may be considered as commonly accepted for the purpose of keeping such documents. To that end, the national authorities should lay down the procedures necessary to ensure that the documents kept are in conformity with the originals, when this is relevant, and can be relied on for audit purposes.\n(24)\nIn order to harmonise standards for the certification of expenditure and for the preparation of applications for payments, the content of such certificates and applications should be laid down and the nature and quality of the information, on which they rely, specified. Detailed procedures should be set out for keeping, in accordance with Article 60(f) of the basic Regulation, an account of amounts recoverable and of amounts withdrawn following cancellation of all or part of the contribution for an operation and for informing the Commission accordingly.\n(25)\nUnder Article 71 of the basic Regulation, the Member States are required before the submission of the first application for interim payment or at least within twelve months after the approval of the operational programme, to submit to the Commission a description of the management and control systems, a report setting out the results of an assessment of the systems set up and an opinion on their compliance with the provisions of that Regulation on management and control systems. Since those documents are among the principal elements that the Commission relies on, in the context of the shared management of the Community budget, to satisfy itself that the financial assistance concerned is used by the Member States in accordance with the applicable rules and principles necessary for protecting the Community's financial interests, it is necessary to set out in detail the information that such documents should contain and the basis for the assessment and the opinion.\n(26)\nArticle 57 of the basic Regulation provides that the arrangements for auditing are to be proportionate to the total amount of public expenditure allocated to the operational programme concerned. Where the public expenditure allocated to the operational programme is limited, it is appropriate that there should be an option for the Member State to rely more on national bodies and rules for carrying out certain functions related to the control and audit arrangements and that the Commission should therefore specify which verifications, which audits of operations and which obligations may be carried out and executed according to national rules and by national bodies. In those circumstances, the Commission should also differentiate between the means by which Member States have to fulfil the functions of certification of expenditure and verification of the management and control system and establish the conditions under which it may limit its own audit and rely on assurances provided by national bodies.\n(27)\nAs part of their management and control obligations, Member States are required to report and monitor irregularities. Detailed rules to implement that requirement were laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 of 11 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums unduly paid in connection with the financing of the structural policies and the organisation of an information system in this field (5). It is appropriate, for reasons of clarity and simplification, to incorporate those rules into this Regulation.\n(28)\nProvision should be made for the Commission to reimburse judicial costs when it requests a Member State to initiate or continue legal proceedings with a view to recovering amounts unduly paid following an irregularity, and for it to be provided with information enabling it to decide on the apportionment of the loss from irrecoverable amounts under Article 70(2) of the basic Regulation. Regular contact should also be provided for between the Commission and the Member States on the subject of irregularities, for the use of the information provided for making risk analyses and compiling reports, and for the provision of information to the relevant committees.\n(29)\nIn order to limit the administrative burden imposed by the reporting system while safeguarding the necessary level of information, Member States should, without prejudice to the obligations arising directly from Article 60(f) of the basic Regulation, not be obliged to report irregularities involving amounts below a certain threshold unless the Commission expressly so requests.\n(30)\nThe use of electronic means for the exchange of information and financial data leads to simplification, increased efficiency and transparency and to savings in time. In order to exploit those advantages fully, while preserving the security of exchanges, a common computer system should be established as well as a list of documents of common interest to the Commission and the Member States. It is therefore necessary to specify the format each document should have, and to provide a detailed description of the information such documents should contain. For the same reasons, it is necessary to specify how such a computer system functions with regard to the identification of the party responsible for uploading the documents and any updates thereto.\n(31)\nIn accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures (6), taking account of the level of security and confidentiality required for the financial management of funds from the EFF, of the state of the art and of a cost-benefit analysis, it is necessary to require the use of an electronic signature.\n(32)\nIn order to ensure the quick development and proper functioning of the common computer system, the cost of its development should be financed by the general budget of the European Communities under Article 46(1) of the basic Regulation, and the costs of the interface with national, regional, and local computer systems should be eligible for a financial contribution from EFF under Article 46 of that Regulation.\n(33)\nIn the light of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (7) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (8), it is necessary to provide, in relation to the information and publicity measures and the audit work under this Regulation, that the Commission and the Member States should prevent any unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, and to specify the purpose for which the Commission and the Member States may process such data.\n(34)\nCommission Regulations (EC) No 2722/2000 of 13 December 2000 establishing the conditions under which the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) may make a contribution towards the eradication of pathological risks in aquaculture (9), (EC) No 908/2000 of 2 May 2000 laying down detailed rules for calculating aid granted by Member States to producer organisations in the fisheries and aquaculture sector (10) and (EC) No 366/2001 of 22 February 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing the measures provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 (11) should be repealed.\n(35)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Fisheries Fund Committee,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 (the basic Regulation) as regards the following:\n(a)\nthe structure and transmission of operational programmes;\n(b)\nfisheries measures;\n(c)\nthe evaluation of operational programmes;\n(d)\ninformation and publicity;\n(e)\nfinancial engineering instruments;\n(f)\nmanagement, monitoring and control;\n(g)\nirregularities;\n(h)\nelectronic exchange of data;\n(i)\npersonal data.\nArticle 2\nSpecific arrangements for certain operational programmes\nFor operational programmes for which the total eligible public expenditure does not exceed EUR 90 million at 2004 prices, specific arrangements are laid down in Article 28(2) and Articles 51, 52 and 53.\nCHAPTER II\nSTRUCTURE AND TRANSMISSION OF THE OPERATIONAL PROGRAMMES\nArticle 3\nStructure and transmission of the operational programmes\n1.

The necessary preventive and corrective action shall be taken by the responsible authorities.\n4.   Only expenditure falling within the scope of the audit in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be counted towards the amount of expenditure audited, for the purposes of reporting in the tables in point 9 of Part A of Annex VI and point 9 of Part A of Annex VII.\nArticle 43\nSampling\n1.   The sample of operations to be audited each 12-month period shall in the first instance be based on a random statistical sampling method as set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. Additional operations may be selected as a complementary sample as set out in paragraphs 5 and 6.\n2.   The method used to select the sample and to draw conclusions from the results shall take account of internationally accepted audit standards and be documented. Having regard to the amount of expenditure, the number and type of operations and other relevant factors, the audit authority shall determine the appropriate statistical sampling method to apply. The technical parameters of the sample shall be determined in accordance with Annex IV.\n3.   The sample to be audited in each 12-month period shall be selected from those operations for which expenditure has been declared to the Commission for the operational programme during the year preceding the year in which the annual control report, provided for in Article 61(1)(e)(i) of the basic Regulation, is communicated to the Commission. For the first twelve month period, the audit authority may decide to group the operations for which expenditure has been declared to the Commission in 2007 and 2008 as a basis for the selection of the operations to be audited.\n4.   The audit authority shall draw conclusions on the basis of the results of the audits relating to expenditure declared to the Commission during the period referred to in paragraph 3 and communicate them to the Commission in the annual control report. In operational programmes for which the projected error rate is above the materiality level, the audit authority shall analyse its significance and take the necessary actions, including making appropriate recommendations which shall be communicated in the annual control report.\n5.   The audit authority shall regularly review the coverage provided by the random sample, having regard in particular to the need to have sufficient audit assurance for the declarations to be provided at partial and final closure of the operational programme. It shall decide on the basis of its professional judgment whether it is necessary to audit a complementary sample of additional operations in order to take account of specific risk factors identified and to guarantee for the programme sufficient coverage of different types of operation, beneficiaries, intermediate bodies and priority axes.\n6.   The audit authority shall draw conclusions on the basis of the results of the audits of the complementary sample and communicate them to the Commission in the annual control report. Where the number of detected irregularities is high or where systemic irregularities have been detected, the audit authority shall analyse the significance thereof and take the necessary actions including making recommendations which shall be communicated in the annual control report. The results of the audits on the complementary sample shall be analysed separately from those of the random sample. In particular, irregularities detected in the complementary sample shall not be taken into account when the error rate of the random sample is calculated.\nArticle 44\nDocuments presented by the audit authority\n1.   The audit strategy referred to in Article 61(1)(c) of the basic Regulation shall be established in accordance with the model set out in Annex V to this Regulation.

The number of stars is fixed, 12 being the symbol of perfection and unity.\nHeraldic description\nOn an azure field a circle of twelve golden mullets, their points not touching.\nGeometric description\nThe emblem has the form of a blue rectangular flag of which the fly is one and a half times the length of the hoist. Twelve gold stars situated at equal intervals form an invisible circle whose centre is the point of intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle. The radius of the circle is equal to one third of the height of the hoist. Each of the stars has five points which are situated on the circumference of an invisible circle whose radius is equal to 18th of the height of the hoist. All the stars are upright, i.e. with one point vertical and two points in a straight line at right angles to the mast. The circle is arranged so that the stars appear in the position of the hours on the face of a clock. Their number is invariable.\nRegulation colours\nThe emblem is in the following colours:\nPANTONE REFLEX BLUE\n for the surface of the rectangle;\nPANTONE YELLOW\n for the stars.\nFour-colour process\nIf the four-colour process is used, recreate the two standard colours by using the four colours of the four-colour process.\nPANTONE YELLOW\n is obtained by using 100 % ‘Process Yellow’.\nPANTONE REFLEX BLUE\n is obtained by mixing 100 % ‘Process Cyan’ and 80 % ‘Process Magenta’.\nInternet\nIn the web-palette \nPANTONE REFLEX BLUE\n corresponds to colour RGB:0/0/153 (hexadecimal: 000099) and \nPANTONE YELLOW\n to colour RGB:255/204/0 (hexadecimal: FFCC00).\nMonochrome reproduction process\nUsing black, outline the rectangle in black and print the stars in black on white.\nUsing blue (Reflex Blue), use 100 % with the stars reproduced in negative white.\nReproduction on a coloured background\nIf there is no alternative to a coloured background, put a white border around the rectangle, the width of the border being 1/25th of the height of the rectangle.\nANNEX III\nLIST OF DATA TO BE COMMUNICATED ON REQUEST TO THE COMMISSION UNDER ARTICLE 40\nThe data on operations that the Commission may request at any time under Article 40 of this Regulation comprises the following information, without prejudice to other information required for financial management, monitoring, control or evaluation and specified in Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006.\nAt the written request of the Commission, the Member State shall provide the Commission with the appropriate information within 15 working days of receipt of the request or other agreed period for the purpose of carrying out documentary and on-the-spot checks.

24.7.1992, p. 1.\nANNEX IV\nTECHNICAL PARAMETERS FOR RANDOM STATISTICAL SAMPLING UNDER ARTICLE 43 (SAMPLING)\n1.\nA random statistical sampling method allows conclusions to be drawn from the results of audits of the sample on the overall expenditure from which the sample was taken, and hence provides evidence to obtain assurance on the functioning of the management and control systems\n2.\nThe assurance provided on the functioning of the systems is determined by the degree of confidence resulting from the conclusions of the system audits and from the audits of operations in the sample selected by a random statistical sampling method. In order to obtain a high level of assurance, that is, a reduced audit risk, the audit authority shall combine the results of system audits and audits of operations. The audit authority first evaluates the reliability of the systems (high, average or low), taking into account the results of the system audits, so as to determine the technical parameters of the sampling, in particular the confidence level and the expected error rate. Member States may also use the results of the report on the compliance assessment under Article 71(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006. The combined level of assurance obtained from the system audits and the audits of operations must be high. The confidence level used for sampling operations must not be less than 60 % with a maximum materiality level of 2 %. For a system evaluated as having low reliability, the confidence level used for sampling operations must not be below 90 %. The audit authority shall describe in the annual control report the way assurance has been obtained.\n3.\nThe reliability of management and control systems shall be determined using criteria established by the audit authority for systems audits, including a quantified assessment of all key elements of the systems and encompassing the main authorities and intermediate bodies participating in the management and control of the operational programme. A record of the assessments carried out shall be kept in the audit file.\nANNEX V\nMODEL AUDIT STRATEGY AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 61(1)(C) OF REGULATION (EC) No 1198/2006\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nI, the undersigned, … representing the (name of the body designated by Member State), have for the operational programme … (name of the operational programme, CCI code number, period) examined the results of the audit work carried out on this programme by or under the responsibility of the audit authority in accordance with the audit strategy (and have carried out the additional work I judged necessary). The results of the examination and the additional work I have performed are summarised in the attached final control report (which also contains the information required by the annual control reports for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016). I have planned and performed this work with a view to obtaining a reasonable assurance as to whether the payment application for the balance of the Community contribution to the programme is correct and valid and the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular.\n2.   SCOPE OF THE EXAMINATION\nThe examination was carried out in accordance with the audit strategy in respect of this programme and reported in the attached final control report under Article 61(1)(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006.\nEither\nThere were no limitations on the scope of the examination.\nOr\nThe scope of the examination was limited by the following factors:\n(a)\n(b)\n(c) etc.\n(Indicate any limitation on the scope of the examination, for example any systemic problems, weaknesses in the management and control system, lack of supporting documentation, cases under legal proceedings, etc., and estimate the amounts of expenditure and the Community contribution affected. If the audit authority does not consider that the limitations have an impact on the final expenditure declared, this must be stated.)\n3.   IRREGULARITIES AND ERROR RATES\nEither\nThe cases of irregularity and error rates found in the audit work is not such as to preclude an unqualified opinion given the satisfactory way they have been dealt with by the managing authority and the trend in the level of their occurrence over time.\nOr\nThe cases of irregularity and error rates found in the audit work and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority are such as to preclude an unqualified opinion. A list of these cases is provided in the final control report, together with an indication of their possible systemic character and the scale of the problem. The amounts of total declared expenditure and public contribution that could be affected are … respectively. As a consequence, the corresponding Community contribution that could be affected is ….\n4.   OPINION\nEither\n(Unqualified opinion)\nIf there were no limitations on the scope of the examination and the cases of irregularity and error rates and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority do not preclude an unqualified opinion:\nBased on the examination referred to above, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure presents fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid under the operational programme, that the application for payment of the balance of the Community contribution to this programme is valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular.\nOr\n(Qualified opinion)\nIf there were limitations on the scope of the examination and/or cases of irregularity and error rates and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority call for a qualified opinion but do not justify an unfavourable opinion for all the expenditure concerned:\nBased on the examination referred to above, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure presents fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid under the operational programme, that the application for payment of the balance of the Community contribution to this programme is valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular, except with regard to the matters referred to at point 2 above and/or to the observations at point 3 regarding the error rates and cases of irregularity and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority, the impact of which is quantified above. I estimate the impact of these qualifications to be … of the total expenditure declared. The Community contribution affected is thus ….\nOr\n(Adverse opinion)\nIf there were major limitations on the scope of the examination error rates and cases of irregularity and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority are such that no conclusion can be reached on the reliability of the final statement of expenditure without considerable further work:\nBased on the examination referred to above, and in particular in view of the matters referred to at point 2 and/or the error rates and cases of irregularity and the fact that they have not been dealt with satisfactorily by the managing authority as reported at point 3, it is my opinion that that the final statement of expenditure does not present fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid under the operational programme, that, as a consequence, the application for payment of the balance of the Community contribution to this programme is not valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are not legal and regular.\nDate:\nSignature:\n(1)  For changes not indicated in earlier annual control reports.\n(2)  For audits not covered by earlier annual control reports.\n(3)  Examples of such matters include systemic problems, weaknesses in management and control systems, lack of supporting documents, and cases under legal proceedings.\n(4)  Expenditure for complementary sample and expenditure for random sample not in the reference year.\n(5)  Amount of expenditure audited.\n(6)  Percentage of expenditure audited in relation to eligible expenditure declared to the Commission in the reference year.\n(7)  Expenditure for complementary sample and expenditure for random sample not in the reference year.\n(8)  Amount of expenditure audited.\n(9)  Percentage of expenditure audited in relation to eligible expenditure declared to the Commission in the reference year.\nANNEX VIII\nMODEL DECLARATION FOR THE PARTIAL CLOSURE OF THE

that the statement of expenditure on completed operations submitted by the managing authority for the programme … (name of operational programme, CCI code number, period) for the purpose of partial closure of the programme in respect of operations (completed as at …/completed between … and …) presents fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid and that the underlying transactions are

It specifies measures, gives details regarding monitoring and control and establishes financial engineering instruments. Furthermore, this Regulation covers publicity and information and guarantees the protection of personal data.\nACT\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 498/2007 of 26 March 2007 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund [See amending act(s)].\nSUMMARY\nThe mechanisms and implementing rules laid down in this Regulation result from the provisions concerning the basic European Fisheries Fund Regulation (EFF).\nThe purpose of the detailed implementing rules is to facilitate the establishment of operational programmes (Annex I) as well as their examination and the approval of these projects by the Commission. An operational programme must include geographical criteria (analysis of national or local circumstances, description of strengths and weaknesses) and a description of how the projects developed fit in with the priority axes specified in the Regulation. Operational programmes for which public expenditure does not exceed 90 million at 2004 prices are eligible for the specific arrangements provided for in the Regulation. The purpose of these detailed implementing rules is also to assist the examination and approval of these projects by the Commission.\nThe structural measures for fisheries seek to guide and facilitate the restructuring of the sector. This process is necessary to safeguard the future of the sector and promote sustainable fishing. In the light of this, no public aid leading to an increase in fishing effort is permitted.\nPriority axes\nThe implementing rules are established on the basis of the priority axes of the European Fisheries Fund (See Annex I, part A):\nmeasures to adapt the European Union fishing fleet. These include public aid for the permanent or temporary cessation of fishing activities. These measures also determine aid to small-scale coastal fishing and socio-economic compensation for the management of the European fishing fleet;\naquaculture, inland fishing, processing and on-farm retail sale of fishery and aquaculture products. The Regulation defines the scope of aid to aquaculture production. It also proposes measures for productive investments in aquaculture based on species classification, aqua-environmental measures and animal health measures. As regards inland fishing, support may be granted to vessels of less than 12 metres not using towed gear. The Regulation provides for aid for the processing of fish to extract substances harmful to human health (such as dioxins). Aid will also be prioritised to small and micro enterprises;\nmeasures of common interest. These cover collective actions, in particular to create and restructure the plans of producers' organisations, protect flora and fauna, improve services offered by fishing ports, strengthen markets and promote partnerships between scientists and professionals in the fishing sector;\nsustainable development of fisheries areas. The European Union will support local development strategies in order to diversify and strengthen fishing areas in decline. These fishing areas do not necessarily have to coincide with a national administrative area or with zones established by the Structural Funds. The Member States select groups for the implementation of the local development strategy.\nAssessment\nThe Member States are to forward interim evaluations of these programmes by no later than 30 June 2011. The Commission may decide to interrupt the payment deadline where a Member State has not complied with its management, control and spending obligations.\nInformation and publicity\nMember States or the managing authority must carry out information and publicity measures for the public and potential beneficiaries. In addition, the managing authority must ensure that information and publicity measures are aimed at the wider public, for example through the launch of the operational programme, presenting the programme's achievements and by flying the European Union flag (Annex II) for a week from 9 May in front of the managing authority's premises.\nFinancial engineering instruments\nFinancial engineering instruments must be in the form of actions such as socio-economic compensation for fleet management (see list in Annex III) which give rise to repayable investments, particularly to SMEs and micro enterprises, through venture capital funds, guarantee funds and loan funds.\nThe statement of expenditure (Annex IX) must, as regards financial engineering instruments, include the total expenditure paid in establishing or contributing to these instruments. At the partial or final closure of the operational programme the eligible expenditure is the total of any payments for investment in enterprises from each of the financial engineering instruments or any guarantees provided.\nWhen the EFF finances operations comprising financial engineering instruments, including those organised through holding funds, a business plan must be submitted by the co-financing partners or shareholders or by their duly authorised representative. This plan must comply with the conditions laid down in Articles 35, 36 and 37 of this implementing Regulation.\nManagement, monitoring and control\nThe managing authority designated for the programme by the Member State (Annex XII) must ensure that beneficiaries are informed of the specific conditions concerning the products or services to be delivered under the operation, the financing plan, the time-limit for execution and the financial and other information to be kept and communicated. The checks carried out by the managing authority must cover the administrative, financial, technical and physical aspects of the operations. Each amount corresponding to an irregularity is identified by the reference number attributed to that irregularity or by another appropriate method.\nAudits must be carried out on the spot (Annex V) on the basis of documentation and records held by the beneficiary. The audit authority may also carry out random statistical sampling of operations (see Annex IV).\nIrregularities\nIn the event of irregularities Member States must notify the European Commission of the reasons for these. Where an irregularity could have an impact on other Member States, they must also be informed.\nElectronic exchange of data\nThe exchange of data between each Member State and the Commission must be carried out using a computer system established by the Commission which permits the secure exchange of data between the Commission and each Member State.\nThe computer system for data exchange contains information on:\nthe financing plans for operational programmes (model set out in Annex I, part B);\ndeclarations of expenditure and applications for payment (model set out in Annex IX);\nthe annual statement on withdrawn and recovered amounts and pending recoveries (model in Annex X);\nannual forecasts of likely applications for payment (see Annex XIII);\nthe financial section of the annual reports and final implementation reports (model set out in Annex XIV, point 3.3).\nThe computer system must also contain documents and information of common interest such as the operational programme (Annex I, part A), the Commission decision concerning the contribution of the EFF, the annual and final reports on implementation (model Annex XIV), the audit strategy (Annex V) and a description of the management system (Annex XII, part A).\nMember States and the Commission must take all necessary measures to guarantee the protection of personal data.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 498/2007\n30.5.2007\n-\nOJ L 120, 10.5.2007\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU) No 1249/2010\n12.1.2011\n-\nOJ L 341, 23.12.2010\nThe successive amendments and corrections to Regulation (EC) No 498/2007 have been incorporated in to the original document.
