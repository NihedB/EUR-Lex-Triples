{"celex_id": "32014H0478", "reference": "19.7.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 214/38\nCOMMISSION RECOMMENDATION\nof 14 July 2014\non principles for the protection of consumers and players of online gambling services and for the prevention of minors from gambling online\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/478/EU)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 292 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn 2011, the Commission held a public consultation on its ‘Green Paper on online gambling in the internal market’ (1). It identified common objectives of the Member States regarding the regulation of online gambling services and helped to identify the key priority areas for Union action.\n(2)\nIn its Communication ‘Towards a comprehensive European Framework for online gambling’ adopted on 23 October 2012 (2), the Commission proposed a series of actions which seek to respond to the regulatory, societal and technical challenges of online gambling. In particular, the Commission announced that it would present Recommendations on the protection of consumers in the area of online gambling services, including the protection of minors, and on responsible commercial communication of online gambling services. This Recommendation is designed to combine both those subject matters and to improve the protection of consumers, players and to prevent minors from gambling online. This Recommendation aims to ensure that gambling remains a source of entertainment, consumers are provided a safe gambling environment and measures are in place to counter the risk of financial or social harm as well as to set out action needed to prevent minors from gambling online.\n(3)\nIn its Resolution of 10 September 2013 on online gambling in the internal market, the European Parliament (3) called on the Commission to explore the possibility of interoperability between national self-exclusion registers, to raise awareness about the risks of gambling addiction and to consider compulsory third-party identification checks. It also called for online gambling operators to be obliged to provide on the gambling website information on regulatory authorities and warnings to minors and the use of self-restrictions. In addition, the European Parliament called for common principles for responsible commercial communications. It recommended that commercial communications should contain clear warnings as to the consequences of compulsive gambling and the risks of gambling addiction. Commercial communications should be neither excessive nor displayed on content specifically targeted at minors or where there is a higher risk of targeting minors.\n(4)\nThe European Economic and Social Committee has also called on the Commission to intervene to improve consumer protection as regards online gambling, and to protect minors (4).\n(5)\nIn the absence of harmonisation at Union level, Member States are in principle free to set the objectives of their policy on games of chance and to define the level of protection sought for the purpose of protecting the health of consumers. The Court of Justice of the European Union has provided general guidance on the interpretation of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market in the area of (online) gambling, taking into account the specific nature of gambling activities. While Member States may restrict or limit the cross-border supply of online gambling services on the basis of public interest objectives that they seek to protect, they are nonetheless to demonstrate the suitability and necessity of the measure in question. Member States have a duty to demonstrate that the public interest objectives are being pursued in a consistent and systematic manner (5).\n(6)\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union has also established ground rules for commercial communications on gambling services and, in particular, for those provided under monopoly conditions. Advertising by the holder of a public monopoly is to be measured and strictly limited to what is necessary in order to channel consumers towards controlled gaming networks. Such advertising cannot aim to encourage consumers' natural propensity to gamble by stimulating their active participation in it, for example by trivialising gambling, or increasing the attractiveness of gambling by means of enticing advertising messages holding out the prospect of major winnings. In particular, a distinction should be drawn between strategies of the holder of a monopoly that are intended solely to inform potential customers of the existence of products and serve to ensure regular access to games of chance by channelling gamblers into controlled circuits, and those which invite and encourage active participation in such games (6).\n(7)\nProtection of consumers and health are the main public interest objectives of Member States in the context of their national gambling frameworks addressing the prevention of problem gambling and the protection of minors.\n(8)\nThe rules and policies that Member States have introduced to pursue public interest objectives vary considerably. Action at Union level encourages Member States to provide a high level of protection throughout the Union, in particular in light of risks associated with gambling that include the development of a gambling disorder or to other negative personal and social consequences.\n(9)\nThe aim of this Recommendation is to safeguard the health of consumers and players and thus also to minimise eventual economic harm that may result from compulsive or excessive gambling. To that end, it recommends principles for a high level of protection of consumers, players and minors as regards online gambling services. In preparing this Recommendation, the Commission has drawn from good practices in the Member States.\n(10)\nOnline gambling services are widely offered and used. Online gambling is a service activity with annual EU revenues of EUR 10,54 billion in 2012. Technological developments, the increase of internet availability and the convenience of mobile technologies are driving the accessibility and growth of online gambling. However, misinformed choices can be made where information is not sufficiently clear or transparent. In addition, online players look for competing gambling opportunities whenever they perceive a lack of attractive offers.\n(11)\nA wide range of media contributing to exposure to commercial communications relating to gambling exists, for example print media, direct mail, audiovisual media and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorship. This may result in vulnerable groups such as minors being attracted to gambling. At the same time, commercial communication of online gambling services can play an important role in directing consumers to an offer which has been allowed and is supervised, for example by showing the identity of the operator and by carrying correct information about gambling including the risks of problem gambling, as well as appropriate warning messages.\n(12)\nSome individuals who engage in gambling experience problems as a result of their behaviour to a degree which impacts on person or family, others are severely harmed for reasons of pathological gambling. It is estimated that between 0,1-0,8 % of the general adult population suffers from a gambling disorder and an additional 0,1-2,2 % demonstrate potentially problematic gambling involvement. (7) Therefore, a preventive approach is necessary for online gambling services to be offered and promoted in a manner that is socially responsible, in particular to ensure that gambling remains a source of recreational and leisure activity.\n(13)\nMinors are frequently exposed to gambling as they use the internet and mobile applications and media that display gambling advertising as well as outdoor gambling advertising. They also watch or attend sports competitions sponsored by gambling interests or carrying advertising focused on gambling activities. Therefore, this Recommendation is also intended to prevent minors from being harmed or exploited by gambling.\n(14)\nOnline gambling operators established in the Union increasingly hold multiple licences across several Member States which have chosen license-based systems in relation to gambling regulation. They could benefit from a more common approach. Furthermore, the multiplication of compliance requirements can create unnecessary duplication of infrastructure and costs, resulting in an unnecessary administrative burden on regulators.\n(15)\nIt is appropriate to invite Member States to put forward rules providing consumers with information about online gambling. Such rules should prevent the development of gambling related disorders and prevent minors from accessing gambling facilities and discourage consumers from availing of offers which are not allowed and therefore potentially harmful.\n(16)\nWhere appropriate, the principles of this Recommendation should not only be addressed to operators but also to third parties, including so-called ‘affiliates’, who are allowed to promote online gambling services on behalf of the operator.\n(17)\nIt is appropriate to better inform consumers and players about online gambling services which, consistently with Union law, are not allowed according to the law of the Member State where the online gambling service is received and also to act against such services. Within that framework, Member States that do not allow a specific online gambling service should not allow commercial communication for such a service.\n(18)\nThe registration process to open a player account serves the purpose of verifying the identity of the person and enabling the tracking of player behaviour. It is essential that such registration be designed in such a way as to also prevent consumers from dropping out of the registration process and turning to gambling websites that are not regulated.\n(19)\nWhilst the registration process has been introduced differently across the Member States, at times with offline or manual steps in the verification process, Member States should ensure that the identification details can be effectively checked to facilitate the completion of the registration process.\n(20)\nIt is important that player accounts only be made permanent once the identity details provided by the players are validated. Before the account becomes a permanent one, it is desirable that players be allowed to use temporary accounts. In light of their nature, temporary accounts should be for a fixed nominal value and players should not be able to withdraw deposits or winnings.\n(21)\nIn order to protect players and their funds as well as ensure transparency there should be procedures in place to verify player accounts that have not been active for a determined period, and for closing or suspending a player account. Furthermore, where the person is found to be a minor the player account should be cancelled.\n(22)\nIn respect of information alerts, where appropriate, the option of a timer should be visibly available to the player during a gambling session.\n(23)\nIn respect of player support, in addition to the setting of deposit limits, players could be provided with additional protection measures, such as the possibility to set wager or loss limits.\n(24)\nIn order to prevent the development of a gambling disorder, an operator should also be able, in the event of disconcerting changes in gambling behaviour, to direct the player to take time out or to exclude the player. The operator should, in such circumstances, communicate the reasons to the player, and guide the player to assistance or treatment.\n(25)\nOperators are significant sponsors of sports teams and events in Europe. In order to improve accountability of sponsorship by online gambling service providers, requirements should be clear that sponsorship is to be transparent and carried out in a responsible manner. In particular, clearer requirements should be set out to prevent sponsorship by gambling operators from adversely affecting or influencing minors.\n(26)\nIt is also necessary to create awareness about the inherent risks of prevailing gambling websites, such as fraud, that are outside any form of control at the level of the Union.\n(27)\nEffective supervision is necessary for the appropriate protection of public interest objectives. Member States should designate competent authorities, lay down clear guidance for operators and provide easily accessible information for consumers, players and vulnerable groups including minors\n(28)\nCodes of conduct can play an important role in the effective application, and monitoring, of the principles on commercial communication of this Recommendation.\n(29)\nThis Recommendation does not interfere with Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) and Council Directive 93/13/EEC (9).\n(30)\nApplication of the principles laid down in this Recommendation implies the processing of personal data. Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) therefore apply,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION:\nI.   PURPOSE\n1.\nMember States are recommended to achieve a high level of protection for consumers, players and minors through the adoption of principles for online gambling services and for responsible commercial communications of those services, in order to safeguard health and to also minimise the eventual economic harm that may result from compulsive or excessive gambling.\n2.\nThis Recommendation does not interfere with the right of Member States to regulate gambling services.\nII.

It seeks to mobilise EU countries and, through them, other parties such as online gambling operators, to assume their responsibilities and ensure high standards of consumer protection in this rapidly growing sector.\nKEY POINTS\nInformation requirements\nEnsure consumers are aware, and informed, of the risks associated with gambling, both when it comes to gambling websites and to advertising.\nMinors and children\nMinors and children should not be able to gamble online.\nRules are needed in order to minimise their exposure to advertising or promotion of gambling services.\nRegistration process\nTo open an account, players should provide their identity details and age. This information should be checked by operators.\nSupport for players\nTools for players to keep their gambling under control (for example, information on how much they are winning/losing as they play, setting spending limits, etc.).\nEasy access to helplines for advice on their gambling behaviour.\nTraining for employees of online gambling operators to ensure they understand gambling problems and react appropriately in contacts with players.\nAdvertising/promotion\nMust be unambiguous, socially responsible and transparent.\nWHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?\n                     \nThe recommendation was adopted on 14 July 2014.

The Commission is to evaluate its implementation by 19 January 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nOnline gambling in the EU is subject to a variety of national rules (or sometimes no rules at all). Because EU countries face similar challenges and online gambling often has a cross-border dimension, tackling the issue collectively at EU level makes sense. In 2012, the Commission adopted an action plan on online gambling which announced this recommendation.\nFurther information is available on the website of the European Commission's Directorate-General for the Internal Market.\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Towards a comprehensive European framework for online gambling (COM(2012) 596 final of 23.10.2012).\nlast update 03.11.2014", "tags": ["game of chance", "consumer protection", "economic consequence", "child protection", "gambling addiction", "health care", "Internet site"], "subjects": ["Freedom of establishment", "Consumer protection"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32014H0478_p1": {"text": "(8)  directive 2005/29/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council directive 84/450/eec, directive 97/7/ec directive 98/27/ec directive 2002/65/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council and regulation 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) (OJ L 149, 11.6.2005, p. 22).", "triples": [" directive 2005/29/ec,  amending,  directive 84/450/eec", " directive 2005/29/ec,  amending,  directive 97/7/ec", " directive 2005/29/ec,  amending,  directive 98/27/ec", " directive 2005/29/ec,  amending,  directive 2002/65/ec", " directive 2005/29/ec,  amending,  regulation 2006/2004"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
