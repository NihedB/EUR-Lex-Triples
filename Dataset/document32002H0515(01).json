(The persons responsible would be in charge of, for example, public registers, such as the Property Register, or private registers such as those of credit institutions), in each case observing the applicable national laws.(10) The final objectives of such an investigation technique are to ensure that the perpetrators are held accountable, to make good any damage caused and to compensate any victims where appropriate.(11) The investigation technique of \"uncovering\" the assets of any nature belonging to criminals involved in organised drug trafficking will be known as asset investigation, for the period required to establish the assets resulting from the investigation, which may or may not coincide with the conclusion of the drug-trafficking investigation.(12) Assets are defined as the collective property and financial rights owned by a natural or legal person, and asset investigation is defined as the investigation technique enabling information in a series of files and databases (public or private) or other sources to be systematically analysed to identify such individual assets and financial rights and to attribute their ownership to specific natural or legal persons.(13) Instrumentalities, property, proceeds and confiscation are as defined in the 1990 Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime.(14) In the context of the European Union, a number of initiatives are close to completion with the aim of implementing new measures against crime, including drug-related crime, on joint investigation teams and on court orders for the preventive freezing of assets and obtaining evidence,HEREBY RECOMMENDS MEMBER STATES:A. To apply, whenever they consider it necessary, the investigation method in the fight against crime, including crime linked to organised drug trafficking, consisting of investigating on all fronts, right from the beginning, any activities connected with illicit drug trafficking and identifying the organisation's finances and assets.B. To encourage the setting up of permanent or temporary groups specialised in asset investigation, in order to promote greater efficiency in the investigation method described.C. To reinforce or facilitate cooperation between the competent law enforcement, court and tax authorities and persons responsible for the various public or private registers of ownership holding information on assets of any nature, by speeding up the processing of requests for information made by those authorities. (The persons responsible would be in charge of, for example, public registers, such as the Property Register, or private registers such as those of credit institutions), in each case observing the applicable national laws.D. To promote the creation of joint investigative teams between Member States pursuant to the legal instruments of the European Union by applying such methods in cases where the investigation into the criminal organisation involved in drug trafficking affects more than one Member State.E. To invite Europol, in accordance with the Council Recommendation of 30 November 2000 to the Member States in respect of Europol's assistance to joint investigative teams set up by the Member States(2), to support those teams when requested to do so.F. To use the possibilities offered by CEPOL (the European Police College) in devising specific training modules on use of this special investigation technique.Done at Luxemburg, 25 April 2002.For the CouncilThe PresidentM.

Three initial priorities were set: to combat drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and terrorism. The European Union has shown its firm determination to fight all types of crime on several occasions:\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, held in Palermo from 12 to 15 December 2000;\nadoption of the Council Framework Decision on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime;\na number of initiatives by Member States concerning inter alia\nillicit drug trafficking on the high seas, the establishment of a European network of laboratories analysing synthetic drugs and the establishment of joint investigation teams.\nGiven that drug trafficking generates considerable assets for criminals, which are then used to finance other criminal activities, the European Union suggests establishing a technique of \"simultaneous investigation\", whereby investigations are conducted at the same time into illicit drug trafficking and into the assets held by criminal organisations and those acquired during the investigations, the owners of those assets being identified. This method of \"investigating assets\", on the basis of systematic searches in all public or private databases, will make it possible to identify the assets held by criminals (\"assets\" meaning the collective property and financial rights owned by a person).\nThere are several advantages of employing the technique of simultaneous investigation. Once the assets held by criminal organisations have been identified, investigators can:\ndecide to seize property to prevent it being sold or put to other uses;\nidentify the persons involved in trafficking and any other persons benefiting from the proceeds of criminal activities;\nmake good any damage caused and possibly compensate victims.\nBecause drug trafficking activities often extend across borders, the competent law enforcement, court and tax authorities must cooperate in order to identify data on the ownership of assets.\nThe Council therefore invites the Member States to:\napply this method where it proves useful for the purposes of investigations;\npromote the creation of joint investigative teams where investigations affect more than one Member State;\nencourage the setting-up of permanent or temporary groups specialised in asset investigation;\nrequest the support and cooperation of Europol and the European Police College (CEPOL).\n4) implementing measures\n5) follow-up work\nLast updated: 08.09.2005", "tags": ["financing", "fight against crime", "drug traffic", "judicial inquiry", "database", "organised crime"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
