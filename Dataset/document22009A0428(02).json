The conclusion and the implementation of this Agreement come within the framework of the conclusions of the Council of the European Union of 29 April 1997, and are based on the individual merits of Albania.Article 4Albania commits itself to continue and foster cooperation and good neighbourly relations with the other countries of the region including an appropriate level of mutual concessions concerning the movement of persons, goods, capital and services as well as the development of projects of common interest, notably those related to combating organised crime, corruption, money laundering, illegal migration and trafficking, including in particular in human beings and illicit drugs.

In the selection of safeguard measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement. Safeguard measures applied in accordance with Article XIX GATT and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards shall preserve the level/margin of preference granted under this Agreement.(b) Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in this Article, apply forthwith provisional measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.6.

In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement. Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 applies the Community or Albania, as the case may be, shall supply the Stabilisation and Association Council with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties.

Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or Albania, whichever is concerned, may apply forthwith the precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.5. Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately notified to the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their elimination as soon as circumstances permit.Article 40State monopoliesAlbania shall progressively adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that, by the end of the fourth year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States and Albania.

Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.Article 431. The Parties agree that administrative cooperation is essential for the implementation and the control of the preferential treatment granted under this Title and underline their commitment to combat irregularities and fraud in customs and related matters.2. Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud under this Title, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in accordance with this Article.3. For the purpose of this Article a failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia:(a) a repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned;(b) a repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of subsequent verification of the proof of origin;(c) a repeated refusal or undue delay in obtaining authorisation to conduct administrative cooperation missions to verify the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in question.For the purpose of this Article a finding of irregularities or fraud may be made, inter alia, where there is a rapid increase, without satisfactory explanation, in imports of goods exceeding the usual level of production and export capacity of the other Party, that is linked to objective information concerning irregularities or fraud.4. The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:(a) The Party which has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud shall without undue delay notify the Stabilisation and Association Committee of its finding together with the objective information and enter into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee, on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties.(b) Where the Parties have entered into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned. A temporary suspension shall be notified to the Stabilisation and Association Committee without undue delay.(c) Temporary suspensions under this Article shall be limited to the extent necessary to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned.

The notice to importers should indicate for the product concerned that there is a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud.Article 44In case of error by the competent authorities in the proper management of the preferential system of export, and in particular in the application of the provisions of Protocol 4 concerning the definition of the concept of \"originating products\" and methods of administrative cooperation, where this error leads to consequences in terms of import duties, the Party facing such consequences may request the Stabilisation and Association Council to examine the possibilities of adopting all appropriate measures with a view to resolving the situation.Article 45The application of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands.TITLE VMOVEMENT OF WORKERS, ESTABLISHMENT, SUPPLY OF SERVICES, CURRENT PAYMENTS AND MOVEMENT OF CAPITALCHAPTER IMovement of workersArticle 461.

The difference in treatment shall not go beyond what is strictly necessary as a result of such legal or technical differences or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.Article 54In order to make it easier for Community nationals and Albanian nationals to take up and pursue regulated professional activities in Albania and the Community respectively, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine which steps are necessary for the mutual recognition of qualifications. It may take all necessary measures to that end.Article 551. A Community company or an Albanian company established in the territory of Albania or the Community respectively shall be entitled to employ, or have employed by one of its subsidiaries or branches, in accordance with the legislation in force in the host country of establishment, in the territory of Albania and the Community respectively, employees who are nationals of the Member States and of Albania respectively, provided that such employees are key personnel as defined in paragraph 2 and that they are employed exclusively by companies, subsidiaries or branches. The residence and work permits of such employees shall only cover the period of such employment.2. Key personnel of the abovementioned companies, herein referred to as \"organisations\", are \"intra-corporate transferees\" as defined in point (c) in the following categories, provided that the organisation is a legal person and that the persons concerned have been employed by it or have been partners in it (other than as majority shareholders), for at least the year immediately preceding such movement:(a) Persons working in a senior position with an organisation, who primarily direct the management of the establishment, receiving general supervision or direction principally from the board of directors or stockholders of the business or their equivalent including:- directing the establishment or a department or sub-division of the establishment,- supervising and controlling the work of other supervisory, professional or managerial employees,- having the authority personally to recruit and dismiss or recommend recruiting, dismissing or other personnel actions.(b) Persons working within an organisation who possess uncommon knowledge essential to the establishment’s service, research equipment, techniques or management. The assessment of such knowledge may reflect, apart from knowledge specific to the establishment, a high level of qualification referring to a type of work or trade requiring specific technical knowledge, including membership of an accredited profession.(c) An \"intra-corporate transferee\" is defined as a natural person working within an organisation in the territory of a Party, and being temporarily transferred in the context of pursuit of economic activities in the territory of the other Party; the organisation concerned must have its principal place of business in the territory of a Party and the transfer be to an establishment (branch, subsidiary) of that organisation, effectively pursuing like economic activities in the territory of the other Party.3. The entry into and the temporary presence within the territory of the Community or Albania of Albanian and Community nationals respectively shall be permitted, when these representatives of companies are persons working in a senior position, as defined in paragraph 2(a), within a company, and are responsible for the setting-up of a Community subsidiary or branch of an Albanian company or of an Albanian subsidiary or branch of a Community company in a Member State or in Albania respectively, when:- those representatives are not engaged in making direct sales or supplying services, and- the company has its principal place of business outside the Community or Albania, respectively, and has no other representative, office, branch or subsidiary in that Member State or in Albania respectively.Article 56During the first five years following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Albania may, on a transitional basis, introduce measures which derogate from the provisions of this Chapter as regards the establishment of Community companies and nationals of certain industries which:- are undergoing restructuring, or are facing serious difficulties, particularly where these entail serious social problems in Albania, or- face the elimination or a drastic reduction of the total market share held by Albanian companies or nationals in a given sector or industry in Albania, or- are newly emerging industries in Albania.Such measures:(i) shall cease to apply at the latest seven years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement;(ii) shall be reasonable and necessary in order to remedy the situation; and(iii) shall not introduce discrimination concerning the activities of Community companies or nationals already established in Albania at the time of introduction of a given measure, by comparison with Albanian companies or nationals.While devising and applying such measures, Albania shall grant preferential treatment wherever possible to Community companies and nationals, and in no case treatment less favourable than that accorded to companies or nationals from any third country. Prior to the adoption of these measures, Albania shall consult the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall not put them into effect before a one-month period has elapsed following the notification to the Stabilisation and Association Council of the concrete measures to be introduced by Albania, except where the threat of irreparable damage requires the taking of urgent measures, in which case Albania shall consult the Stabilisation and Association Council immediately after their adoption.Upon the expiry of the fifth year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Albania may introduce or maintain such measures only with the authorisation of the Stabilisation and Association Council and under conditions determined by the latter.CHAPTER IIISupply of servicesArticle 571. The Parties undertake in accordance with the following provisions to take the necessary steps to allow progressively the supply of services by Community or Albanian companies or nationals which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.2. In step with the liberalisation process mentioned in paragraph 1, the Parties shall permit the temporary movement of natural persons providing the service or who are employed by the service provider as key personnel as defined in Article 55(2), including natural persons who are representatives of a Community or Albanian company or national and are seeking temporary entry for the purpose of negotiating for the sale of services or entering into agreements to sell services for that service provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves.3.

Account shall be taken of the progress achieved by the Parties in the approximation of their laws.Article 581. The Parties shall not take any measures or actions which render the conditions for the supply of services by Community and Albanian nationals or companies which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended significantly more restrictive as compared to the situation existing on the day preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement.2. If one Party is of the view that measures introduced by the other Party since the date of entry into force of this Agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, such first Party may request the other Party to enter into consultations.Article 59With regard to supply of transport services between the Community and Albania, the following provisions shall apply:1. With regard to inland transport, Protocol 5 lays down the rules applicable to the relationship between the Parties in order to ensure, particularly, unrestricted road transit traffic across Albania and the Community as a whole, the effective application of the principle of non-discrimination and progressive harmonisation of the Albanian transport legislation with that of the Community.2. With regard to international maritime transport, the Parties undertake to apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to the market and traffic on a commercial basis, and to respect international and European obligations in the field of safety, security and environmental standards.The Parties affirm their commitment to a freely competitive environment as an essential feature of international maritime transport.3. In applying the principles of paragraph 2:(a) the Parties shall not introduce cargo-sharing clauses in future bilateral agreements with third countries;(b) the Parties shall abolish, upon the date of entry into force of this Agreement, all unilateral measures and administrative, technical and other obstacles that could have restrictive or discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport;(c) each Party shall grant, inter alia, no less favourable treatment for the ships operated by nationals or companies of the other Party than that accorded to a Party’s own ships with regard to access to ports open to international trade, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, a well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading.4. With a view to ensuring a coordinated development and progressive liberalisation of transport between the Parties adapted to their reciprocal commercial needs, the conditions of mutual market access in air transport shall be dealt with by special Agreements to be negotiated between the Parties.5. Prior to the conclusion of the Agreements referred to in paragraph 4, the Parties shall not take any measures or actions which are more restrictive or discriminatory as compared with the situation existing prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement.6. Albania shall adapt its legislation, including administrative, technical and other rules, to that of the Community existing at any time in the field of air, maritime and inland transport in so far as it serves liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods.7. In step with the common progress in the achievement of the objectives of this Chapter, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine ways of creating the conditions necessary for improving freedom to provide air and inland transport services.CHAPTER IVCurrent payments and movement of capitalArticle 60The Parties undertake to authorise, in freely convertible currency, in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), any payments and transfers on the current account of balance of payments between the Community and Albania.Article 611.

Within seven years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Albania shall progressively adjust its legislation concerning the acquisition of real estate in Albania by nationals of the Member States of the European Union to ensure no less favourable treatment than that accorded to Albanian nationals. Five years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine the modalities for the progressive elimination of such limitations.The Parties shall also ensure, from the fifth year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, free movement of capital relating to portfolio investment and financial loans and credits with maturity shorter than a year.3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Parties shall not introduce any new restrictions on the movement of capital and current payments between residents of the Community and Albania and shall not make the existing arrangements more restrictive.4. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 60 and of this Article, where, in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital between the Community and Albania cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the operation of exchange rate policy or monetary policy in the Community or Albania, the Community and Albania, respectively, may take safeguard measures with regard to movements of capital between the Community and Albania for a period not exceeding one year if such measures are strictly necessary.5.

The provisions of this Title shall be applied subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.2. They shall not apply to activities that in the territory of either Party are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.Article 64For the purpose of this Title, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parties from applying their laws and regulations regarding entry and stay, employment, working conditions, establishment of natural persons and supply of services, provided that, in so doing, they do not apply them in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Party under the terms of a specific provision of this Agreement. This provision shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 63.Article 65Companies which are controlled and exclusively owned jointly by Albanian companies or nationals and Community companies or nationals shall also be covered by the provisions of this Title.Article 661.

The Community or Albania, as the case may be, shall inform the other Party forthwith.3. Any restrictive measures shall not apply to transfers related to investment and in particular to the repatriation of amounts invested or reinvested or any kind of revenues stemming therefrom.Article 68The provisions of this Title shall be progressively adjusted, notably in the light of requirements arising from Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).Article 69The provisions of this Agreement shall not prejudice the application by either Party of any measure necessary to prevent the circumvention of its measures concerning third-country access to its market through the provisions of this Agreement.TITLE VIAPPROXIMATION OF LAWS, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMPETITION RULESArticle 701. The Parties recognise the importance of the approximation of Albania’s existing legislation to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Albania shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation shall be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis.

This approximation shall start on the date of signing of this Agreement, and shall gradually extend to all the elements of the Community acquis referred to in this Agreement by the end of the transitional period as defined in Article 6.3. During the first stage as defined in Article 6, approximation shall focus on fundamental elements of the internal market acquis as well as on other important areas such as competition, intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights, public procurement, standards and certification, financial services, land and maritime transport — with special emphasis on safety and environmental standards as well as social aspects — company law, accounting, consumer protection, data protection, health and safety at work and equal opportunities.

The Parties shall ensure that an operationally independent public body is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(i) and (ii), regarding private and public undertakings and undertakings to which special rights have been granted.4. Albania shall establish an operationally independent authority which is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(iii) within four years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. This authority shall have, inter alia, the powers to authorise State aid schemes and individual aid grants in conformity with paragraph 2, as well as the powers to order the recovery of State aid that has been unlawfully granted.5. Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of State aid, inter alia, by providing to the other Party a regular annual report, or equivalent, following the methodology and the presentation of the Community survey on State aid. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid.6. Albania shall establish a comprehensive inventory of aid schemes instituted before the establishment of the authority referred to in paragraph 4 and shall align such aid schemes with the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 within a period of no more than four years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.7. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii), the Parties recognise that during the first 10 years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by Albania shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Albania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.Within five years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Albania shall submit to the Commission of the European Communities its GDP per capita figures harmonised at NUTS II level. The authority referred to in paragraph 4 and the Commission of the European Communities shall then jointly evaluate the eligibility of the regions of Albania as well as the maximum aid intensities in relation thereto in order to draw up the regional aid map on the basis of the relevant Community guidelines.8. With regard to products referred to in Chapter II of Title IV:- paragraph 1(iii) shall not apply,- any practices contrary to paragraph 1(i) shall be assessed according to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of Articles 36 and 37 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and specific Community instruments adopted on this basis.9. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Stabilisation and Association Council or after 30 working days following referral for such consultation.Nothing in this Article shall prejudice or affect in any way the taking, by either Party, of antidumping or countervailing measures in accordance with the relevant Articles of GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures or related internal legislation.Article 72Public undertakingsBy the end of the third year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Albania shall apply to public undertakings and undertakings to which special and exclusive rights have been granted the principles set out in the Treaty establishing the European Community, with particular reference to Article 86 thereof.Special rights of public undertakings during the transitional period shall not include the possibility of imposing quantitative restrictions or measures having an equivalent effect on imports from the Community into Albania.Article 73Intellectual, industrial and commercial property1.

Albania shall take all the necessary measures in order to guarantee no later than four years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement a level of protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights similar to that existing in the Community, including effective means of enforcing such rights.3. Albania undertakes to accede, within four years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, to the multilateral Conventions on intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights referred to in paragraph 1 of Annex V. The Stabilisation and Association Council may decide to oblige Albania to accede to specific multilateral Conventions in this area.4. If problems in the area of intellectual, industrial and commercial property affecting trading conditions occur, they shall be referred urgently to the Stabilisation and Association Council, at the request of either Party, with a view to reaching mutually satisfactory solutions.Article 74Public contracts1. The Parties consider the opening-up of the award of public contracts on the basis of non-discrimination and reciprocity, in particular in the WTO context, to be a desirable objective.2. Albanian companies, whether established or not in the Community, shall be granted access to contract award procedures in the Community pursuant to Community procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Community companies as from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.The above provisions shall also apply to contracts in the utilities sector once the Government of Albania has adopted the legislation introducing the Community rules in this area.

Albania shall take the necessary measures in order to gradually achieve conformity with Community technical regulations and European standardisation, metrology, accreditation and conformity assessment procedures.2. To this end, the Parties shall start at an early stage:- to promote the use of Community technical regulations, European standards and conformity assessment procedures,- to provide assistance to fostering the development of quality infrastructure: standardisation, metrology, accreditation and conformity assessment,- to promote the participation of Albania in the work of organisations related to standards, conformity assessment, metrology and similar functions (in particular CEN, Cenelec, ETSI, EA, Welmec, Euromet),- where appropriate, to conclude European Conformity Assessment Protocols once the Albanian legislative framework and procedures are sufficiently aligned on those of the Community and appropriate expertise is available.Article 76Consumer protectionThe Parties shall cooperate in order to align the standards of consumer protection in Albania to those of the Community. Effective consumer protection is necessary in order to ensure that the market economy functions properly, and this protection will depend on the development of an administrative infrastructure in order to ensure market surveillance and law enforcement in this field.To that end, and in view of their common interests, the Parties shall encourage and ensure:- a policy of active consumer protection, in accordance with Community law,- the harmonisation of legislation of consumer protection in Albania on that in force in the Community,- effective legal protection for consumers in order to improve the quality of consumer goods and maintain appropriate safety standards,- monitoring of rules by competent authorities and providing access to justice in case of disputes.Article 77Working conditions and equal opportunitiesAlbania shall progressively harmonise its legislation to that of the Community in the fields of working conditions, notably on health and safety at work, and equal opportunities.TITLE VIIJUSTICE, FREEDOM AND SECURITYCHAPTER IIntroductionArticle 78Reinforcement of institutions and rule of lawIn their cooperation on justice and home affairs the Parties shall attach particular importance to the consolidation of the rule of law, and the reinforcement of institutions at all levels in the areas of administration in general and law enforcement and the administration of justice in particular.
