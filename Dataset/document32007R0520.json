In the framework of its wider international obligations, the Community participates in efforts made in international waters to conserve fish stocks.\n(2)\nPursuant to Decision 86/238/EEC (2) the Community has been a Contracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, hereinafter ‘the ICCAT Convention’, since 14 November 1997.\n(3)\nThe ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation on the conservation and management of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas through the setting up of an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, hereinafter the ‘ICCAT’, and the adoption of recommendations on conservation and management in the Convention area which become binding on the Contracting Parties.\n(4)\nICCAT has recommended a number of technical measures for certain stocks of highly migratory species in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, specifying inter alia authorised sizes and weights of fish, and restrictions on fishing within certain areas and time periods, with certain gears, and on capacity. These recommendations are binding on the Community and should therefore be implemented.\n(5)\nThe Community has by Decision 95/399/EC (3) approved the Agreement for the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. The Agreement provides an appropriate framework for closer international cooperation and the rational use of tunas and related species in the Indian Ocean by setting up the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, hereinafter the ‘IOTC’, and adopting recommendations on conservation and management in the IOTC area which become binding on the Contracting Parties.\n(6)\nThe IOTC has adopted a recommendation laying down technical measures for certain stocks of highly migratory species in the Indian Ocean and in particular the limiting of capacity. That recommendation is binding on the Community and should therefore be implemented.\n(7)\nThe Community has by Decision 2005/938/EC (4) approved the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme. It should therefore apply the provisions laid down in that Agreement.\n(8)\nThe objectives of the Agreement include a progressive reduction of incidental dolphin mortalities in the tuna purseseine fishery in the Eastern Pacific Ocean to levels approaching zero, by setting annual limits, and the long-term sustainability of the tuna stocks in the Agreement Area.\n(9)\nThe Community has fishing interests in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and has participated in the procedure for the adoption of the Convention for the strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, hereinafter the ‘Antigua Convention’. By Decision 2005/26/EC (5) it signed the Antigua Convention and launched the procedure for becoming a party to it. Pending the entry into force of the Antigua Convention, the Community, as a cooperating non-contracting party to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, hereinafter the ‘IATTC’, has decided to apply the technical measures adopted by the IATTC. These measures should therefore be incorporated in Community law.\n(10)\nPursuant to Decision 2005/75/EC (6) and with effect from 25 January 2005 the Community is a Contracting Party to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, hereinafter the ‘WCPFC Convention’.\n(11)\nThe WCPFC Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation with a view to ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable exploitation of highly migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean through the setting up of a Fisheries Commission for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC).\n(12)\nThe Community should therefore apply the provisions laid down in the Convention and the technical measures adopted by the WCPFC.\n(13)\nThe technical measures adopted by these regional fisheries organisations have been incorporated into Council Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 of 14 May 2001 laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species (7).\n(14)\nThe adoption of new technical measures by these organisations and the updating of those in force since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 require the repeal of that Regulation and its replacement by this Regulation.\n(15)\nThe limits on capacity must be determined in accordance with Article 20 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy (8).\n(16)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9),\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nObject\nThis Regulation lays down technical conservation measures applicable to the capture and landing of certain stocks of highly migratory species as referred to in Annex I and to the capture of by-catches.\nArticle 2\nScope\nWithout prejudice to Article 9, this Regulation shall apply to vessels flying the flag of a Member State and registered in the Community, hereinafter ‘Community fishing vessels’.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n1.\n‘Highly migratory species’ means the species listed in Annex I.\n2.\n‘Tunas and related species covered by ICCAT’ means the species listed in Annex II.\n3.\n‘Dolphin mortality limit’ means the limit defined in Article V of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (10).\n4.\n‘Leisure fisheries’ means fishing activities exploiting living aquatic resources for recreation or sport.\n5.\n‘Encircling nets’ means nets which catch fish by surrounding them both from the sides and from below; they may or may not be equipped with a purse line.\n6.\n‘Purse seines’ means any encircling net the bottom of which is drawn together by means of a purse line at the bottom of the net, which passes through a series of rings along the groundrope, enabling the net to be pursed and closed.
