That Regulation provides for the means of achieving that objective and other objectives in the field of civil aviation safety.\n(2)\nPilots involved in the operation of certain aircraft, as well as flight simulation training devices, persons and organisations involved in training, testing or checking of those pilots, have to comply with the relevant essential requirements set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. According to that Regulation pilots as well as persons and organisations involved in their training should be certified once they have been found to comply with essential requirements.\n(3)\nSimilarly, pilots should be issued with a medical certificate and aero-medical examiners, responsible for assessing the medical fitness of pilots, should be certified once they have been found to comply with the relevant essential requirements. However, Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 envisages the possibility of general medical practitioners to act as aero-medical examiners under certain conditions and if permitted under national law.\n(4)\nCabin crew involved in the operation of certain aircraft have to comply with the relevant essential requirements set out in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. According to that Regulation, cabin crew should be periodically assessed for medical fitness to safely exercise their assigned safety duties. Compliance must be shown by an appropriate assessment based on aero-medical best practice.\n(5)\nRegulation (EC) No 216/2008 requires the Commission to adopt the necessary implementing rules for establishing the conditions for certifying pilots as well as persons involved in their training, testing or checking, for the attestation of cabin crew members and for the assessment of their medical fitness.\n(6)\nThe requirements and procedures for the conversion of national pilot licences and national flight engineer licences into pilot licences should be laid down, to ensure that they are allowed to perform their activities under harmonised conditions; flight test qualifications should also be converted in accordance with this Regulation.\n(7)\nIt should be possible for Member States to accept licences issued by third countries where a level of safety equivalent to that specified by Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 can be guaranteed; Conditions for the acceptance of licences issued by third countries should be laid down.\n(8)\nIn order to ensure that training commenced before the application of this Regulation may be taken into account for the purposes of obtaining pilots’ licences, the conditions for recognising training already completed should be laid down; the conditions for recognising military licences should also be laid down.\n(9)\nIt is necessary to provide sufficient time for the aeronautical industry and Member State administrations to adapt to the new regulatory framework, to allow Member States the time to issue specific types of pilot licences and medical certificates not covered by the ‘JAR’, and to recognise under certain conditions the validity of licences and certificates issued, as well as aero-medical assessment performed, before this Regulation applies.\n(10)\nCouncil Directive 91/670/EEC of 16 December 1991 on mutual acceptance of personnel licences for the exercise of functions in civil aviation (2) is repealed in accordance with Article 69(2) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. The measures adopted by this Regulation are to be regarded as the corresponding measures.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition and a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union, implementing measures should reflect the state of the art, including best practices, and scientific and technical progress in the field of pilot training and aircrew aero-medical fitness. Accordingly, technical requirements and administrative procedures agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Joint Aviation Authorities until 30 June 2009 as well as existing legislation pertaining to a specific national environment, should be considered.\n(12)\nThe Agency prepared draft implementing rules and submitted them as an opinion to the Commission in accordance with Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(13)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down detailed rules for:\n(1)\ndifferent ratings for pilots’ licences, the conditions for issuing, maintaining, amending, limiting, suspending or revoking licences, the privileges and responsibilities of the holders of licences, the conditions for the conversion of existing national pilots’ licences and of national flight engineers’ licences into pilots’ licences, as well as the conditions for the acceptance of licences from third countries;\n(2)\nthe certification of persons responsible for providing flight training or flight simulation training and for assessing pilots’ skills;\n(3)\ndifferent medical certificates for pilots, the conditions for issuing, maintaining, amending, limiting, suspending or revoking medical certificates, the privileges and responsibilities of the holders of medical certificates as well as the conditions for the conversion of national medical certificates into commonly recognised medical certificates;\n(4)\nthe certification of aero-medical examiners, as well as the conditions under which general medical practitioners may act as aero-medical examiners;\n(5)\nthe periodical aero-medical assessment of cabin crew members, as well as the qualification of persons responsible for this assessment.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘Part-FCL licence’ means a flight crew licence which complies with the requirements of Annex I;\n(2)\n‘JAR’ means joint aviation requirements adopted by the Joint Aviation Authorities as applicable on 30 June 2009;\n(3)\n‘Light aircraft pilot licence (LAPL)’ means the leisure pilot licence referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008;\n(4)\n‘JAR-compliant licence’ means the pilot licence and attached ratings, certificates, authorisations and/or qualifications, issued or recognised, in accordance with the national legislation reflecting JAR and procedures, by a Member State having implemented the relevant JAR and having being recommended for mutual recognition within the Joint Aviation Authorities’ system in relation to such JAR;\n(5)\n‘Non-JAR-compliant licence’ means the pilot licence issued or recognised by a Member State in accordance with national legislation and not having been recommended for mutual recognition in relation to the relevant JAR;\n(6)\n‘Credit’ means the recognition of prior experience or qualifications;\n(7)\n‘Credit report’ means a report on the basis of which prior experience or qualifications may be recognised;\n(8)\n‘Conversion report’ means a report on the basis of which a licence may be converted into a Part-FCL licence;\n(9)\n‘JAR-compliant pilots’ medical certificate and aero-medical examiners’ certificate’ means the certificate issued or recognised, in accordance with the national legislation reflecting JAR and procedures, by a Member State having implemented the relevant JAR and having been recommended for mutual recognition within the Joint Aviation Authorities’ system in relation to such JAR;\n(10)\n‘Non-JAR-compliant pilots’ medical certificate and aero-medical examiners’ certificate’ means the certificate issued or recognised by a Member State in accordance with national legislation and not having been recommended for mutual recognition in relation to the relevant JAR.\nArticle 3\nPilot licensing and medical certification\nWithout prejudice to Article 7, pilots of aircraft referred to in Article 4(1)(b) and (c) and Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 shall comply with the technical requirements and administrative procedures laid down in Annex I and Annex IV to this Regulation.\nArticle 4\nExisting national pilots’ licences\n1.

Vocabulary is idiomatic, nuanced and sensitive to register.\nAble to speak at length with a natural, effortless flow. Varies speech flow for stylistic effect, e.g. to emphasise a point.\nUses appropriate discourse markers and connectors spontaneously.\nComprehension is consistently accurate in nearly all contexts and includes comprehension of linguistic and cultural subtleties.\nInteracts with ease in nearly all situations. Is sensitive to verbal and non-verbal cues, and responds to them appropriately.\nExtended\n(Level 5)\nPronunciation, stress, rhythm, and intonation, though influenced by the first language or regional variation, rarely interfere with ease of understanding.\nBasic grammatical structures and sentence patterns are consistently well controlled. Complex structures are attempted but with errors which sometimes interfere with meaning.\nVocabulary range and accuracy are sufficient to communicate effectively on common, concrete, and work-related topics. Paraphrases consistently and successfully. Vocabulary is sometimes idiomatic.\nAble to speak at length with relative ease on familiar topics, but may not vary speech flow as a stylistic device. Can make use of appropriate discourse markers or connectors.\nComprehension is accurate on common, concrete, and work-related topics and mostly accurate when the speaker is confronted with a linguistic or situational complication or an unexpected turn of events.\nIs able to comprehend a range of speech varieties (dialect and/or accent) or registers.\nResponses are immediate, appropriate, and informative. Manages the speaker/listener relationship effectively.\nOperational\n(Level 4)\nPronunciation, stress, rhythm, and intonation are influenced by the first language or regional variation but only sometimes interfere with ease of understanding.\nBasic grammatical structures and sentence patterns are used creatively and are usually well controlled. Errors may occur, particularly in unusual or unexpected circumstances, but rarely interfere with meaning.\nVocabulary range and accuracy are usually sufficient to communicate effectively on common, concrete, and work-related topics.\nCan often paraphrase successfully when lacking vocabulary particularly in unusual or unexpected circumstances.\nProduces stretches of language at an appropriate tempo.\nThere may be occasional loss of fluency on transition from rehearsed or formulaic speech to spontaneous interaction, but this does not prevent effective communication. Can make limited use of discourse markers and connectors. Fillers are not distracting.\nComprehension is mostly accurate on common, concrete, and work-related topics when the accent or variety used is sufficiently intelligible for an international community of users.\nWhen the speaker is confronted with a linguistic or situational complication or an unexpected turn of events, comprehension may be slower or require clarification strategies.\nResponses are usually immediate, appropriate, and informative.\nInitiates and maintains exchanges even when dealing with an unexpected turn of events.

Failure to achieve a pass in all sections of the test in two attempts will require further training.\n3.   There is no limit to the number of skill tests that may be attempted.\nCONTENT OF THE TRAINING, SKILL TEST/PROFICIENCY CHECK\n4.   Unless otherwise determined in the operational suitability data established in accordance with Part-21, the syllabus of flight instruction shall comply with this Appendix. The syllabus may be reduced to give credit for previous experience on similar aircraft types, as determined in the operational suitability data established in accordance with Part-21.\n5.   Except in the case of skill tests for the issue of an ATPL, when so defined in the operational suitability data established in accordance with Part-21 for the specific type, credit may be given for skill test items common to other types or variants where the pilot is qualified.\nCONDUCT OF THE TEST/CHECK\n6.   The examiner may choose between different skill test or proficiency check scenarios containing simulated relevant operations developed and approved by the competent authority. Full flight simulators and other training devices, when available, shall be used, as established in this Part.\n7.   During the proficiency check, the examiner shall verify that the holder of the class or type rating maintains an adequate level of theoretical knowledge.\n8.   Should the applicant choose to terminate a skill test for reasons considered inadequate by the examiner, the applicant shall retake the entire skill test. If the test is terminated for reasons considered adequate by the examiner, only those sections not completed shall be tested in a further flight.\n9.   At the discretion of the examiner, any manoeuvre or procedure of the test may be repeated once by the applicant. The examiner may stop the test at any stage if it is considered that the applicant’s demonstration of flying skill requires a complete re-test.\n10.   An applicant shall be required to fly the aircraft from a position where the PIC or co-pilot functions, as relevant, can be performed and to carry out the test as if there is no other crew member if taking the test/check under single-pilot conditions. Responsibility for the flight shall be allocated in accordance with national regulations.\n11.   During pre-flight preparation for the test the applicant is required to determine power settings and speeds. The applicant shall indicate to the examiner the checks and duties carried out, including the identification of radio facilities. Checks shall be completed in accordance with the check-list for the aircraft on which the test is being taken and, if applicable, with the MCC concept. Performance data for take-off, approach and landing shall be calculated by the applicant in compliance with the operations manual or flight manual for the aircraft used. Decision heights/altitude, minimum descent heights/altitudes and missed approach point shall be agreed upon with the examiner.\n12.   The examiner shall take no part in the operation of the aircraft except where intervention is necessary in the interests of safety or to avoid unacceptable delay to other traffic.\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SKILL TEST/PROFICIENCY CHECK FOR MULTI-PILOT AIRCRAFT TYPE RATINGS, FOR SINGLE-PILOT AEROPLANE TYPE RATINGS, WHEN OPERATED IN MULTI-PILOT OPERATIONS, FOR MPL AND ATPL\n13.   The skill test for a multi-pilot aircraft or a single-pilot aeroplane when operated in multi-pilot operations shall be performed in a multi-crew environment. Another applicant or another type rated qualified pilot may function as second pilot. If an aircraft is used, the second pilot shall be the examiner or an instructor.\n14.   The applicant shall operate as PF during all sections of the skill test, except for abnormal and emergency procedures, which may be conducted as PF or PNF in accordance with MCC. The applicant for the initial issue of a multi-pilot aircraft type rating or ATPL shall also demonstrate the ability to act as PNF. The applicant may choose either the left hand or the right hand seat for the skill test if all items can be executed from the selected seat.\n15.   The following matters shall be specifically checked by the examiner for applicants for the ATPL or a type rating for multi-pilot aircraft or for multi-pilot operations in a single-pilot aeroplane extending to the duties of a PIC, irrespective of whether the applicant acts as PF or PNF:\n(a)\nmanagement of crew cooperation;\n(b)\nmaintaining a general survey of the aircraft operation by appropriate supervision; and\n(c)\nsetting priorities and making decisions in accordance with safety aspects and relevant rules and regulations appropriate to the operational situation, including emergencies.\n16.   The test/check should be accomplished under IFR, if the IR rating is included, and as far as possible be accomplished in a simulated commercial air transport environment. An essential element to be checked is the ability to plan and conduct the flight from routine briefing material.\n17.   When the type rating course has included less than 2 hours flight training on the aircraft, the skill test may be conducted in an FFS and may be completed before the flight training on the aircraft. In that case, a certificate of completion of the type rating course including the flight training on the aircraft shall be forwarded to the competent authority before the new type rating is entered in the applicant’s licence.\nB.   Specific requirements for the aeroplane category\nPASS MARKS\n1.   In the case of single-pilot aeroplanes, with the exception of for single-pilot high performance complex aeroplanes, the applicant shall pass all sections of the skill test or proficiency check. If any item in a section is failed, that section is failed. Failure in more than one section will require the applicant to take the entire test or check again. Any applicant failing only one section shall take the failed section again. Failure in any section of the re-test or re-check including those sections that have been passed at a previous attempt will require the applicant to take the entire test or check again. For single-pilot multi-engine aeroplanes, section 6 of the relevant test or check, addressing asymmetric flight, shall be passed.\n2.   In the case of multi-pilot and single-pilot high performance complex aeroplanes, the applicant shall pass all sections of the skill test or proficiency check. Failure of more than five items will require the applicant to take the entire test or check again. Any applicant failing five or less items shall take the failed items again. Failure in any item on the re-test or re-check including those items that have been passed at a previous attempt will require the applicant to take the entire check or test again. Section 6 is not part of the ATPL or MPL skill test. If the applicant only fails or does not take section 6, the type rating will be issued without CAT II or CAT III privileges. To extend the type rating privileges to CAT II or CAT III, the applicant shall pass the section 6 on the appropriate type of aircraft.\nFLIGHT TEST TOLERANCE\n3.   The applicant shall demonstrate the ability to:\n(a)\noperate the aeroplane within its limitations;\n(b)\ncomplete all manoeuvres with smoothness and accuracy;\n(c)\nexercise good judgement and airmanship;\n(d)\napply aeronautical knowledge;\n(e)\nmaintain control of the aeroplane at all times in such a manner that the successful outcome of a procedure or manoeuvre is always assured;\n(f)\nunderstand and apply crew coordination and incapacitation procedures, if applicable; and\n(g)\ncommunicate effectively with the other crew members, if applicable.\n4.   The following limits shall apply, corrected to make allowance for turbulent conditions and the handling qualities and performance of the aeroplane used:\nHeight\nGenerally\n± 100 feet\nStarting a go-around at decision height\n+ 50 feet/– 0 feet\nMinimum descent height/altitude\n+ 50 feet/– 0 feet\nTracking\non radio aids\n± 5°\nPrecision approach\nhalf scale deflection, azimuth and glide path\nHeading\nall engines operating\n± 5°\nwith simulated engine failure\n± 10°\nSpeed\nall engines operating\n± 5 knots\nwith simulated engine failure\n+ 10 knots/– 5 knots\nCONTENT OF THE TRAINING/SKILL TEST/PROFICIENCY CHECK\n5.
