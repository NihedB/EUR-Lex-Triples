{"celex_id": "32008R0767", "reference": "13.8.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 218/60\nREGULATION (EC) No 767/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 9 July 2008\nconcerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(b)(ii) and Article 66 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nBuilding upon the conclusions of the Council of 20 September 2001, and the conclusions of the European Council in Laeken in December 2001, in Seville in June 2002, in Thessaloniki in June 2003 and in Brussels in March 2004, the establishment of the Visa Information System (VIS) represents one of the key initiatives within the policies of the European Union aimed at establishing an area of freedom, security and justice.\n(2)\nCouncil Decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) (2) established the VIS as a system for the exchange of visa data between Member States.\n(3)\nIt is now necessary to define the purpose, the functionalities and responsibilities for the VIS, and to establish the conditions and procedures for the exchange of visa data between Member States to facilitate the examination of visa applications and related decisions, taking into account the orientations for the development of the VIS adopted by the Council on 19 February 2004 and to give the Commission the mandate to set up the VIS.\n(4)\nFor a transitional period, the Commission should be responsible for the operational management of the central VIS, of the national interfaces and of certain aspects of the communication infrastructure between the central VIS and the national interfaces.\nIn the long term, and following an impact assessment containing a substantive analysis of alternatives from a financial, operational and organisational perspective, and legislative proposals from the Commission, a permanent Management Authority with responsibility for these tasks should be established. The transitional period should last for no more than five years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(5)\nThe VIS should have the purpose of improving the implementation of the common visa policy, consular cooperation and consultation between central visa authorities by facilitating the exchange of data between Member States on applications and on the decisions relating thereto, in order to facilitate the visa application procedure, to prevent ‘visa shopping’, to facilitate the fight against fraud and to facilitate checks at external border crossing points and within the territory of the Member States. The VIS should also assist in the identification of any person who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States, and facilitate the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanism for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (3), and contribute to the prevention of threats to the internal security of any of the Member States.\n(6)\nThis Regulation is based on the acquis of the common visa policy. The data to be processed by the VIS should be determined on the basis of the data provided by the common form for visa applications as introduced by Council Decision 2002/354/EC of 25 April 2002 on the adaptation of Part III of, and the creation of an Annex 16 to, the Common Consular Instructions (4), and the information on the visa sticker provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas (5).\n(7)\nThe VIS should be connected to the national systems of the Member States to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to process data on visa applications and on visas issued, refused, annulled, revoked or extended.\n(8)\nThe conditions and procedures for entering, amending, deleting and consulting the data in the VIS should take into account the procedures laid down in the Common Consular Instructions on visas for the diplomatic missions and consular posts (6) (the Common Consular Instructions).\n(9)\nThe technical functionalities of the network for consulting the central visa authorities as laid down in Article 17(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (7) (the Schengen Convention) should be integrated into the VIS.\n(10)\nTo ensure reliable verification and identification of visa applicants, it is necessary to process biometric data in the VIS.\n(11)\nIt is necessary to define the competent authorities of the Member States, the duly authorised staff of which are to have access to enter, amend, delete or consult data for the specific purposes of the VIS in accordance with this Regulation to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks.\n(12)\nAny processing of VIS data should be proportionate to the objectives pursued and necessary for the performance of the tasks of the competent authorities. When using the VIS, the competent authorities should ensure that the human dignity and integrity of the persons whose data are requested are respected and should not discriminate against persons on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.\n(13)\nThis Regulation should be complemented by a separate legal instrument adopted under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union concerning access for the consultation of the VIS by authorities responsible for internal security.\n(14)\nThe personal data stored in the VIS should be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the VIS. It is appropriate to keep the data for a maximum period of five years, in order to enable data on previous applications to be taken into account for the assessment of visa applications, including the applicants' good faith, and for the documentation of illegal immigrants who may, at some stage, have applied for a visa. A shorter period would not be sufficient for those purposes. The data should be deleted after a period of five years, unless there are grounds to delete them earlier.\n(15)\nPrecise rules should be laid down as regards the responsibilities for the establishment and operation of the VIS, and the responsibilities of the Member States for the national systems and the access to data by the national authorities.\n(16)\nRules on the liability of the Member States in respect of damage arising from any breach of this Regulation should be laid down. The liability of the Commission in respect of such damage is governed by the second paragraph of Article 288 of the Treaty.\n(17)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (8) applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States in application of this Regulation. However, certain points should be clarified in respect of the responsibility for the processing of data, of safeguarding the rights of the data subjects and of the supervision on data protection.\n(18)\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (9) applies to the activities of the Community institutions or bodies when carrying out their tasks as responsible for the operational management of the VIS. However, certain points should be clarified in respect of the responsibility for the processing of data and of the supervision of data protection.\n(19)\nThe National Supervisory Authorities established in accordance with Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC should monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, while the European Data Protection Supervisor as established by Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should monitor the activities of the Community institutions and bodies in relation to the processing of personal data, taking into account the limited tasks of the Community institutions and bodies with regard to the data themselves.\n(20)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor and the National Supervisory Authorities should cooperate actively with each other.\n(21)\nThe effective monitoring of the application of this Regulation requires evaluation at regular intervals.\n(22)\nThe Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented.\n(23)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (10).\n(24)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(25)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common Visa Information System and the creation of common obligations, conditions and procedures for the exchange of visa data between Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(26)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Regulation and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(27)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (11), which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (12) of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(28)\nAn arrangement should be made to allow representatives of Iceland and Norway to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Agreement in the form of Exchange of Letters between the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers (13), annexed to the Agreement referred to in Recital 27.\n(29)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (14), and subsequent Council Decision 2004/926/EC of 22 December 2004 on the putting into effect of parts of the Schengen acquis by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (15). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(30)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (16). Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(31)\nAs regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of Council Decision 2004/860/EC (17).\n(32)\nAn arrangement should be made to allow representatives of Switzerland to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Exchange of Letters between the Community and Switzerland, annexed to the Agreement referred to in Recital 31.\n(33)\nThis Regulation constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\nThis Regulation defines the purpose of, the functionalities of and the responsibilities for the Visa Information System (VIS), as established by Article 1 of Decision 2004/512/EC.

This summary reflects the content of the regulation, as amended, where these amendments have actually entered into force.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the VIS, originally set up under Decision 2004/512/EC, is to improve the implementation of the common visa policy, consular cooperation and consultations between the central visa authorities by:\nfacilitating the visa application procedure;\npreventing ‘visa shopping’;\nfacilitating the fight against fraud;\nfacilitating checks at external border crossing points and in the national territories;\nassisting in identifying persons who do not meet the requirements for entering, staying or residing in the national territories;\nfacilitating the application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, which determines the Member State responsible for examining a non EU-country national’s asylum application (see summary);\ncontributing to the prevention of threats to Member States’ internal security.\nIn specific cases, the national authorities and Europol may request access to data entered into the VIS for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating terrorist and criminal offences.\nThe following categories of data are recorded in the VIS:\nalphanumeric data on the applicant and on the visas requested, issued, refused, annulled, revoked or extended;\nphotographs;\nfingerprint data;\nlinks to previous visa applications and to the application files of persons travelling together.\nCategories of data recorded in the common identity repository\nThe following data are recorded in the common identity repository (CIR):\nfamily name, given names, date of birth, sex;\nsurname at birth (former surname(s)), place and country of birth, current nationality and nationality at birth;\ntravel document information, including: type and number,issuing country,issuing authority,date of expiry of validity.\nAccess to the VIS\nOnly duly authorised staff of the visa authorities may enter, amend or delete VIS data;\nOnly duly authorised staff of the visa authorities and authorities who carry out checks at the external border crossing points, immigration checks and asylum may consult VIS data.\nAuthorities with access to VIS must ensure that: its use is limited to that which is necessary, appropriate and proportionate for carrying out their tasks;in using VIS, visa applicants and holders are not discriminated against and that their human dignity and integrity are respected.\nData entry by the visa authorities\nThe visa authority creates the application file, where an application is admissible according to the Visa Code, laid down in amending Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (see summary). It enters the data specified in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 into the VIS.\nThe visa authority adds other data where a decision has been taken to issue a visa, for example: the issuing authority;the type of visa;the number of the visa sticker;the territory in which the visa holder is entitled to travel;the start and end dates of the visa’s validity;the number of entries authorised by the visa in the territory.\nThe grounds must be specified where a decision has been taken to: refuse, annul or revoke a visa; orextend its period of validity.\nUse of the VIS\nThe VIS is used:\nby competent visa authorities examining applications and the decisions relating to those applications;\nbetween central visa authorities for consultation and requests for documents;\nby competent visa authorities for the purposes of reporting and statistics (without identifying individual applicants).\nAccess to VIS data by other authorities\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 introducing the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) (see summary) resulted in more efficient and rapid border checks by means of a secure communication channel between the central system of the EES and the central VIS. Direct consultation between the EES and the VIS is only possible where both Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 so provide.\nVisa authorities using the VIS may consult the EES from the VIS: when examining and deciding on visa applications;in order to retrieve and export the visa-related data directly from the VIS into the EES in the event that a visa is annulled, revoked or extended.\nBorder authorities using the EES may consult the VIS from the EES in order to: retrieve the visa-related data directly from the VIS and import them into the EES;verify the authenticity and validity of the visa;check whether visa-exempt non-EU nationals for whom an individual file is not recorded in the EES were previously registered in the VIS;verify, where the identity of a visa holder is verified using fingerprints, the identity of a visa holder with fingerprints against the VIS.\nAuthorities competent for carrying out checks within the territory of the Member States may search data with the sole purpose of verifying the identity of the visa holder and/or the authenticity of the visa and/or whether the conditions for entry to, stay or residence are fulfilled.\nNational authorities responsible for asylum may have access to data for the sole purposes of: determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application; andexamining an application for asylum.\nOperation of the VIS\nSince June 2018, the European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems (eu-LISA) has been responsible for the operational management of the Central VIS and the national interfaces which connect to Member States’ national systems.\nOperational management of the VIS consists of all the tasks necessary to keep the VIS functioning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These include the maintenance work and technical developments necessary to ensure that the system functions at a satisfactory level of operational quality.\nEach EU Member State is responsible for: developing, organising, managing, operating and maintaining its national system;ensuring the security of data before and during transmission to its national interface and, to this end, adopting a security plan;managing access by duly authorised staff of its competent national authorities to the VIS;bearing the costs incurred by its national system.\nData in the VIS cannot be communicated to non-EU countries or international organisations unless it is vital for attesting a non-EU national’s identity in individual cases.\nData security, liability and protection\nThe Member State which has entered the data in the VIS must ensure its security before and during transmission to the national interface. Each country must ensure the security of data received from the VIS and adopt a security plan in relation to its national system.\nAny person who, or country which, has suffered damage as a result of an unlawful processing operation or any act incompatible with Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 is entitled to receive compensation from the country responsible for the damage suffered.\nEach country and the eu-LISA must keep records of all data processing operations within the VIS, as well as records of the staff duly authorised to enter or retrieve the data.\nEach Member State must require a national supervisory authority, established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (see summary), to monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by that country. The European Data Protection Supervisor monitors the activities of eu-LISA.\nApplication\nAs a Schengen instrument, this regulation applies to Member States with the exception of Ireland. Denmark has decided to implement the regulation, as have Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.\nRecent amendments to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008\nWith a view to addressing security challenges as well as changing migration patterns, efforts are under way to make the EU’s various information systems interoperable. Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 has therefore been amended several times to take this work into account — although these changes will not apply until a date yet to be decided, which will not be before 2023. These amendments are the following.\nRegulation (EU) 2019/817 concerning interoperability between EU information systems in the field of justice, freedom and security (see summary).\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1134 amending Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, as well as two closely related texts, the Visa Code (Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 — see summary) and the Schengen Borders Code (Regulation (EU) 2016/399 — see summary). Among other things, it strengthens the background checks undertaken before a decision is taken on granting a visa.\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1152 amending Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 in relation to the VIS’s interoperability with the European Travel Information and Authorisation System set up under Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 (see summary).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\nApplication of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 was to be determined by the European Commission in accordance with its Article 48(3). The VIS came into operation on 11 October 2011.\nThe regulation’s Articles 26, 27, 32, 45, 48(1), (2) and (4) and Article 49 have applied since 2 September 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nVisa information system (VIS) (European Commission)\nIT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (Council of the European Union).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, pp. 60–81).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 have been incorporated in the original text.
