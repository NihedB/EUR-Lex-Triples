{"celex_id": "32018R0574", "reference": "16.4.2018\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 96/7\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2018/574\nof 15 December 2017\non technical standards for the establishment and operation of a traceability system for tobacco products\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2014/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and repealing Directive 2001/37/EC (1), and in particular Article 15(11) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn order to address the issue of illicit trade in tobacco products, Directive 2014/40/EU provides that all unit packets of tobacco products are to be marked with a unique identifier in order for their movements to be recorded. This will enable such products to be tracked and traced throughout the Union. Technical specifications regarding the system's establishment and operation, as well as its compatibility throughout the Union, should be laid down.\n(2)\nRules concerning the marking of packages with a unique identifier, the recording and transmission of data, the processing, storing and accessing of data and the compatibility of components of the traceability system should be set.\n(3)\nLegislative action at Union level is also necessary in order to implement Article 8 of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (2) (‘WHO FCTC Protocol’), which has been ratified by the European Union (3) and provides for a global tracking and tracing regime for tobacco products, to be established by the Parties to the WHO FCTC Protocol within five years of its entry into force.\n(4)\nIn order to combat multiple existing types of fraudulent activities that result in illicit products being made available to consumers, including practices that entail the false declaration of exports, the traceability system provided for under this Regulation is to apply, in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2014/40/EU, to all tobacco products manufactured in the Union, as well as to those manufactured outside the Union insofar as they are destined for or placed on the Union market.\n(5)\nIn order to provide for the independence of the traceability system and guarantee that it is controlled by the Member States, as provided for under Article 8 of the WHO FCTC Protocol, a proper assignment of roles in relation to the marking of packages with a unique identifier is essential. The key task of generation of the unique identifiers at unit packet level should be attributed to an independent third party appointed by each Member State (‘ID issuer’).To avoid the risk that two or more ID issuers, independently of each other, generate the same unique identifier, each ID issuer should be identified by a unique identification code, which should also form part of the unique identifiers issued by them.\n(6)\nIn order to guarantee the uniqueness of the identifier, a serial number generated by the ID issuer should form part of each unique identifier that has a negligible probability of being guessed by falsifiers.\n(7)\nWhen requesting unit packet unique identifiers from an ID issuer, manufacturers and importers should be required to provide all information necessary for the issuer to be able to generate that identifier, in accordance with Article 15(2), points (a) to (h) of Directive 2014/40/EU, with the exception of date and time of manufacture, which may not be possible to determine in advance and which should be added by economic operators at the moment of production.\n(8)\nThe length of the unit level unique identifier may impact the speed at which it can be applied to unit packets by tobacco product manufacturers or importers. In order to avoid an excessive impact on this process whilst ensuring sufficient space for all information required at unit packet level, the maximum permitted number of alphanumeric characters for the unit level unique identifier should be laid down.\n(9)\nIn order to ensure that unit level unique identifiers are capable of meeting the requirements relating to the maximum permitted number of alphanumeric characters, information required under Article 15(2) points (a) to (h) of Directive 2014/40/EU should be translated into code.\n(10)\nFor the purpose of enabling the competent authorities of the Member States to decode the unique identifiers without accessing the information stored in the repositories system, flat-files should be established and maintained by the ID issuers. Such flat-files should enable all information codified in the unique identifier codes to be identified. The size of such flat-files should be defined, in order to ensure that they can be downloaded to the devices used by Member States when reading the unique identifiers in offline mode (offline flat-files).\n(11)\nDirective 2014/40/EU provides that the recording obligations established pursuant to Article 15 may be complied with by the marking and recording of aggregated packaging, such as cartons, mastercases or pallets, provided that the tracking and tracing of all unit packets remains possible. Where economic operators opt to make use of that possibility, they should be required to ensure that such packaging is marked with an aggregated level identifier which is also unique and therefore capable of unequivocally identifying any lower aggregated levels and ultimately the unit packets that it contains.\n(12)\nIn order to ensure that all movements of the unit packets can be recorded and transmitted, manufacturers and importers should verify the unique identifiers so as to ensure their correct application and readability. To control this critical process for the unit level unique identifiers, anti-tampering devices, which are to be supplied by an independent third party, should be installed on the devices used for verification purposes. In laying down rules on the installation of such devices, it is appropriate to take into account differences between undertakings, particularly as regards their size, production output and nature of the production process, so as to ensure that compliance with this requirement does not entail an excessive burden, particularly, on smaller operators, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As anti-tampering devices are of particular relevance to the automated production of tobacco products, for the purpose of ensuring that the integrity of unit level unique identifiers is adequately protected, it is appropriate to limit the obligation to install such devices to operators other than those that use fully manual production processes.\n(13)\nIn order to minimise the impact of the traceability system on production and distribution schemes, economic operators should be permitted to order batches of the unique identifiers in advance. However, to avoid overstocking of the unique identifiers by economic operators and to control the size of individual orders, a time limit for the application of unique identifiers issued at both unit packet and aggregated levels should be set. These measures should also alleviate potential excessive impacts on the generation and issuing activities performed by the ID issuers.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure the proper functioning of the traceability system, economic operators and operators of first retail outlets should apply in advance to the relevant ID issuers for an economic operator identifier code and for a facility identifier code for each facility. The assignment of economic operator identifier codes and facility identifier codes permits the efficient identification of all purchasers and of the actual shipment route from manufacturing to the first retail outlet as provided for in Article 15(2) points (i) and (j) of Directive 2014/40/EU.\n(15)\nManufacturers or importers should in addition apply for an identifier code for machines used to manufacture tobacco products. The obligation to apply for machine identifier codes permits the efficient identification of the machine used to manufacture the tobacco products in accordance with Article 15(2) point (c) of Directive 2014/40/EU.\n(16)\nIn order to ensure that the information contained in the unique identifier is capable of being recorded and transmitted by all relevant economic operators, as well as to guarantee the compatibility of the unique identifier with external components such as scanning devices, the types of permitted data carriers should be specified.\n(17)\nIn order for the traceability system to be able to achieve its objective, it is necessary for it to be capable of enabling easy transmission of all relevant data, providing secure storage of data and ensuring full access to this data for the Commission, the competent authorities of the Member States and the external auditor. The storage architecture should further allow manufacturers and importers to select independent third party data storage providers with which to conclude data storage contracts for the purpose of hosting data related exclusively to their tobacco products (‘primary repositories’), as provided for by Article 15(8) of Directive 2014/40/EU, whilst ensuring authorities are provided with full access to all stored data for the purpose of carrying out their monitoring and enforcement activities. The effectiveness of such monitoring and enforcement activities requires the presence of a single second-level repository system (‘secondary repository’), containing a copy of all the data stored in the primary repositories and providing authorities with a global overview of the functioning of the traceability system. A routing system, operated by the provider of the secondary repository, should be established in order to provide economic operators other than manufacturers and importers with a single entry point to submit the data recorded by them to the traceability system and thereby ease the data transmission. At the same time, the routing service should ensure that data are transmitted to the correct primary repository.\n(18)\nIn order to guarantee full access for relevant authorities and to contribute to the efficient functioning of the traceability system, the provider of the secondary repository should develop user interfaces enabling the stored data to be viewed and queried. In accessing the repositories system the relevant authorities should be able to rely on the eIDAS (4) based reusable solutions provided as building blocks under the telecommunication part of the Connecting Europe Facility. In addition, to facilitate effective surveillance and enforcement, the user interface should allow for the possibility to define individual automatic alerts based on specific reporting events.\n(19)\nTo ensure interoperability of the components of the repositories system, technical specifications, based on non-proprietary open standards, should be established for the exchange of data between the primary repositories, the secondary repository and the routing system.\n(20)\nIn order to ensure that the required information is recorded and transmitted in a timely and uniform manner by all economic operators, the precise list of supply chain and transactional events that are required to be recorded under Article 15(2), points (i), (j) and (k) of Directive 2014/40/EU, as well as the content of the information messages to be transmitted, should be laid down.\n(21)\nGiven that the aim of a traceability system is to provide Member States and the Commission with an effective tool to fight illicit trade of tobacco products, timely availability of supply chain and transactional event data is necessary for investigation and enforcement purposes. The maximum time that may elapse between the occurrence of a relevant supply chain or transactional event and the transmission of the related information to the relevant data storage repository should therefore be established. In laying down such time-limits, it is appropriate to take into account differences between undertakings, particularly as regards their size and production output, so as to ensure that compliance with reporting obligations does not entail an excessive burden, particularly on smaller operators, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n(22)\nFor investigation and enforcement purposes, it is necessary that competent authorities of Member States and the Commission have access to a record of all economic operators and operators of first retail outlets involved in the trade of tobacco products, as well as the facilities and machines that are used by them to manufacture, store and process their products. Therefore, each ID issuer should establish and maintain a registry that contains the identifier codes for economic operators, operators of first retail outlets, machines and facilities referred to above. An up-to-date copy of these registries, along with the corresponding information, should be transferred electronically via the router to the secondary repository and compiled into an EU-wide register.\n(23)\nGiven the requirement for the traceability system to be independent of manufacturers and importers of tobacco products and to be under the control of the Member States, as provided for under Article 8 of the WHO FCTC Protocol, common criteria for the assessment of independence of all third parties involved in the traceability system (ID issuers, providers of repository services and anti-tampering devices) should be laid down. In order to ensure the continuing respect of the requirement for independence that is critical for ensuring and maintaining the integrity of the traceability system, the procedures governing the appointment of the ID issuers and other independent providers and the monitoring of their compliance with the independence criteria set out in this Regulation should undergo periodic review by the Commission. Conclusions of the review should be published by the Commission and form part of the report on the application of Directive 2014/40/EU provided for under Article 28 of that Directive.\n(24)\nThe protection of personal data processed in the context of a traceability system should be ensured in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).\n(25)\nRecourse to international standards should be possible for the purposes of demonstrating fulfilment of certain technical requirements laid down in this Regulation. Where it is not possible to prove compliance with international standards, it should be the responsibility of the persons to whom the obligations are imposed to prove, by verifiable means, that they comply with those requirements.\n(26)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 25 of Directive 2014/40/EU,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the technical standards for the establishment and operation of the traceability system provided for in Article 15 of Directive 2014/40/EU.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, in addition to the definitions laid down in Article 2 of Directive 2014/40/EU, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘unique identifier’ means the alphanumeric code enabling the identification of a unit pack or an aggregated packaging of tobacco products;\n(2)\n‘economic operator’ means any natural or legal person who is involved in the trade of tobacco products, including for export, from the manufacturer to the last economic operator before the first retail outlet;\n(3)\n‘first retail outlet’ means the facility where tobacco products are placed on the market for the first time, including vending machines used for the sale of tobacco products;\n(4)\n‘export’ means shipment from the Union to a third country;\n(5)\n‘aggregated packaging’ means any packaging containing more than one unit packet of tobacco products;\n(6)\n‘facility’ means any location, building or vending machine where tobacco products are manufactured, stored or placed on the market;\n(7)\n‘anti-tampering device’ means the device allowing for the recording of the verification process following the application of each unit level unique identifier by means of a video or a log file, which once recorded cannot be further altered by an economic operator;\n(8)\n‘offline flat-files’ means the electronic files established and maintained by each ID issuer that contain data in a plain text format allowing for the extraction of information encoded in the unique identifiers (excluding the time stamp) used at the unit packet and aggregated packaging levels without accessing the repositories system;\n(9)\n‘registry’ means the record established and maintained by each ID issuer of all the identifier codes generated for economic operators, operators of first retail outlets, facilities and machines along with the corresponding information;\n(10)\n‘data carrier’ means a carrier representing data in a form readable with the aid of a device;\n(11)\n‘machine’ means the equipment used for the manufacture of tobacco products which is integral to the manufacturing process;\n(12)\n‘time stamp’ means the date and time of occurrence of a particular event recorded in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time in a prescribed format;\n(13)\n‘primary repository’ means a repository storing traceability data relating exclusively to the products of a given manufacturer or importer;\n(14)\n‘secondary repository’ means a repository containing a copy of all traceability data stored in the primary repositories;\n(15)\n‘router’ means a device established within the secondary repository that transfers data between different components of the repositories system;\n(16)\n‘repositories system’ means the system consisting of the primary repositories, the secondary repository and the router;\n(17)\n‘common data dictionary’ means a set of information describing the contents, format, and structure of a database and the relationship between its elements, used to control access to and manipulation of the databases common for all primary and secondary repositories;\n(18)\n‘working day’ means every day of work in the Member State for which the ID issuer is competent;\n(19)\n‘trans-loading’ means any transfer of tobacco products from one vehicle to another during which tobacco products do not enter and exit a facility;\n(20)\n‘vending van’ means a vehicle used for the delivery of tobacco products to multiple retail outlets in quantities that have not been predetermined in advance of the delivery.\nCHAPTER II\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE UNIQUE IDENTIFIER\nSECTION 1\nCommon provisions\nArticle 3\nID issuer\n1.   Each Member State shall appoint an entity (the ‘ID issuer’) responsible for generating and issuing unique identifiers, in accordance with Articles 8, 9, 11 and 13, within a maximum period of one year from the date of entry into force of this Implementing Regulation.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that an ID issuer that intends to have recourse to subcontractors for the performance of its functions shall only be considered for appointment if the identity of any subcontractors proposed has been communicated to them.\n3.   The ID issuer shall be independent and comply with the criteria set out in Article 35.\n4.   Each ID issuer shall be equipped with a unique identification code. The code shall be composed of alphanumeric characters and comply with the International Organization for Standardisation/International Electrotechnical Commission standard (‘ISO/IEC’) 15459-2:2015.\n5.   Where the same ID issuer is appointed in more than one Member State, it shall be identifiable by the same code.\n6.   Member States shall notify the Commission of the appointment of the ID issuer and of its identification code within one month of its appointment.\n7.   Member States shall ensure that information related to the identity of the ID issuer appointed and its identification code is made publicly available and accessible online.\n8.   Each Member State shall put in place adequate measures to ensure:\n(a)\nthat the ID issuer it has appointed continues to comply with the requirement of independence in accordance with Article 35; and\n(b)\nthe continuous operation of the services provided by successive ID issuers, in case a new ID issuer is appointed to take over the services from the previous ID issuer. For this purpose Member States shall require the ID issuer to develop an exit plan laying down the procedure to be followed to guarantee the continuity of the operations until the new ID issuer is appointed.\n9.   The ID issuer may establish and charge fees to economic operators solely for generating and issuing unique identifiers. Fees are to be non-discriminatory and proportionate to the number of unique identifiers generated and issued to economic operators taking into account the mode of delivery.\nArticle 4\nCompetent ID issuers for generating and issuing unique identifiers\n1.   For tobacco products manufactured in the Union, the competent ID issuer shall be the entity appointed for the Member State in which the products are manufactured.\nBy derogation to the first subparagraph, the competent ID issuer shall be the entity appointed for the Member State on whose market the products are placed, where such a requirement is imposed by that Member State.\n2.   For tobacco products imported into the Union, the competent ID issuer shall be the entity appointed for the Member State on whose market the products are placed.\n3.   For tobacco products aggregated in the Union, the competent ID issuer shall be the entity appointed for the Member State in which the products are aggregated.\n4.   For tobacco products destined for export, the competent ID issuer shall be the entity appointed for the Member State in which the products are manufactured.\n5.   In the event of the temporary absence of the competent ID issuer, the Commission may authorise economic operators to use the services of another ID issuer that has been appointed in accordance with Article 3.\nArticle 5\nValidity of unique identifiers and deactivation\n1.   Unique identifiers generated by ID issuers may be used to mark unit packets or aggregated packaging, as provided for by Articles 6 and 10, within a maximum period of six months from the date of receipt of the unique identifiers by the economic operator. After this time period unique identifiers shall become invalid and economic operators shall ensure that they are not used to mark unit packets or aggregated packaging.\n2.   The repositories system shall ensure that the unique identifiers that have not been used within the six months period referred to in paragraph 1 shall be automatically deactivated.\n3.   At any time, manufacturers and importers may obtain the deactivation of unique identifiers by transmitting a deactivation request to the relevant primary repository. Other economic operators may obtain the deactivation of the unique identifiers by transmitting a deactivation request via the router. The deactivation request shall be introduced electronically, in accordance with Article 36, and shall contain the information listed in point 2.3 of Section 2 of Chapter II of Annex II, in the format indicated therein. The deactivation shall not interfere with the integrity of the information already stored related to the unique identifier.\nSECTION 2\nUnique identifiers at unit packet level\nArticle 6\nMarking by means of unit level UIs\n1.   Manufacturers and importers shall mark each unit packet manufactured or imported in the Union with a unique identifier (‘unit level UI’) compliant with Article 8.\n2.   In the case of tobacco products that are manufactured outside the Union, the unit level UI shall be applied on the unit packet before the tobacco product is imported in the Union.\nArticle 7\nVerification of unit level UIs\n1.   Manufacturers and importers shall ensure that the application of unit level UIs is directly followed by the verification of those unit level UIs in terms of correct application and readability.\n2.   The process referred to in paragraph 1 shall be protected with an anti-tampering device supplied and installed by an independent third party who shall provide a declaration to the relevant Member States and the Commission that the installed device meets the requirements of this Regulation.\n3.   Where the process referred to in paragraph 1 fails to confirm the correct application and full readability of the unit level UI, manufacturers and importers shall re-apply the unit level UI.\n4.   Manufacturers and importers shall ensure that the information recorded by the anti-tampering device remains available for a period of nine months from the time of recording.\n5.   Manufacturers and importers shall, upon request from Member States, provide full access to the record of the verification process created by the anti-tampering device.\n6.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 2, 4 and 5, the obligation to install an anti-tampering device shall not apply:\n(a)\nuntil 20 May 2020 to production processes operated by economic operators, or where applicable, the group of undertakings to which they belong, that handled less than 120 million unit level UIs at Union level during the calendar year 2019;\n(b)\nuntil 20 May 2021 to production processes operated by economic operators falling under the definition of small and medium enterprises set out in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (6);\n(c)\nto fully manual production processes.\nArticle 8\nStructure of unit level UIs\n1.   Each unit packet of tobacco products shall be marked with a unit level UI. It shall consist of as short a sequence of alphanumeric characters as possible, not exceeding 50 characters. The sequence shall be unique to a given unit packet and shall be composed of the following data elements:\n(a)\nin the first position, the alphanumeric characters that constitute the ID issuer identification code assigned pursuant to Article 3(4);\n(b)\nan alphanumeric sequence, whose probability to be guessed shall be negligible and in any case lower than one in ten thousand (‘serial number’);\n(c)\na code (‘product code’) allowing for the determination of the following:\ni.\nthe place of manufacturing;\nii.\nthe manufacturing facility referred to in Article 16;\niii.\nthe machine used to manufacture the tobacco products referred to in Article 18;\niv.\nthe product description;\nv.\nthe intended market of retail sale;\nvi.\nthe intended shipment route;\nvii.\nwhere applicable, the importer into the Union;\n(d)\nin the last position, the time stamp in the form of a numeric sequence of eight characters, in the format YYMMDDhh, indicating the date and time of manufacture.\n2.   ID issuers shall be responsible for the generation of a code consisting of the elements listed in paragraph 1, points (a), (b), and (c).\n3.   Manufacturers or importers shall add the time stamp referred to in paragraph 1, point (d), to the code generated by the ID issuer pursuant to paragraph 2.\n4.   Unit level UIs shall not include any data elements other than those listed in paragraph 1.\nWhere ID issuers use encryption or compression for the generation of unit level UIs, they shall inform the competent authorities of the Member States and the Commission of algorithms used for such encryption and compression. Unit level UIs shall not be reused.\nArticle 9\nRequest and issuing of unit level UIs\n1.   Manufacturers and importers shall send a request to the competent ID issuer for unit level UIs referred to in Article 8. Requests shall be introduced electronically, in accordance with Article 36.\n2.   Manufacturers and importers introducing such a request shall supply the information listed in point 2.1. of Section 2 of Chapter II of Annex II, in the format indicated therein.\n3.   The ID issuer shall, within two working days from the receipt of the request and in the order indicated:\n(a)\ngenerate the codes referred to in Article 8(2);\n(b)\ntransmit the codes along with the information referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article via the router to the primary repository of the requesting manufacturer or importer, as established under Article 26; and\n(c)\nelectronically transmit the codes to the requesting manufacturer or importer.\n4.   However, a Member State may require ID issuers to offer physical delivery of unit level UIs as an alternative to electronic delivery. In cases where physical delivery of unit level UIs is offered, manufacturers and importers shall specify whether physical delivery is requested. In that case, the ID issuer shall within 10 working days from the receipt of the request, and in the following order:\n(a)\ngenerate the codes referred to in Article 8(2);\n(b)\ntransmit the codes along with the information referred to in paragraph 2 via the router to the primary repository of the requesting manufacturer or importer, as established under Article 26;\n(c)\ndeliver the codes to the requesting manufacturer or importer in the form of optical barcodes, compliant with Article 21, placed on physical carriers, such as adhesive labels.\n5.   Within one working day, manufacturers and importers may cancel a request which was sent pursuant to paragraph 1 by means of a recall message as further defined in Point 5 of Section 5 of Chapter II of Annex II.\nSECTION 3\nUnique identifiers at aggregated packaging level\nArticle 10\nMarking by means of aggregated level UIs\n1.   Where economic operators choose to comply with the recording obligations provided for under Article 15(5) of Directive 2014/40/EU by means of the recording of aggregated packaging, they shall mark aggregated packages containing tobacco products with a unique identifier (‘aggregated level UI’).\n2.   Aggregated level UIs shall be generated and issued on the basis of a request to the competent ID issuer or directly by the economic operator.\n3.   Where the aggregated level UI is generated on the basis of a request to the competent ID issuer, it shall comply with the structure set out in Article 11(1).\n4.   Where the aggregated level UI is generated directly by the economic operator, it shall consist of an individual unit code generated in accordance with ISO/IEC 15459-1:2014 or ISO/IEC 15459-4:2014 or their latest equivalents.\nArticle 11\nStructure of aggregated level UIs generated by ID issuers\n1.   For aggregated level UI generated on the basis of a request to the competent ID issuer, the structure of the aggregated level UI shall consist of a sequence of a maximum of 100 alphanumeric characters that is unique to a given aggregated package and shall be composed of the following data elements:\n(a)\nin the first position, the alphanumeric characters that constitute the ID issuer identification code assigned under Article 3(4);\n(b)\nan alphanumeric sequence, whose probability to be guessed shall be negligible and in any case lower than one in ten thousand (‘serial number’);\n(c)\nthe identifier code of the facility (as set out in Article 16) in which the aggregation process took place;\n(d)\nin the last position, the time stamp in the form of a numeric sequence of eight characters, in the format YYMMDDhh, indicating the date and time of aggregation.\n2.   ID issuers shall be responsible for the generation of a code consisting of the elements listed in paragraph 1, points (a), (b), and (c).\n3.   Economic operators shall add the time stamp, referred to in paragraph 1, point (d), to the code generated by the ID issuer pursuant to paragraph 2.\n4.   The aggregated level UI may be completed by the economic operator with additional information, provided that the maximum character limit set out in paragraph 1 is not exceeded. Any such information may only appear after the data referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 12\nLink between UI levels\n1.   The aggregated level UI shall be capable of identifying the list of all unique identifiers contained within the aggregated packaging by means of an electronically accessible link to the repositories system.\n2.   In order to establish the link referred to in paragraph 1, manufacturers and importers shall transmit to their primary repository the information listed in point 3.2 of Section 2 of Chapter II of Annex II, in the format indicated therein.\n3.   In order to establish the link referred to in paragraph 1, economic operators other than manufacturers and importers shall transmit via the router to the secondary repository the information listed in point 3.2 of Section 2 of Chapter II of Annex II, in the format indicated therein.\nArticle 13\nRequest and issuing of aggregated level UIs generated by ID issuers\n1.   Economic operators requesting aggregated level UIs on the basis of a request to the competent ID issuer shall introduce such requests electronically, in accordance with Article 36.\n2.   Economic operators introducing such requests shall supply the information listed in point 2.2. of Section 2 of Chapter II of Annex II, in the format indicated therein.\n3.   For manufacturers and importers, the ID issuer shall, within two working days from the receipt of the request and in the order indicated:\n(a)\ngenerate the code referred to in Article 11(2);\n(b)\ntransmit the codes along with the information referred to in paragraph 2 via the router to the primary repository of the requesting manufacturer or importer, as established under Article 26; and\n(c)\ntransmit the codes electronically to the requesting manufacturer or importer.\n4.

Within one working day, economic operators may cancel a request which was sent pursuant to paragraph 1 by means of a recall message as further defined in point 5 of Section 5 of Chapter II of Annex II, in the format indicated therein.\n6.   Aggregated level UIs issued by competent ID issuers shall not be reused.\nCHAPTER III\nIDENTIFIER CODES FOR ECONOMIC OPERATORS, FACILITIES AND MACHINES\nArticle 14\nRequest for an economic operator identifier code\n1.   Economic operators and operators of first retail outlets shall apply for an economic operator identifier code from the ID issuer competent for each Member State in which they operate at least one facility. Importers shall apply for an identifier code from the ID issuer competent for each Member State on whose market they place their products.\n2.   Economic operators and operators of first retail outlets introducing a request pursuant to paragraph 1 shall provide the information listed in point 1.1 of Section 1 of Chapter II of Annex II, in the format indicated therein.\n3.   For operators of first retail outlets the obligation to apply for an economic operator identifier code may also be discharged by any other registered economic operator. Such registration by the third party shall be subject to the consent of the operator of the first retail outlet. The third party shall inform the operator of the first retail outlet of the full details of the registration, including the allocated economic operator identifier code.\n4.   Economic operators and operators of first retail outlets shall inform the ID issuer of any economic operator identifier codes allocated to them by other ID issuers. If not available at the time of registration, economic operators shall provide that information at the latest within two working days from the receipt of the economic operator identifier codes allocated by another ID issuer.\n5.   Any modification of the information submitted in the initial application form and any cessation of the operator activities shall be notified by the relevant operator to the ID issuer without delay, in the formats indicated in points 1.2. and 1.3. of Section 1 of Chapter II of Annex II.\nArticle 15\nIssuing and registration of economic operator identifier codes\n1.   Upon receipt of a request pursuant to Article 14, the ID issuer shall generate an economic operator identifier code, which consists of the following data elements, to be placed in the following order:\n(a)\nin the first position, the alphanumeric characters that constitute the ID issuer identification code assigned under Article 3(4); and\n(b)\nin the second position, an alphanumeric sequence which is unique within the code pool of the ID issuer.\n2.   Within two working days, the ID issuer shall transmit the code to the requesting operator.\n3.   All the information submitted to the ID issuer in accordance with Article 14(2), and the corresponding identifier codes, shall form part of a registry to be established, managed and kept up to date by the competent ID issuer.\n4.   In duly justified cases, Member States may, in accordance with their national laws, require the ID issuer to deactivate an economic operator identifier code. In such cases the Member State shall inform the economic operator or the operator of a first retail outlet of the deactivation, together with the grounds for such deactivation. The deactivation of an economic operator identifier code shall lead to the automatic deactivation of related facility identifier codes and machine identifier codes.\n5.   Economic operators and operators of first retail outlets shall exchange information on their respective economic operator identifier codes in order to allow economic operators to record and transmit the transactional information, as provided under Article 33.\nArticle 16\nRequest for a facility identifier code\n1.   All facilities from manufacturing to the first retail outlet shall be identified by a code (‘facility identifier code’) generated by the ID issuer competent for the territory in which the facility is located.\n2.

In the absence of a reply by the Commission within that timeframe, the provider and the draft contract shall be deemed to be approved.\n4.\nWhere the Commission does not approve the proposed provider or the draft contract, or where it considers that the contract does not incorporate the key elements laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573, the manufacturer or importer concerned shall, within one month of being informed by the Commission, propose an alternative provider and/or make necessary amendments to the draft contract for further consideration by the Commission.\n5.\nOnce the proposed provider and the draft contract have been approved, the manufacturers and importers shall, within two weeks of such approval, provide in electronic format:\n(a)\na copy of the contract signed by both parties, and\n(b)\nthe declarations required to be provided as part of the contract under Articles 4 and 8 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573.\n6.\nManufacturers and importers of tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco shall notify to the Commission, by 31 December 2022, the identity of the proposed provider, a draft data storage contract containing the key elements laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573 for approval by the Commission, and the additional documentation referred to in paragraph 2.\n7.\nThe provider appointed to operate the primary repository shall only integrate its repository into the traceability system following the conclusion of the approved contract.\n8.\nA list of notified and approved third parties shall be made publicly available by the Commission on a website.\n9.\nAny amendment to the key elements of the contract, as defined in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573, shall be subject to approval by the Commission. Any other amendment to the contract shall require prior communication to the Commission.\nPART B\nThe following procedure shall apply to the selection of an independent third party operating the secondary repository system:\n1.\nThe Commission shall appoint, from amongst the providers of the primary repositories who have been approved in accordance with Part A within six months following the entry into force of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573, a provider tasked with operating the secondary repository (‘the operator of the secondary repository’) for the purpose of carrying out the services specified in Chapter V of this Regulation.\n2.\nThe appointment of the operator of the secondary repository shall be based on an assessment of objective criteria and take place no later than eight months following the entry into force of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573.\n3.\nThe result of the appointment of the operator of the secondary repository shall be made publicly available by the Commission on a website.\n4.\nEach primary repository provider appointed in accordance with Part A shall enter into an individual contract with the provider appointed to operate the secondary repository for the purpose of carrying out the services specified in Chapter V of this Regulation.\n5.\nThe contracts shall be signed and submitted to the Commission within one month from the date of the appointment.\nPART C\nThe following requirements shall apply in addition to the selection procedures outlined in Parts A and B:\n1.\nWhere the contractual relationship between a manufacturer and importer and the provider of a primary repository is terminated, or expected to be terminated, by any of the parties to the contract, for any reason, including the failure to comply with the criteria for independence laid down in Article 35, the manufacturer or importer shall immediately inform the Commission of such termination, or expected termination, and as soon as it is known, the date of the notification of termination and the date at which the termination is to take effect. The manufacturer or importer shall propose and notify to the Commission a replacement provider as soon as practicable, and at the latest, three months prior to the termination date of the existing contract. The appointment of the replacement provider shall take place in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 7 of Part A.\n2.\nIn the event that the operator of the secondary repository gives notice of its intention to cease operating that repository in accordance with the contracts entered into pursuant to paragraph 4 of Part B, it shall immediately inform the Commission thereof and of the date at which the termination is to take effect.\n3.\nWhere the finding referred to in paragraph 1 applies to the provider who has been appointed to operate the secondary repository, the contracts for the operation of the secondary repository entered into pursuant to paragraph 4 of Part B shall, in turn, be terminated by the parties.\n4.\nIn cases referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Commission shall appoint a replacement operator as soon as practicable, and at the latest, three months prior to the termination date of the existing contract.\nANNEX II\nKey messages to be sent by the economic operators\nThe messages required for regulatory purposes shall contain at least the data fields listed in this Annex.

for tobacco products\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573 on key elements of data storage contracts to be concluded as part of a traceability system for tobacco products\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/576 on technical standards for security features applied to tobacco products\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS AND THE DECISION?\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2018/574 lays down the technical standards for the establishment and operation of the traceability system provided for in Article 15 of Directive 2014/40/EU.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573 sets out the key elements to be included in data storage contracts that have to be concluded between manufacturer/importer of tobacco products and providers of primary repository storage, referred to in Article 15(8) of Directive 2014/40/EU.\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/576 lays down technical standards for the security features applied for unit packets of tobacco products placed on the EU market, as provided for in Article 16 of Directive 2014/40/EU.\nThey each stem from Directive 2014/40/EU, which sets out the EU’s rules concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products — see summary.\nKEY POINTS\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2018/574\nDirective 2014/40/EU requires unit packets of tobacco products to be marked with a unique identifier (UI) in order for their movements through the supply chain to be recorded.\nThe implementing regulation sets out the technical specifications related to the UI: each EU country must appoint an independent ID issuer responsible for generating and issuing UIs;UIs generated by ID issuers must be used to mark unit packets of tobacco products;UIs are valid for 6 months from the date of their receipt by the ordering company;manufacturers and importers must ensure that the UIs applied are verified in terms of their correct application and readability.\nIt sets out the components and general characteristics of the system of repositories for storing data concerning the movements of tobacco products and related transactions.\nIt also sets out rules for the recording and transmission of product movements and transactional information.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573\nTo ensure the effective and compliant traceability of tobacco products, data storage contracts concluded between the manufacturers and importers of tobacco products and the providers of primary repositories must include the following key services: the establishment and operation of a primary repository (to store the data) in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/574;participation in the establishment and operation of the secondary repository (to store a copy of the data) and the system router;the provision, upon request, of other ancillary technical services connected with the operation of the primary repository and that enable the system to function properly.\nThe contract must contain specifications relating to the operability, availability, performance and financial and organisational independence of the services meeting the minimum requirements as set out in the delegated and implementing regulations.\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/576\nDirective 2014/40/EU requires all unit packets of tobacco products placed on the market to carry a tamper-proof security feature, composed of visible and invisible elements, to help check whether tobacco products are authentic.\nEU countries must require security features to be composed of no less than 5 types of authentication elements, of which at least: one is overt;one is semi-covert;one is covert.\nAt least one of the authentication elements must be provided by an independent third party that meets the requirements laid down in the implementing decision.\nEU countries must require security features to be applied to unit packets of tobacco products using any of the following methods: affixing;printing;a combination of affixing and printing.\nEU countries must be able to analyse all combinations of authorised authentication elements to ensure the product is authentic.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS AND THE DECISION APPLY?\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2018/574 has applied since 6 May 2018.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2018/573 has applied since 6 May 2018.\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/576 has applied since 18
