{"celex_id": "32018R2067", "reference": "31.12.2018\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 334/94\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2018/2067\nof 19 December 2018\non the verification of data and on the accreditation of verifiers pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular the third paragraph of Article 15 and the second paragraph of Article 10a thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThis Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency to take account of the First Edition of the International Standards and Recommended Practices on Environmental Protection — Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) (Annex 16, Volume IV to the Chicago Convention) adopted by the ICAO Council at the tenth meeting of its 214th session on 27 June 2018, that are intended to apply from 2019.\n(2)\nAn overall framework of rules for the accreditation of verifiers is necessary to ensure that the verification of operator's or aircraft operator's reports in the framework of the Union's greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system, to be submitted in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 (2), is carried out by verifiers that possess the technical competence to perform the entrusted task in an independent and impartial manner and in conformity with the requirements and principles set out in this Regulation.\n(3)\nExperience in the application of Commission Regulation (EU) No 600/2012 (3) has shown the need to improve, clarify and simplify the accreditation and verification rules to further promote harmonisation and enhance the efficiency of the system. A number of amendments therefore need to be made to Regulation (EU) No 600/2012. In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be replaced.\n(4)\nDirective 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) establishes a general framework to facilitate the free movement of services and service providers in the Union while maintaining a high quality of service. Union harmonisation of the rules for accreditation and verification relating to the Union's emissions trading system should contribute to a competitive market for verifiers while ensuring transparency and information for operators and aircraft operators.\n(5)\nWhen implementing Article 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC, it is necessary to ensure a synergy between the comprehensive framework for accreditation established by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and related provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) on one hand, and the specific features of the Union's greenhouse gas emission trading system and requirements that are essential for the effective implementation of Directive 2003/87/EC on the other hand. Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 should continue to apply to those aspects of accreditation of verifiers which are not dealt with by this Regulation. In particular, it should be ensured that where, due to the internal practices of a Member State, an alternative procedure to accreditation, namely, the certification of verifiers that are natural persons, is carried out by a national authority appointed by that Member State in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, the Member State concerned shall provide documentary evidence that such authority meets a level of credibility similar to national accreditation bodies that have successfully undergone peer evaluation organised by the body recognised under Article 14 of that Regulation.\n(6)\nRegulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) provides for an independent and neutral accreditation or licensing system for environmental verifiers. For reasons of coherence and to reduce the administrative burden imposed on the Member States and economic operators, it is appropriate to take account of synergies between that and this Regulation.\n(7)\nThe system of verification and accreditation should avoid any unnecessary duplication of procedures and organisations established pursuant to other Union legal instruments that would result in an increased burden for Member States or economic operators. Therefore, it is appropriate to draw on best practices resulting from the application of harmonised standards adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation on the basis of a request made by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), such as the harmonised standard concerning general requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies, and the harmonised standard concerning requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, as well as Document EA-6/03 and other technical documents developed by the European cooperation for accreditation or by other bodies.\n(8)\nWhen establishing harmonised rules for the verification of operator's or aircraft operator's reports and the accreditation of verifiers, it is necessary to ensure that the burden imposed on operators emitting a lower amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, on aircraft operators considered small emitters within the meaning of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, as well as on the available resources of the Member States is not disproportionate to the aims pursued.\n(9)\nTo make best use of synergies and given the importance of verification of data used for the update of ex ante benchmarks and the determination of free allocation to installations, it is appropriate to include rules for verification of baseline data reports and new entrant data reports which are required by Commission Delegated Regulation …/… of 19 December 2018 determining transitional Union-wide rules for harmonised free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) into the harmonised rules for verification and accreditation of verifiers.\n(10)\nArticle 27 of Directive 2003/87/EC allows Member States to exclude small installations, subject to equivalent measures, from the Union's greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system provided that the conditions contained in that Article are met. Article 27a of Directive 2003/87/EC allows Member States to exclude installation emitting less than 2 500 tonnes, from the Union's greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system provided that the conditions contained in that Article are met. This Regulation should not apply directly to those installations excluded pursuant to Article 27 or 27a of Directive 2003/87/EC unless the Member State decides that this Regulation should apply.\n(11)\nIn accordance with the principles of Annex V to Directive 2003/87/EC, the verifier should carry out a site visit to check the boundaries of the respective installation or aircraft operator, to assess the operation of measuring devices and monitoring systems, to conduct interviews and to carry out other activities. The verifier's site visit should be waived only under specific conditions.\n(12)\nIn accordance with the principles of Annex V to Directive 2003/87/EC, the verifier should apply a risk-based approach with the aim of reaching a verification opinion providing reasonable assurance that the total emissions or tonne-kilometres are not materially misstated and the report can be verified as satisfactory. The level of assurance should relate to the depth and detail of verification activities carried out during the verification and the wording of the verification opinion statement. If the findings and information obtained during the verification process so require, the verifier should be obliged to adjust one or more activities in the verification process to meet the requirements for achieving reasonable assurance.\n(13)\nTo avoid entanglement between the role of the competent authority and the verifier, the responsibilities of a verifier when carrying out verification should be clearly defined. The verifier should take the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority as a reference point and assess whether this plan and the procedures described in this plan have been implemented correctly. Where the verifier identifies non-compliance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, it should be the responsibility of the verifier to report this non-compliance issue in the verification report.\n(14)\nFull understanding of the activities of an operator or an aircraft operator is necessary for the performance of an effective verification of an operator's or aircraft operator's report. A verifier should only perform the requested verification activities after it has ascertained following a preliminary assessment that it is competent to do so. In the pursuit of a high-quality level of verification activities, harmonised rules should be developed for a preliminary assessment to determine whether a verifier is competent, independent and impartial to carry out the requested verification activities in accordance with the rules and principles set out in this Regulation.\n(15)\nProvision of relevant information between the operator or the aircraft operator and the verifier is essential in all facets of the verification process, in particular in the pre-contractual phase, in the performance of a strategic analysis by the verifier and throughout the verification. It is necessary to establish a set of harmonised requirements that should govern this provision of information between the operator or aircraft operator and the verifier at all times.\n(16)\nAll verification activities in the verification process are interconnected and should be concluded with the issuance of a verification report by the verifier containing a verification statement that is commensurate with the outcome of the verification assessment. Harmonised requirements for the verification reports and the performance of the verification activities should be established to ensure that verification reports and verification activities in the Member States meet the same standards.\n(17)\nAnalysing the susceptibility of reported data to misstatements that could be material is an essential part of the verification process and determines how the verification activities should be carried out by the verifier. Every element in the verification process shall therefore be strongly linked to the outcome of the analysis of these risks of misstatements.\n(18)\nSpecific provision should be made for the verification of the report of aircraft operators and that of operators of sites, which are subject to Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(19)\nCorrect and effective reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by the operator or the aircraft operator is essential for the implementation of Directive 2003/87/EC. To ensure the proper functioning of the monitoring and reporting process, continuous improvement of the operator or aircraft operator's performance should be part of the verification activities performed by the verifier.\n(20)\nVerification activities and the issuance of verification reports should only be carried out by verifiers and their personnel that are competent. Verifiers should establish and continuously improve internal processes that ensure that all personnel involved in the verification activities are competent to perform the tasks entrusted to them. The criteria for determining whether a verifier is competent should be the same in all Member States and should be verifiable, objective and transparent.\n(21)\nThe national accreditation body established pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 should be empowered to accredit and issue an authoritative statement concerning the competence of a verifier to perform the verification activities pursuant to this Regulation, adopt administrative measures and carry out the surveillance of verifiers.\n(22)\nTemplates and specific file formats to be used by verifiers promote harmonisation between Member States and avoid differences in approaches. Verifiers should use templates or specific file formats developed by the Commission. Where a Member State has developed national templates or file format specifications, these should contain at least the same content as the templates developed by the Commission to ensure harmonised approaches.\n(23)\nA Member State that does not consider it economically meaningful or sustainable to establish a national accreditation body or to carry out accreditation activities should have recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State. Only national accreditation bodies that have undergone a successful peer evaluation organised by the body recognised under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 should be permitted to perform the accreditation activities pursuant to this Regulation.\n(24)\nNational accreditation bodies that demonstrate conformity with this Regulation and that have already successfully undergone peer evaluation organised by the body recognised under Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 765/2008 should be presumed to fulfil the procedural requirements imposed on national accreditation bodies such as requirements on the structure of a national accreditation body, setting up a competence process, setting up the necessary procedures and management system and arrangements to safeguard the confidentiality of information obtained and should be exempted from undergoing a new peer evaluation following the entry into force of this Regulation. In accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), environmental information contained in verified operator's or aircraft operator's reports held by the public authorities should be made public to ensure transparency, subject to certain confidentiality requirements.\n(25)\nEffective cooperation between national accreditation bodies, or where applicable other national authorities, and competent authorities is essential for the proper functioning of the greenhouse gas emission allowance system and the supervision on the quality of verification. For reasons of transparency, it is necessary to ensure that the national accreditation bodies, or where applicable, other national authorities, and competent authorities establish effective means of information exchange. Information exchanges between competent authorities and between competent authorities and national accreditation bodies or other national authorities should be governed by the strictest guarantees of confidentiality and professional secrecy and be handled in accordance with applicable national and Union law.\n(26)\nThis Regulation includes improvements to accreditation and verification that partly take into account the First Edition of the International Standards and Recommended Practices on Environmental Protection — Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) (Annex 16, Volume IV to the Chicago Convention) adopted by the ICAO Council at the tenth meeting of its 214th session on 27 June 2018. The Regulation on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC is also being amended to take account of the First Edition of the International Standards and Recommended Practices, and these two instruments are being complemented by a Delegated Act pursuant to Article 28c of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n(27)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down provisions for the

reliable for users. It shall represent faithfully that, which it either purports to represent or may reasonably be expected to represent.\nThe process of verifying operator's or aircraft operator's report shall be an effective and reliable tool in support of quality assurance and quality control procedures, providing information upon which an operator or aircraft operator can act to improve performance in monitoring and reporting emissions or data relevant for free allocation.\nArticle 7\nGeneral obligations of the verifier\n1.   The verifier shall carry out the verification and the activities required by this Chapter with the aim of providing a verification report that concludes with reasonable assurance that the operator's or aircraft operator's report is free from material misstatements.\n2.   The verifier shall plan and perform the verification with an attitude of professional scepticism, recognising that circumstances may exist that cause the information in the operator's or aircraft operator's report to contain material misstatements.\n3.   The verifier must carry out verification in the public interest, and be independent of the operator or aircraft operator and the competent authorities responsible for Directive 2003/87/EC.\n4.   During the verification, the verifier shall assess whether:\n(a)\nthe operator's or aircraft operator's report is complete and meets the requirements laid down in Annex X to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 or in Annex IV to Delegated Regulation (EU) …/…, as appropriate;\n(b)\nthe operator or aircraft operator has acted in compliance with the requirements of the greenhouse gas emissions permit and the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority, where the verification of an operator's emission report is concerned, and with the requirements of the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority, where the verification of an aircraft operator's emission or tonne-kilometre report is concerned;\n(c)\nwhere the verification of an operator's baseline data report or new entrant data report is concerned, the operator has acted in conformance with the requirements of the monitoring methodology plan pursuant to Article 8 of Delegated Regulation (EU) …/… approved by the competent authority;\n(d)\nthe data in the operator's or aircraft operator's report are free from material misstatements;\n(e)\ninformation can be provided in support of the operator's or aircraft operator's data flow activities, control system and associated procedures to improve the performance of their monitoring and reporting.\nBy way of derogation from point (c), the verifier shall assess whether the operator's monitoring methodology plan is in compliance with the requirements of Delegated Regulation (EU) …/… where the monitoring methodology plan is not subject to approval of the competent authority prior to submission of the baseline data report. If the verifier discovers that a monitoring methodology plan does not comply with Delegated Regulation (EU) …/…, the operator shall modify the monitoring methodology plan so that it complies with that Regulation.\nFor the purpose of point (d) of this paragraph, the verifier shall obtain clear and objective evidence from the operator or aircraft operator to support the reported aggregated emissions, tonne-kilometres or data relevant for free allocation taking into account all other information provided in the operator's or aircraft operator's report.\n5.   If the verifier discovers that an operator or an aircraft operator is not complying with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 or with Delegated Regulation (EU) …/…, that irregularity shall be included in the verification report even if the monitoring plan or monitoring methodology plan concerned, as appropriate, has been approved by the competent authority.\n6.   If the monitoring plan has not been approved by the competent authority pursuant to Article 12 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, is incomplete or if significant modifications referred to in Article 15(3) or (4) of that Implementing Regulation have been made during the reporting period which have not been accordingly approved by the competent authority, the verifier shall advise the operator or aircraft operator to obtain the necessary approval from the competent authority.\nIf the monitoring methodology plan is subject to the approval of the competent authority prior to submission of the baseline data report pursuant to Article 8(4) of Delegated Regulation (EU) …/… and the monitoring methodology plan has not been approved or is incomplete, or where significant modifications referred to in Article 9(5) of that Regulation have been made which have not been approved by the competent authority, the verifier shall advise the operator to obtain the necessary approval from the competent authority.\nFollowing the approval by the competent authority, the verifier shall continue, repeat or adapt the verification activities accordingly.\nIf the approval has not been obtained before the issue of the verification report, the verifier shall report this in the verification report.\nArticle 8\nPre-contractual obligations\n1.   Before accepting a verification engagement, a verifier shall obtain a proper understanding of the operator or aircraft operator and assess whether it can undertake the verification. For this purpose the verifier shall at least:\n(a)\nevaluate the risks involved to undertake the verification of the operator's or aircraft operator's report in accordance with this Regulation;\n(b)\nundertake a review of the information supplied by the operator or aircraft operator to determine the scope of the verification;\n(c)\nassess whether the engagement falls within the scope of its accreditation;\n(d)\nassess whether it has the competence, personnel and resources required to select a verification team capable of dealing with the complexity of the installation or the aircraft operator's activities and fleet as well as whether it is capable of successfully completing the verification activities within the timeframe required;\n(e)\nassess whether it is capable of ensuring that the potential verification team at its disposal holds all the competence, and persons required to carry out verification activities for that specific operator or aircraft operator;\n(f)\ndetermine, for each verification engagement requested, the time allocation needed to properly carry out the verification.\n2.   The operator or aircraft operator shall provide the verifier with all relevant information that enables the verifier to carry out the activities referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 9\nTime allocation\n1.   When determining the time allocation for a verification engagement referred to in Article 8(1)(f), the verifier shall at least take into account:\n(a)\nthe complexity of the installation or the aircraft operator's activities and fleet;\n(b)\nthe level of information and the complexity of the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority or the monitoring methodology plan, as appropriate;\n(c)\nthe required materiality level;\n(d)\nthe complexity and completeness of the data flow activities and the control system of the operator or aircraft operator;\n(e)\nthe location of information and data related to greenhouse gas emissions, tonne-kilometre data or data relevant for free allocation.\n2.   The verifier shall ensure that the verification contract provides for the possibility for time to be charged in addition to the time agreed in the contract, where such additional time is found to be needed for the strategic analysis, risk analysis or other verification activities. The situations where the additional time may be needed shall include at least the following:\n(a)\nduring the verification where the data flow activities, control activities or logistics of the operator or aircraft operator seem to be more complex than initially anticipated;\n(b)\nwhere misstatements, non-conformities, insufficient data or errors in the data sets are identified by the verifier during the verification.\n3.   The verifier shall record the time allocated in the internal verification documentation.\nArticle 10\nInformation from an operator or aircraft operator\n1.   Before the strategic analysis and at other points of time during the verification, the operator or aircraft operator shall provide the verifier with all of the following:\n(a)\nthe operator's greenhouse gas emissions permit, if this concerns the verification of an operator's emission report;\n(b)\nthe latest version of the operator's or aircraft operator's monitoring plan as well as any other relevant versions of the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority, including evidence of the approval;\n(c)\nthe latest version of the operator's monitoring methodology plan as well as any other relevant versions of the monitoring methodology plan, including, where applicable, evidence of the approval;\n(d)\na description of the operator's or aircraft operator's data flow activities;\n(e)\nthe operator's or aircraft operator's risk assessment referred to in Article 59(2)(a) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 or Article 11(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) …/…, as appropriate, and an outline of the overall control system;\n(f)\nwhere applicable, the simplified uncertainty assessment referred to in Article 7(2)(c) of Delegated Regulation (EU) …/…;\n(g)\nthe procedures mentioned in the monitoring plan as approved by the competent authority or the monitoring methodology plan, including procedures for data flow activities and control activities;\n(h)\nthe operator's or aircraft operator's annual emission, tonne-kilometre report, baseline data report or new entrant data report, as appropriate;\n(i)\nthe baseline data reports of previous allocation periods for earlier allocation phases and annual activity level reports of the previous years submitted to the competent authority for the purpose of Article 10a(21) of Directive 2003/87/EC, if applicable;\n(j)\nwhere applicable, the operator's sampling plan referred to in Article 33 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 as approved by the competent authority;\n(k)\nif the monitoring plan was modified during the reporting period, a record of all those modifications in accordance with Article 16(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066;\n(l)\nwhere applicable, the report referred to in Article 69(4) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066;\n(m)\nthe verification report from the previous year or the previous baseline period, as appropriate, if the verifier did not carry out the verification for that particular operator or aircraft operator the previous year or baseline period, as appropriate;\n(n)\nall relevant correspondence with the competent authority, in particular information related to the notification of modifications of the monitoring plan or monitoring methodology plan, as appropriate;\n(o)\ninformation on databases and data sources used for monitoring and reporting purposes, including those from Eurocontrol or another relevant organisation;\n(p)\nwhere the verification concerns the emission report of an installation carrying out the geological storage of greenhouse gases in a storage site permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC, the monitoring plan required by that Directive and the reports required by Article 14 of that Directive, covering at least the reporting period of the emissions report to be verified;\n(q)\nwhere applicable, the approval of the competent authority for not carrying out site visits for installations pursuant to Article 31(1);\n(r)\nthe operator's evidence demonstrating compliance with the uncertainty thresholds for the tiers laid down in the monitoring plan;\n(s)\nany other relevant information necessary for planning and carrying out the verification.\n2.   Before the verifier issues the verification report, the operator or aircraft operator shall provide it with the final authorised and internally validated operator's or aircraft operator's report.\nArticle 11\nStrategic analysis\n1.   At the beginning of the verification the verifier shall assess the likely nature, scale and complexity of the verification tasks by carrying out a strategic analysis of all activities relevant to the installation or the aircraft operator.\n2.
