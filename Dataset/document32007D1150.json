Community action is required to include a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection.\n(2)\nCommunity action should complement national policies directed towards improving public health, obviating sources of danger to human health and reducing health-related harm associated with drug dependence, including information and prevention policies.\n(3)\nGiven that, according to research, the morbidity and the mortality associated with drug dependence affects a sizeable number of European citizens, the health-related harm associated with drug dependence constitutes a major problem for public health.\n(4)\nThe Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the results of the final evaluation of the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan on Drugs (2000 to 2004) pointed out the need regularly to involve civil society in the formulation of the EU’s policies on drugs.\n(5)\nDecision No 1786/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 adopting a programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003 to 2008) (4) includes the development of strategies and measures on drug dependence, as one of the important lifestyle-related health determinants.\n(6)\nIn Recommendation 2003/488/EC of 18 June 2003 on the prevention and reduction of health-related harm associated with drug dependence (5), the Council recommended that Member States set as a public health objective the prevention of drug dependence and the reduction of related risks, and that they develop and implement comprehensive strategies accordingly.\n(7)\nIn December 2004, the European Council endorsed the EU Drugs Strategy 2005 to 2012, which covers all European Union drug-related activities and sets main targets. These targets include the attainment of a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion by preventing and reducing drug use, dependence and drug-related harm to health and society.\n(8)\nThe Council adopted the EU Drugs Action Plan (2005 to 2008) (6) as a crucial instrument for transposing the EU Drugs Strategy 2005 to 2012 into concrete actions. The ultimate aim of the Action Plan is to reduce significantly the prevalence of drug use among the population and to reduce the social harm and health damage caused by the use of and trade in illicit drugs.\n(9)\nThe specific programme, ‘Drug prevention and information’, established under this Decision (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Programme’) aims at implementing targets identified by the EU Drugs Strategy 2005 to 2012 and the EU Drugs Action Plans 2005 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012, by supporting projects aimed at preventing drug use, including by addressing reduction of drug-related harm and treatment methods taking into account the latest scientific knowledge.\n(10)\nIt is important and necessary to recognise the serious, immediate and long-term implications of drugs for health, for psychological and social development including the equal opportunities of those concerned, for individuals, families and communities, and to recognise the high social and economic costs to society as a whole.\n(11)\nSpecial attention should be paid to the prevention of drug use among young people who are the most vulnerable in the population. The main challenge in prevention is to encourage young people to adopt healthy lifestyles.\n(12)\nThe European Community can bring added value to the actions to be undertaken by Member States in the field of drug prevention and information, including treatment and reduction of drug-related harm, by complementing those actions and by promoting synergies.\n(13)\nIn accordance with Article 7(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7), the European Parliament should be informed by the Commission of committee proceedings relating to the implementation of this programme. In particular, the European Parliament should receive the draft annual programme when it is submitted to the management committee. In addition, the European Parliament should receive the results of voting and summary records of the meetings of that Committee.\n(14)\nComplementarity with the technical expertise of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Centre’) should be assured by making use of methodology and best practices developed by the Centre and by its involvement in the preparation of the annual work programme.\n(15)\nSince the objectives of this Decision cannot, because of the need for an exchange of information at Community level and for the Community-wide dissemination of good practices, be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, due to the need for a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach and by reason of the scale and effects of the Programme, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(16)\nBearing in mind the importance of visibility of the Community funding, the Commission should provide guidance to ensure that any authority, non-governmental organisation, international organisation or other entity receiving a grant under the Programme acknowledges properly the support received.\n(17)\nThis Decision lays down for the entire duration of the Programme, a financial envelope constituting the prime reference within the meaning of point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (8) for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.\n(18)\nCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (9), (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Financial Regulation’), and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (10), which safeguard the Community’s financial interests, should be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use.\n(19)\nAppropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests (11), Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities (12) and Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (13).\n(20)\nThe Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants.\n(21)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC, with a distinction being made between those measures which are subject to the management procedure and those which are subject to the advisory procedure, the advisory procedure being in certain cases, with a view to increased efficiency, the more appropriate.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure the effective and timely implementation of the Programme, this Decision should apply from 1 January 2007,\nHAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nEstablishment and scope of the Programme\n1.

It aims to support projects aimed at preventing drug use.\nACT\nDecision 1150/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 September establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme 'Drug prevention and information' as part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'.\nSUMMARY\nThe death rate from drug addiction in Europe is very high. It is essential to measure the immediate and long-term consequences of drug use on health and social and psychological development, and the equality of the chances of the individuals concerned.\nThe 'Drug prevention and information' programme set up by the European Union has three objectives. Specifically to:\nprevent and reduce drug use, drug addiction and the associated inherent risks;\nimprove information about drug use;\nsupport the implementation of the EU Drugs Strategy.\nTo this end, the programme supports transnational actions aimed at:\ncreating multi-disciplinary networks;\nensuring the expansion of the knowledge base, as well as the exchange of information and good practices;\nraising awareness of the health and social problems caused by drug use;\npreventing drug use.\nScope\nThe actions financed by this programme are:\nthe actions implemented by the Commission (research, surveys, conferences, campaigns, public events, analysis, Internet sites, etc.);\ntransnational projects of European interest presented by Member States or by candidate countries for membership of the EU;\nthe activities of non-governmental organisations and other bodies pursuing aims of general European interest.\nThe actions developed under this programme are open to public or private bodies, active in terms of preventing, or providing information, on drug use.\nThe programme is targeted at all groups implicated in drug use, but most particularly at ‘at risk groups’ such as young people, women, vulnerable groups and people living in socially disadvantaged areas.\nOther targeted groups include educational staff, parents, teachers, social workers, local and national authorities, medical and paramedical personnel, judicial staff, law enforcement and penitentiary authorities, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and religious communities.\nFinancing\nThe programme has a budget for 2007-2013 of EUR 21.35 million. Grants are awarded by the Commission following calls for proposals, taking into account:\nthe conformity of the proposed action with the annual work programme;\nthe consistency of the expected results with the programme objectives;\nthe sum asked for and whether it is appropriate to the expected results;\nthe geographical and social impact of the action and its likely effect on the public;\ncitizen involvement in the organisation of the bodies concerned.\nContext\nThe EU has launched a number of initiatives in its fight against drugs. In addition to the EU Drugs Strategy for the period 2005-2012, an Action Plan was adopted in order to translate the strategy into concrete actions.\nThe 'Drug prevention and information' programme forms part of the general programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’ 2007-2013 aimed at promoting freedom, security and justice in the EU. The latter also includes the Criminal Justice, Civil Justice, and Fundamental Rights and Citizenship specific programmes, and the Daphne III programme on combating violence.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 1150/2007/EC\n23.10.2007\n-\nOJ L 257, 3.10.2007\nRELATED ACTS\nReport on the interim evaluation of the specific Programme ‘Drug prevention and information’ for the period 2007-2013 [COM(2011) 246 final - Not published in the Official Journal].\nThe evaluation of the programme shows that it has recorded good results during the first three years of implementation and that several objectives have been achieved. The Commission regrets, however, the insufficient budget it has at its disposal and which prevents the programme from having a real effect at European level. It therefore proposes to increase the financial resources of the programme, and also to prioritise projects with a European dimension, to simplify the administrative procedures and to improve the dissemination of the results obtained.\nSee also\nThe website of the European Commission Directorate-General for Justice: Drug control policy\nLast updated: 07.11.2011", "tags": ["public health", "drug addiction", "EU programme", "public awareness campaign"], "subjects": ["Public health", "Social provisions"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
