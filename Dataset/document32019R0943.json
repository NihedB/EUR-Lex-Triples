{"celex_id": "32019R0943", "reference": "14.6.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 158/54\nREGULATION (EU) 2019/943 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 5 June 2019\non the internal market for electricity\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nThe Energy Union aims to provide final customers – household and business – with safe, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy. Historically, the electricity system was dominated by vertically integrated, often publicly owned, monopolies with large centralised nuclear or fossil fuel power plants. The internal market for electricity, which has been progressively implemented since 1999, aims to deliver a real choice for all consumers in the Union new business opportunities and more cross-border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices and higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability. The internal market for electricity has increased competition, in particular at the wholesale level, and cross-zonal trade. It remains the foundation of an efficient energy market.\n(3)\nThe Union's energy system is in the middle of its most profound change in decades and the electricity market is at the heart of that change. The common goal of decarbonising the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market participants. At the same time, technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross-border cooperation.\n(4)\nThis Regulation establishes rules to ensure the functioning of the internal market for electricity and includes requirements related to the development of renewable forms of energy and environmental policy, in particular specific rules for certain types of renewable power-generating facilities, concerning balancing responsibility, dispatch and redispatching, as well as a threshold for CO2 emissions of new generation capacity where such capacity is subject to temporary measures to ensure the necessary level of resource adequacy, namely, capacity mechanisms.\n(5)\nElectricity from renewable sources from small power-generating facilities should be granted priority dispatch either via a specific priority order in the dispatching methodology or via legal or regulatory requirements for market operators to provide this electricity on the market. Priority dispatch which has been granted in the system operation services under the same economic conditions should be considered to comply with this Regulation. In any case, priority dispatch should be deemed to be compatible with the participation in the electricity market of power-generating facilities using renewable energy sources.\n(6)\nState interventions, often designed in an uncoordinated manner, have led to increasing distortions of the wholesale electricity market, with negative consequences for investments and cross-border trade.\n(7)\nIn the past, electricity customers were purely passive, often buying electricity at regulated prices which had no direct relation to the market. In the future, customers need to be enabled to fully participate in the market on equal footing with other market participants and need to be empowered to manage their energy consumption. To integrate the growing share of renewable energy, the future electricity system should make use of all available sources of flexibility, particularly demand side solutions and energy storage, and should make use of digitalisation through the integration of innovative technologies with the electricity system. To achieve effective decarbonisation at the lowest cost, the future electricity system also needs to encourage energy efficiency. The completion of the internal energy market through the effective integration of renewable energy can drive investments in the long term and can contribute to delivering the objectives of the Energy Union and the 2030 climate and energy framework, as set out in the Commission communication of 22 January 2014 entitled ‘A policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030’, and endorsed in the conclusions adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 23 and 24 October 2014.\n(8)\nMore market integration and the change towards a more volatile electricity production requires increased efforts to coordinate national energy policies with neighbours and to use the opportunities of cross-border electricity trade.\n(9)\nRegulatory frameworks have developed, allowing electricity to be traded across the Union. That development has been supported by the adoption of several network codes and guidelines for the integration of the electricity markets. Those network codes and guidelines contain provisions on market rules, system operation and network connection. To ensure full transparency and increase legal certainty, the main principles of market functioning and capacity allocation in the balancing, intraday, day-ahead and forward market timeframes should also be adopted pursuant to the ordinary legislative procedure and incorporated in a Union legislative single act.\n(10)\nArticle 13 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 (5) establishes a process whereby transmission system operators are able to delegate all or part of their tasks to a third party. The delegating transmission system operators should remain responsible for ensuring compliance with this Regulation. Moreover, Member States should be able to assign tasks and obligations to a third party. Such assignment should be limited to tasks and obligations carried out at national level, such as imbalance settlement. The limitations on such assignment should not lead to unnecessary changes to existing national arrangements. However, transmission system operators should remain responsible for the tasks entrusted to them under Article 40 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(11)\nWith regard to balancing markets, efficient and non-distortive price formation in the procurement of balancing capacity and balancing energy requires that balancing capacity contracts do not set the price for balancing energy. This is without prejudice for the dispatching systems using an integrated scheduling process in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/2195.\n(12)\nArticles 18, 30 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 establish that the pricing method for both standard and specific products for balancing energy should create positive incentives for market participants in keeping their own balance or helping to restore the system balance in their imbalance price area, thereby reducing system imbalances and costs to society. Such pricing approaches should strive for the economically efficient use of demand response and other balancing resources, subject to operational security limits.\n(13)\nThe integration of balancing energy markets should facilitate the efficient functioning of the intraday market in order to provide the possibility for market participants to balance themselves as closely as possible to real time, enabled by the balancing energy gate closure times provided for in Article 24 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195. Only the imbalances remaining after the end of the intraday market should be balanced by transmission system operators in the balancing market. Article 53 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 also provides for the harmonisation of the imbalance settlement period at 15 minutes in the Union. That harmonisation is intended to support intraday trading and foster the development of a number of trading products with the same delivery windows.\n(14)\nIn order to enable transmission system operators to procure and use balancing capacity in an efficient, economic and market-based manner, there is a need to foster market integration. In that regard, Title IV of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 establishes three methodologies through which transmission system operators are entitled to allocate cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity and the sharing of reserves, when supported on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis: the co-optimisation process, the market-based allocation process and the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis. The co-optimisation allocation process is to be performed on a day-ahead basis. By contrast, it is possible to perform the market-based allocation process where the contracting is carried out not more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity and to perform the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis where the contracting is done more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity, provided that the volumes allocated are limited and that an assessment is carried out annually. Once a methodology for the process of allocating cross-zonal capacity is approved by the relevant regulatory authorities, early application of that methodology by two or more transmission system operators could take place to allow them to gain experience and to allow for the smooth application of that methodology by more transmission system operators in the future. The application of such methodologies should nevertheless be harmonised by all transmission system operators in order to foster market integration.\n(15)\nTitle V of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 established that the general objective of imbalance settlement is to ensure that balance responsible parties keep their own balance or help restore the system balance in an efficient way and to provide incentives to market participants for keeping or helping to restore the system balance. To make balancing markets and the overall energy system fit for the integration of the increasing share of variable renewable energy, imbalance prices should reflect the real-time value of energy. All market participants should be financially responsible for the imbalances they cause in the system, representing the difference between the allocated volume and the final position in the market. For demand response aggregators, the allocated volume consists of the volume of energy physically activated by the participating customers' load, based on a defined measurement and baseline methodology.\n(16)\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 (7) sets out detailed guidelines on cross-zonal capacity allocation and congestion management in the day-ahead and intraday markets, including the requirements for the establishment of common methodologies for determining the volumes of capacity simultaneously available between bidding zones, criteria to assess efficiency and a review process for defining bidding zones. Articles 32 and 34 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 set out rules on review of bidding zone configuration, Articles 41 and 54 thereof set out harmonised limits on maximum and minimum clearing prices for day-ahead and intraday timeframes, Article 59 thereof sets out rules on intraday cross-zonal gate closure times, whereas Article 74 thereof sets out rules on redispatching and countertrading cost sharing methodologies.\n(17)\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2016/1719 (8) sets out detailed rules on cross-zonal capacity allocation in the forward markets, on the establishment of a common methodology to determine long-term cross-zonal capacity, on the establishment of a single allocation platform at European level offering long-term transmission rights, and on the possibility to return long-term transmission rights for subsequent forward capacity allocation or to transfer long-term transmission rights between market participants. Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1719 sets out rules on forward hedging products.\n(18)\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2016/631 (9) sets out the requirements for grid connection of power-generating facilities to the interconnected system, in particular with respect to synchronous power-generating modules, power park modules and offshore power park modules. Those requirements help to ensure fair conditions of competition in the internal electricity market, to ensure system security and the integration of electricity from renewable sources, and to facilitate Union-wide trade in electricity. Articles 66 and 67 of Regulation (EU) 2016/631 set out rules for emerging technologies in electricity generation.\n(19)\nBidding zones reflecting supply and demand distribution are a cornerstone of market-based electricity trading and are a prerequisite for reaching the full potential of capacity allocation methods including the flow-based approach. Bidding zones therefore should be defined in a manner to ensure market liquidity, efficient congestion management and overall market efficiency. When a review of an existing bidding zone configuration is launched by a single regulatory authority or transmission system operator with the approval of its competent regulatory authority, for the bidding zones inside the transmission system operator's control area, if the bidding zone configuration has negligible impact on neighbouring transmission system operators' control areas, including interconnectors, and the review of bidding zone configuration is necessary to improve efficiency, to maximise cross-border trading opportunities or to maintain operational security, the transmission system operator in the relevant control area and the competent regulatory authority should be, respectively, the only transmission system operator and the only regulatory authority participating in the review. The relevant transmission system operator and the competent regulatory authority should give the neighbouring transmission system operators prior notice of the review and the results of the review should be published. It should be possible to launch a regional bidding zone review following the technical report on congestion in line with Article 14 of this Regulation or in accordance with existing procedures laid down in Regulation (EU) 2015/1222.\n(20)\nWhen regional coordination centres carry out a capacity calculation, they should maximise capacity considering non-costly remedial actions and respecting the operational security limits of transmission system operators in the Capacity Calculation Region. Where the calculation does not result in capacity equal to or above the minimum capacities set out in this Regulation, regional coordination centres should consider all available costly remedial actions to further increase capacity up to the minimum capacities, including redispatching potential within and between the capacity calculation regions, while respecting the operational security limits of transmission system operators of the Capacity Calculation Regions. Transmission system operators should report accurately and transparently on all aspects of capacity calculation in accordance with this Regulation and should ensure that all information sent to regional coordination centres is accurate and fit for purpose.\n(21)\nWhen performing capacity calculation, regional coordination centres should calculate cross-zonal capacities using data from transmission system operators which respects the operational security limits of the transmission system operators' respective control areas. Transmission system operators should be able to deviate from coordinated capacity calculation where its implementation would result in a violation of the operational security limits of network elements in their control area. Those deviations should be carefully monitored and transparently reported to prevent abuse and ensure that the volume of interconnection capacity to be made available to market participants is not limited in order to solve congestion inside a bidding zone. Where an action plan is in place, the action plan should take account of deviations and address their cause.\n(22)\nCore market principles should set out that electricity prices are to be determined through demand and supply. Those prices should indicate when electricity is needed, thereby providing market-based incentives for investments into flexibility sources such as flexible generation, interconnection, demand response or energy storage.\n(23)\nWhile decarbonisation of the electricity sector, with energy from renewable sources becoming a major part of the market, is one of the goals of the Energy Union, it is crucial that the market removes existing barriers to cross-border trade and encourages investments into supporting infrastructure, for example, more flexible generation, interconnection, demand response and energy storage. To support this shift to variable and distributed generation, and to ensure that energy market principles are the basis for the Union's electricity markets of the future, a renewed focus on short-term markets and scarcity pricing is essential.\n(24)\nShort-term markets improve liquidity and competition by enabling more resources to participate fully in the market, especially those resources that are more flexible. Effective scarcity pricing will encourage market participants to react to market signals and to be available when the market most needs them and ensures that they can recover their costs in the wholesale market. It is therefore critical to ensure that administrative and implicit price caps are removed in order to allow for scarcity pricing. When fully embedded in the market structure, short-term markets and scarcity pricing contribute to the removal of other market distortive measures, such as capacity mechanisms, in order to ensure security of supply. At the same time, scarcity pricing without price caps on the wholesale market should not jeopardize the possibility of offering reliable and stable prices to final customers, in particular household customers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and industrial customers.\n(25)\nWithout prejudice to Articles 107, 108 and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), derogations from fundamental market principles such as balancing responsibility, market-based dispatch, or redispatch reduce flexibility signals and act as barriers to the development of solutions such as energy storage, demand response or aggregation. While derogations are still necessary to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden to certain market participants, in particular household customers and SMEs, broad derogations covering entire technologies are not consistent with the aim of achieving efficient market-based decarbonisation processes and should thus be replaced by more targeted measures.\n(26)\nA precondition for effective competition in the internal market for electricity is non-discriminatory, transparent and adequate charges for network use including interconnecting lines in the transmission system.\n(27)\nUncoordinated curtailments of interconnector capacities increasingly limit the exchange of electricity between Member States and have become a serious obstacle to the development of a functioning internal market for electricity. The maximum level of capacity of interconnectors and the critical network elements should therefore be made available, complying with the safety standards of secure network operation including respecting the security standard for contingencies (N-1). However, there are some limitations to setting the capacity level in a meshed grid. Clear minimum levels of available capacity for cross-zonal trade need to be put in place in order to reduce the effects of loop flows and internal congestions on cross-zonal trade and to give a predictable capacity value for market participants. Where the flow-based approach is used, that minimum capacity should determine the minimum share of the capacity of a cross-zonal or an internal critical network element respecting operational security limits to be used as an input for coordinated capacity calculation under Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, taking into account contingencies. The total remaining share of capacity may be used for reliability margins, loop flows and internal flows. Furthermore, in the case of foreseeable problems for ensuring grid security, derogations should be possible for a limited transitional phase. Such derogations should be accompanied by a methodology and projects providing for a long-term solution.\n(28)\nThe transmission capacity to which the 70 % minimum capacity criterion shall apply in the net transmission capacity (NTC) approach is the maximum transmission of active power which respects operational security limits and takes into account contingencies. The coordinated calculation of this capacity also takes into account that electricity flows are distributed unevenly between individual components and is not just adding capacities of interconnecting lines. This capacity does not take into account the reliability margin, loop flows or internal flows which are taken into account within the remaining 30 %.\n(29)\nIt is important to avoid distortion of competition resulting from the differing safety, operational and planning standards used by transmission system operators in Member States. Moreover, there should be transparency for market participants concerning available transfer capacities and the security, planning and operational standards that affect the available transfer capacities.\n(30)\nTo efficiently steer necessary investments, prices also need to provide signals where electricity is most needed. In a zonal electricity system, correct locational signals require a coherent, objective and reliable determination of bidding zones via a transparent process. In order to ensure efficient operation and planning of the Union electricity network and to provide effective price signals for new generation capacity, demand response and transmission infrastructure, bidding zones should reflect structural congestion. In particular, cross-zonal capacity should not be reduced in order to resolve internal congestion.\n(31)\nTo reflect the divergent principles of optimising bidding zones without jeopardising liquid markets and grid investments two options should be provided for in order to address congestion. Member States should be able to choose between a reconfiguration of their bidding zone or measures such as grid reinforcement and grid optimisation. The starting point for such a decision should be the identification of long-term structural congestions by the transmission system operator or operators of a Member State, by a report by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (the ‘ENTSO for Electricity’) on congestion or by a bidding zone review. Member States should first try to find a common solution on how to best address congestion. In the course of doing so Member States might adopt multinational or national action plans to address congestion. For Member States which adopt an action plan to address congestion, a phase-in period in the form of a linear trajectory for the opening of interconnectors should apply. At the end of the implementation of such an action plan, Member States should have a possibility to choose whether to opt for a reconfiguration of the bidding zone(s) or whether to opt for addressing remaining congestion through remedial actions for which they bear the costs. In the latter case their bidding zone should not be reconfigured against the will of that Member State, provided that the minimum capacity is reached. The minimum level of capacity that should be used in coordinated capacity calculation should be a percentage of the capacity of a critical network element, as defined following the selection process under Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, after, or, in the case of a flow-based approach, while, respecting the operational security limits in contingency situations. A Commission decision on the configuration of a bidding zone should be possible as a measure of last resort and should only amend the configuration of a bidding zone in those Member States which have opted to split the bidding zone or which have not reached the minimum level of the capacity.\n(32)\nEfficient decarbonisation of the electricity system via market integration requires systematically abolishing barriers to cross-border trade to overcome market fragmentation and to allow Union energy customers to fully benefit from the advantages of integrated electricity markets and competition.\n(33)\nThis Regulation should lay down basic principles with regard to tarification and capacity allocation, while providing for the adoption of guidelines detailing further relevant principles and methodologies, in order to allow rapid adaptation to changed circumstances.\n(34)\nThe management of congestion problems should provide correct economic signals to transmission system operators and market participants and should be based on market mechanisms.\n(35)\nIn an open, competitive market, transmission system operators should be compensated for costs incurred as a result of hosting cross-border flows of electricity on their networks by the operators of the transmission systems from which cross-border flows originate and the systems where those flows end.\n(36)\nPayments and receipts resulting from compensation between transmission system operators should be taken into account when setting national network tariffs.\n(37)\nThe actual amount payable for cross-border access to the system can vary considerably, depending on the transmission system operator involved and as a result of differences in the structure of the tarification systems applied in Member States. A certain degree of harmonisation is therefore necessary in order to avoid distortions of trade.\n(38)\nThere should be rules on the use of revenues from congestion-management procedures, unless the specific nature of the interconnector concerned justifies an exemption from those rules.\n(39)\nTo provide for a level playing field between all market participants, network tariffs should be applied in a way which does not positively or negatively discriminate between production connected at the distribution level and production connected at the transmission level. Network tariffs should not discriminate against energy storage, and should not create disincentives for participation in demand response or represent an obstacle to improving energy efficiency.\n(40)\nIn order to increase transparency and comparability in tariff-setting where binding harmonisation is not seen as adequate, a best practices report on tariff methodologies should be issued by the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (‘ACER’) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/942 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(41)\nTo better ensure optimal investment in the trans-European grid and to better address the challenge where viable interconnection projects cannot be built for lack of prioritisation at national level, the use of congestion rents should be reconsidered and contribute to guarantee availability and maintain or increase interconnection capacities.\n(42)\nIn order to ensure optimal management of the electricity transmission network and to allow trading and supplying electricity across borders in the Union, the ENTSO for Electricity, should be established. The tasks of the ENTSO for Electricity should be carried out in accordance with Union's competition rules which remain applicable to the decisions of the ENTSO for Electricity. The tasks of the ENTSO for Electricity should be well-defined and its working method should ensure efficiency and transparency. The network codes prepared by the ENTSO for Electricity are not intended to replace the necessary national network codes for non-cross-border issues. Given that more effective progress may be achieved through an approach at regional level, transmission system operators should set up regional structures within the overall cooperation structure, whilst ensuring that results at regional level are compatible with network codes and non-binding ten-year network development plans at Union level. Member States should promote cooperation and monitor the effectiveness of the network at regional level. Cooperation at regional level should be compatible with progress towards a competitive and efficient internal market for electricity.\n(43)\nThe ENTSO for Electricity should carry out a robust medium to long-term European resource adequacy assessment to provide an objective basis for the assessment of adequacy concerns. The resource adequacy concern that capacity mechanisms address should be based on the European resource adequacy assessment. That assessment may be complemented by national assessments.\n(44)\nThe methodology for the long-term resource adequacy assessment (from ten-year-ahead to year-ahead) set out in this Regulation has a different purpose than the seasonal adequacy assessments (six months ahead) as set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11). Medium to long-term assessments are mainly used to identify adequacy concerns and to assess the need for capacity mechanisms whereas seasonal adequacy assessments are used to alert to short-term risks that might occur in the following six months that are likely to result in a significant deterioration of the electricity supply situation. In addition, regional coordination centres also carry out regional adequacy assessments on electricity transmission system operation. Those are very short-term adequacy assessments (from week-ahead to day-ahead) used in the context of system operation.\n(45)\nBefore introducing capacity mechanisms, Member States should assess the regulatory distortions contributing to the related resource adequacy concern. Member States should be required to adopt measures to eliminate the identified distortions, and should adopt a timeline for their implementation. Capacity mechanisms should only be introduced to address the adequacy problems that cannot be solved through the removal of such distortions.\n(46)\nMember States intending to introduce capacity mechanisms should derive resource adequacy targets on the basis of a transparent and verifiable process. Member States should have the freedom to set their own desired level of security of supply.\n(47)\nPursuant to Article 108 TFEU, the Commission has exclusive competence to assess the compatibility with the internal market of State aid measures which the Member States may put in place. That assessment is to be carried out on the basis of Article 107(3) TFEU and in accordance with the relevant provisions and guidelines which the Commission may adopt to that effect. This Regulation is without prejudice to the Commission's exclusive competence conferred by TFEU.\n(48)\nCapacity mechanisms that are in place should be reviewed in light of this Regulation.\n(49)\nDetailed rules for facilitating effective cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms should be laid down in this Regulation. Transmission system operators should facilitate the cross-border participation of interested producers in capacity mechanisms in other Member States. Therefore, they should calculate capacities up to which cross-border participation would be possible, should enable participation and should check availabilities. Regulatory authorities should enforce the cross-border rules in the Member States.\n(50)\nCapacity mechanisms should not result in overcompensation, while at the same time they should ensure security of supply. In that regard, capacity mechanisms other than strategic reserves should be constructed to ensure that the price paid for availability automatically tends to zero when the level of capacity which would be profitable on the energy market in the absence of a capacity mechanism is expected to be adequate to meet the level of capacity demanded.\n(51)\nTo support Member States and regions facing social, industrial and economic challenges due to the energy transition, the Commission has set up a coal and carbon-intensive regions initiative. In that context, the Commission should assist Member States, including with targeted financial support to enable a ‘just transition’ in those regions, where available.\n(52)\nIn view of the differences between national energy systems and the technical limitations of existing electricity networks, the best approach to achieving progress in market integration is often at a regional level. Regional cooperation between transmission system operators should thus be strengthened. In order to ensure efficient cooperation, a new regulatory framework should provide for stronger regional governance and regulatory oversight, including by strengthening ACER's decision-making power with respect to cross-border issues. It is possible that closer cooperation of Member States is also needed in crisis situations, to increase security of supply and to limit market distortions.\n(53)\nCoordination between transmission system operators at regional level has been formalised with the mandatory participation of transmission system operators in regional security coordinators. The regional coordination of transmission system operators should be further developed with an enhanced institutional framework via the establishment of regional coordination centres. The establishment of regional coordination centres should take into account existing or planned regional coordination initiatives and should support the increasingly integrated operation of electricity systems across the Union, thereby ensuring their efficient and secure performance. For that reason, it is necessary to ensure that the coordination of transmission system operators through regional coordination centres takes place across the Union. Where transmission system operators of a given region are not yet coordinated by an existing or a planned regional coordination centre, the transmission system operators in that region should establish or designate a regional coordination centre.\n(54)\nThe geographical scope of regional coordination centres should allow them to contribute effectively to the coordination of the operations of transmission system operators across regions and should lead to enhanced system security and market efficiency. Regional coordination centres should have the flexibility to carry out their tasks in the region in the way which is best adapted to the nature of the individual tasks entrusted to them.\n(55)\nRegional coordination centres should carry out tasks where their regionalisation brings added value compared to tasks performed at national level. The tasks of regional coordination centres should cover the tasks carried out by regional security coordinators pursuant to the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 (12) as well as additional system operation, market operation and risk preparedness tasks. The tasks carried out by regional coordination centres should not include real-time operation of the electricity system.\n(56)\nIn performing their tasks, regional coordination centres should contribute to the achievement of the 2030 and 2050 objectives set out in the climate and energy policy framework.\n(57)\nRegional coordination centres should primarily act in the interest of system and market operation of the region. Hence, regional coordination centres should be entrusted with the powers necessary to coordinate the actions to be taken by transmission system operators of the system operation region for certain functions and with an enhanced advisory role for the remaining functions.\n(58)\nThe human, technical, physical and financial resources of regional coordination centres should not exceed what is strictly necessary for the fulfilment of their tasks.\n(59)\nThe ENTSO for Electricity should ensure that the activities of regional coordination centres are coordinated across regional boundaries.\n(60)\nIn order to increase efficiencies in the electricity distribution networks in the Union and to ensure close cooperation with transmission system operators and the ENTSO for Electricity, an entity of distribution system operators in the Union (EU DSO entity) should be established. The tasks of the EU DSO entity should be well-defined and its working method should ensure efficiency, transparency and representativeness among Union distribution system operators. The EU DSO entity should closely cooperate with the ENTSO for Electricity on the preparation and implementation of the network codes where applicable and should work on providing guidance on the integration inter alia of distributed generation and energy storage in distribution networks or other areas which relate to the management of distribution networks. The EU DSO entity should also take due account of the specificities inherent to distribution systems connected downstream with electricity systems on islands which are not connected with other electricity systems by means of interconnectors.\n(61)\nIncreased cooperation and coordination among transmission system operators is required to create network codes for providing and managing effective and transparent access to the transmission networks across borders, and to ensure coordinated and sufficiently forward-looking planning and sound technical evolution of the transmission system in the Union, including the creation of interconnection capacities, with due regard to the environment. Those network codes should be in line with non-binding framework guidelines, which are developed by ACER. ACER should have a role in reviewing, based on matters of fact, draft network codes, including their compliance with those framework guidelines, and it should be enabled to recommend them for adoption by the Commission. ACER should assess proposed amendments to the network codes and it should be enabled to recommend them for adoption by the Commission. Transmission system operators should operate their networks in accordance with those network codes.\n(62)\nExperience with the development and adoption of network codes has shown that it is useful to streamline the development procedure by clarifying that ACER has the right to revise draft electricity network codes before submitting them to the Commission.\n(63)\nTo ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market for electricity, provision should be made for procedures which allow the adoption of decisions and guidelines with regard, inter alia, to tarification and capacity allocation by the Commission whilst ensuring the involvement of regulatory authorities in that process, where appropriate through their association at Union level. Regulatory authorities, together with other relevant authorities in the Member States, have an important role to play in contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity.\n(64)\nAll market participants have an interest in the work expected of the ENTSO for Electricity. An effective consultation process is therefore essential and existing structures that are set up to facilitate and streamline the consultation process, such as via regulatory authorities or ACER, should play an important role.\n(65)\nIn order to ensure greater transparency regarding the entire electricity transmission network in the Union, the ENTSO for Electricity should draw up, publish and regularly update a non-binding Union-wide ten-year network development plan. Viable electricity transmission networks and necessary regional interconnections, relevant from a commercial or security of supply point of view, should be included in that network development plan.\n(66)\nInvestments in major new infrastructure should be promoted strongly while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity. In order to enhance the positive effect of exempted direct current interconnectors on competition and security of supply, market interest during the project-planning phase should be tested and congestion-management rules should be adopted. Where direct current interconnectors are located in the territory of more than one Member State, ACER should handle as a last resort the exemption request in order to take better account of its cross-border implications and to facilitate its administrative handling. Moreover, given the exceptional risk profile of constructing those exempt major infrastructure projects, undertakings with supply and production interests should be able to benefit from a temporary derogation from the full unbundling rules for the projects concerned. Exemptions granted under Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) continue to apply until the scheduled expiry date as decided in the granted exemption decision. Offshore electricity infrastructure with dual functionality (so-called ‘offshore hybrid assets’) combining transport of offshore wind energy to shore and interconnectors, should also be eligible for exemption such as under the rules applicable to new direct current interconnectors. Where necessary, the regulatory framework should duly consider the specific situation of those assets to overcome barriers to the realisation of societally cost-efficient offshore hybrid assets.\n(67)\nTo enhance trust in the market, its participants need to be sure that those engaging in abusive behaviour can be subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. The competent authorities should be given the competence to investigate effectively allegations of market abuse. To that end, it is necessary that competent authorities have access to data that provides information on operational decisions made by suppliers. In the electricity market, many relevant decisions are made by the producers, which should keep information in relation to those decisions available to and easily accessible by the competent authorities for a set period. The competent authorities should, furthermore, regularly monitor whether the transmission system operators comply with the rules. Small producers with no real ability to distort the market should be exempt from that obligation.\n(68)\nThe Member States and the competent authorities should be required to provide relevant information to the Commission. Such information should be treated confidentially by the Commission. Where necessary, the Commission should have an opportunity to request relevant information directly from undertakings concerned, provided that the competent authorities are informed.\n(69)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(70)\nMember States, the Energy Community Contracting Parties and other third countries which apply this Regulation or are part of the synchronous area of Continental Europe should closely cooperate on all matters concerning the development of an integrated electricity trading region and should take no measures that endanger the further integration of electricity markets or security of supply of Member States and Contracting Parties.\n(71)\nAt the time of the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, only few rules for the internal market for electricity existed at Union level. Since then, the Union internal market has become more complex due to the fundamental change the markets are undergoing in particular regarding deployment of variable renewable electricity production. The network codes and guidelines have therefore become extensive and comprehensive and encompass both technical and general issues.\n(72)\nIn order to ensure the minimum degree of harmonisation required for effective market functioning, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of non-essential elements of certain specific areas which are fundamental for market integration. Those acts should include the adoption and amendment of certain network codes and guidelines where they supplement this Regulation, the regional cooperation of transmission system operators and regulatory authorities, financial compensations between transmission system operators, as well as the application of exemption provisions for new interconnectors. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 (14) on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(73)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers in accordance with Article 291 of TFEU should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of those implementing acts.\n(74)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the provision of a harmonised framework for cross-border exchanges of electricity, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(75)\nFor reasons of coherence and legal certainty, no provision in this Regulation should prevent the application of the derogations emerging from Article 66 of Directive (EU) 2019/944,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\nThis Regulation aims to:\n(a)\nset the basis for an efficient achievement of the objectives of the

demand response facilities to provide joint offers on the electricity market and be jointly operated in the electricity system, in accordance with Union competition law;\n(f)\nmarket rules shall enable the decarbonisation of the electricity system and thus the economy, including by enabling the integration of electricity from renewable energy sources and by providing incentives for energy efficiency;\n(g)\nmarket rules shall deliver appropriate investment incentives for generation, in particular for long-term investments in a decarbonised and sustainable electricity system, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response to meet market needs, and shall facilitate fair competition thus ensuring security of supply;\n(h)\nbarriers to cross-border electricity flows between bidding zones or Member States and cross-border transactions on electricity markets and related services markets shall be progressively removed;\n(i)\nmarket rules shall provide for regional cooperation where effective;\n(j)\nsafe and sustainable generation, energy storage and demand response shall participate on equal footing in the market, under the requirements provided for in the Union law;\n(k)\nall producers shall be directly or indirectly responsible for selling the electricity they generate;\n(l)\nmarket rules shall allow for the development of demonstration projects into sustainable, secure and low-carbon energy sources, technologies or systems which are to be realised and used to the benefit of society;\n(m)\nmarket rules shall enable the efficient dispatch of generation assets, energy storage and demand response;\n(n)\nmarket rules shall allow for entry and exit of electricity generation, energy storage and electricity supply undertakings based on those undertakings' assessment of the economic and financial viability of their operations;\n(o)\nin order to allow market participants to be protected against price volatility risks on a market basis, and mitigate uncertainty on future returns on investment, long-term hedging products shall be tradable on exchanges in a transparent manner and long-term electricity supply contracts shall be negotiable over the counter, subject to compliance with Union competition law;\n(p)\nmarket rules shall facilitate trade of products across the Union and. regulatory changes shall take into account effects on both short-term and long-term forward and futures markets and products;\n(q)\nmarket participants shall have a right to obtain access to the transmission networks and distribution networks on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory terms.\nArticle 4\nJust transition\nThe Commission shall support Member States that put in place a national strategy for the progressive reduction of existing coal and other solid fossil fuel generation and mining capacity through all available means to enable a just transition in regions affected by structural change. The Commission shall assist Member States in addressing the social and economic impacts of the clean energy transition.\nThe Commission shall work in close partnership with the stakeholders in coal and carbon-intensive regions, shall facilitate the access to and use of available funds and programmes, and shall encourage the exchange of good practices, including discussions on industrial roadmaps and reskilling needs.\nArticle 5\nBalance responsibility\n1.   All market participants shall be responsible for the imbalances they cause in the system (‘balance responsibility’). To that end, market participants shall either be balance responsible parties or shall contractually delegate their responsibility to a balance responsible party of their choice. Each balance responsible party shall be financially responsible for its imbalances and shall strive to be balanced or shall help the electricity system to be balanced.\n2.   Member States may provide derogations from balance responsibility only for:\n(a)\ndemonstration projects for innovative technologies, subject to approval by the regulatory authority, provided that those derogations are limited to the time and extent necessary for achieving the demonstration purposes;\n(b)\npower-generating facilities using renewable energy sources with an installed electricity capacity of less than 400 kW;\n(c)\ninstallations benefitting from support approved by the Commission under Union State aid rules pursuant to Articles 107, 108 and 109 TFEU, and commissioned before 4 July 2019.\nMember States may, without prejudice to Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, provide incentives to market participants which are fully or partly exempted from balancing responsibility to accept full balancing responsibility.\n3.   When a Member State provides a derogation in accordance with paragraph 2, it shall ensure that the financial responsibility for imbalances is fulfilled by another market participant.\n4.   For power-generating facilities commissioned from 1 January 2026, point (b) of paragraph 2 shall apply only to generating installations using renewable energy sources with an installed electricity capacity of less than 200 kW.\nArticle 6\nBalancing market\n1.   Balancing markets, including prequalification processes, shall be organised in such a way as to:\n(a)\nensure effective non-discrimination between market participants taking account of the different technical needs of the electricity system and the different technical capabilities of generation sources, energy storage and demand response;\n(b)\nensure that services are defined in a transparent and technologically neutral manner and are procured in a transparent, market-based manner;\n(c)\nensure non-discriminatory access to all market participants, individually or through aggregation, including for electricity generated from variable renewable energy sources, demand response and energy storage;\n(d)\nrespect the need to accommodate the increasing share of variable generation, increased demand responsiveness and the advent of new technologies.\n2.   The price of balancing energy shall not be pre-determined in contracts for balancing capacity. Procurement processes shall be transparent in accordance with Article 40(4) of Directive (EU) 2019/944, while protecting the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n3.   Balancing markets shall ensure operational security whilst allowing for maximum use and efficient allocation of cross-zonal capacity across timeframes in accordance with Article 17.\n4.   The settlement of balancing energy for standard balancing products and specific balancing products shall be based on marginal pricing (pay-as-cleared) unless all regulatory authorities approve an alternative pricing method on the basis of a joint proposal by all transmission system operators following an analysis demonstrating that that alternative pricing method is more efficient.\nMarket participants shall be allowed to bid as close to real time as possible, and balancing energy gate closure times shall not be before the intraday cross-zonal gate closure time.\nTransmission system operators applying a central dispatching model may establish additional rules in accordance with the guideline on electricity balancing adopted on the basis of Article 6(11) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.\n5.   The imbalances shall be settled at a price that reflects the real-time value of energy.\n6.   Each imbalance price area shall be equal to a bidding zone, except in the case of a central dispatching model where an imbalance price area may constitute a part of a bidding zone.\n7.   The dimensioning of reserve capacity shall be performed by the transmission system operators and shall be facilitated at regional level.\n8.   The procurement of balancing capacity shall be performed by the transmission system operator and may be facilitated at a regional level. Reservation of cross-border capacity to that end may be limited. The procurement of balancing capacity shall be market-based and organised in such a way as to be non-discriminatory between market participants in the prequalification process in accordance with Article 40(4) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 whether market participants participate individually or through aggregation.\nProcurement of balancing capacity shall be based on a primary market unless and to the extent that the regulatory authority has provided for a derogation to allow the use of other forms of market-based procurement on the grounds of a lack of competition in the market for balancing services. Derogations from the obligation to base the procurement of balancing capacity on use of primary markets shall be reviewed every three years.\n9.   The procurement of upward balancing capacity and downward balancing capacity shall be carried out separately, unless the regulatory authority approves a derogation from this principle on the basis that this would result in higher economic efficiency as demonstrated by an evaluation performed by the transmission system operator. Contracts for balancing capacity shall not be concluded more than one day before the provision of the balancing capacity and the contracting period shall be no longer than one day, unless and to the extent that the regulatory authority has approved the earlier contracting or longer contracting periods to ensure the security of supply or to improve economic efficiency.\nWhere a derogation is granted, for at least 40 % of the standard balancing products and a minimum of 30 % of all products used for balancing capacity, contracts for the balancing capacity shall be concluded for no more than one day before the provision of the balancing capacity and the contracting period shall be no longer than one day. The contracting of the remaining part of the balancing capacity shall be performed for a maximum of one month in advance of the provision of balancing capacity and shall have a maximum contractual period of one month.\n10.   At the request of the transmission system operator, the regulatory authority may decide to extend the contractual period of the remaining part of balancing capacity referred to in paragraph 9 to a maximum period of twelve months provided that such a decision is limited in time, and the positive effects in terms of lowering of costs for final customers exceed the negative impacts on the market. The request shall include:\n(a)\nthe specific period during which the exemption would apply;\n(b)\nthe specific volume of balancing capacity to which the exemption would apply;\n(c)\nan analysis of the impact of the exemption on the participation of balancing resources; and\n(d)\na justification for the exemption demonstrating that such an exemption would lead to lower costs to final customers.\n11.   Notwithstanding paragraph 10, from 1 January 2026 contract periods shall not be longer than six months.\n12.   By 1 January 2028, regulatory authorities shall report to the Commission and ACER on the share of the total capacity covered by contracts with a duration or a procurement period of longer than one day.\n13.   Transmission system operators or their delegated operators shall publish, as close to real time as possible but with a delay after delivery of no more than 30 minutes, the current system balance of their scheduling areas, the estimated imbalance prices and the estimated balancing energy prices.\n14.   Transmission system operators may, where standard balancing products are not sufficient to ensure operational security or where some balancing resources cannot participate in the balancing market through standard balancing products, propose, and the regulatory authorities may approve, derogations from paragraphs 2 and 4 for specific balancing products which are activated locally without exchanging them with other transmission system operators.\nProposals for derogations shall include a description of measures proposed to minimise the use of specific products, subject to economic efficiency, a demonstration that the specific products do not create significant inefficiencies and distortions in the balancing market either inside or outside the scheduling area, as well as, where applicable, the rules and information for the process for converting the balancing energy bids from specific balancing products into balancing energy bids from standard balancing products.\nArticle 7\nDay-ahead and intraday markets\n1.   Transmission system operators and NEMOs shall jointly organise the management of the integrated day-ahead and intraday markets in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/1222. Transmission system operators and NEMOs shall cooperate at Union level or, where more appropriate, at a regional level in order to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of Union electricity day-ahead and intraday trading. The obligation to cooperate shall be without prejudice to the application of Union competition law. In their functions relating to electricity trading, transmission system operators and NEMOs shall be subject to regulatory oversight by the regulatory authorities pursuant to Article 59 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 and ACER pursuant to Articles 4 and 8 of Regulation (EU) 2019/942.\n2.   Day-ahead and intraday markets shall:\n(a)\nbe organised in such a way as to be non-discriminatory;\n(b)\nmaximise the ability of all market participants to manage imbalances;\n(c)\nmaximise the opportunities for all market participants to participate in cross-zonal trade in as close as possible to real time across all bidding zones;\n(d)\nprovide prices that reflect market fundamentals, including the real time value of energy, on which market participants are able to rely when agreeing on longer-term hedging products;\n(e)\nensure operational security while allowing for maximum use of transmission capacity;\n(f)\nbe transparent while at the same time protecting the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information and ensuring trading occurs in an anonymous manner;\n(g)\nmake no distinction between trades made within a bidding zone and across bidding zones; and\n(h)\nbe organised in such a way as to ensure that all markets participants are able to access the market individually or through aggregation.\nArticle 8\nTrade on day-ahead and intraday markets\n1.   NEMOs shall allow market participants to trade energy as close to real time as possible and at least up to the intraday cross-zonal gate closure time.\n2.   NEMOs shall provide market participants with the opportunity to trade in energy in time intervals which are at least as short as the imbalance settlement period for both day-ahead and intraday markets.\n3.   NEMOs shall provide products for trading in day-ahead and intraday markets which are sufficiently small in size, with minimum bid sizes of 500 kW or less, to allow for the effective participation of demand-side response, energy storage and small-scale renewables including direct participation by customers.\n4.   By 1 January 2021, the imbalance settlement period shall be 15 minutes in all scheduling areas, unless regulatory authorities have granted a derogation or an exemption. Derogations may be granted only until 31 December 2024.\nFrom 1 January 2025, the imbalance settlement period shall not exceed 30 minutes where an exemption has been granted by all the regulatory authorities within a synchronous area.\nArticle 9\nForward markets\n1.   In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1719, transmission system operators shall issue long-term transmission rights or have equivalent measures in place to allow for market participants, including owners of power-generating facilities using renewable energy sources, to hedge price risks across bidding zone borders, unless an assessment of the forward market on the bidding zone borders performed by the competent regulatory authorities shows that there are sufficient hedging opportunities in the concerned bidding zones.\n2.   Long-term transmission rights shall be allocated in a transparent, market based and non-discriminatory manner through a single allocation platform.\n3.   Subject to compliance with Union competition law, market operators shall be free to develop forward hedging products, including long-term forward hedging products, to provide market participants, including owners of power-generating facilities using renewable energy sources, with appropriate possibilities for hedging financial risks against price fluctuations. Member States shall not require that such hedging activity be limited to trades within a Member State or bidding zone.\nArticle 10\nTechnical bidding limits\n1.   There shall be neither a maximum nor a minimum limit to the wholesale electricity price. This provision shall apply, inter alia, to bidding and clearing in all timeframes and shall include balancing energy and imbalance prices, without prejudice to the technical price limits which may be applied in the balancing timeframe and in the day-ahead and intraday timeframes in accordance with paragraph 2.\n2.   NEMOs may apply harmonised limits on maximum and minimum clearing prices for day-ahead and intraday timeframes. Those limits shall be sufficiently high so as not to unnecessarily restrict trade, shall be harmonised for the internal market and shall take into account the maximum value of lost load. NEMOs shall implement a transparent mechanism to adjust automatically the technical bidding limits in due time in the event that the set limits are expected to be reached. The adjusted higher limits shall remain applicable until further increases under that mechanism are required.\n3.   Transmission system operators shall not take any measures for the purpose of changing wholesale prices.\n4.   Regulatory authorities or, where a Member State has designated another competent authority for that purpose, such designated competent authorities, shall identify policies and measures applied within their territory that could contribute to indirectly restricting wholesale price formation, including limiting bids relating to the activation of balancing energy, capacity mechanisms, measures by the transmission system operators, measures intended to challenge market outcomes, or to prevent the abuse of dominant positions or inefficiently defined bidding zones.\n5.   Where a regulatory authority or designated competent authority has identified a policy or measure which could serve to restrict wholesale price formation it shall take all appropriate actions to eliminate or, if not possible, to mitigate the impact of that policy or measure on bidding behaviour. Member States shall provide a report to the Commission by 5 January 2020 detailing the measures and actions they have taken or intend to take.\nArticle 11\nValue of lost load\n1.   By 5 July 2020 where required for the purpose of setting a reliability standard in accordance with Article 25 regulatory authorities or, where a Member State has designated another competent authority for that purpose, such designated competent authorities shall determine a single estimate of the value of lost load for their territory. That estimate shall be made publically available. Regulatory authorities or other designated competent authorities may determine different estimates per bidding zone if they have more than one bidding zone in their territory. Where a bidding zone consists of territories of more than one Member State, the concerned regulatory authorities or other designated competent authorities shall determine a single estimate of the value of lost load for that bidding zone. In determining the single estimate of the value of lost load, regulatory authorities or other designated competent authorities shall apply the methodology referred to in Article 23(6).\n2.   Regulatory authorities and designated competent authorities shall update their estimate of the value of lost load at least every five years, or earlier where they observe a significant change.\nArticle 12\nDispatching of generation and demand response\n1.   The dispatching of power-generating facilities and demand response shall be non-discriminatory, transparent and, unless otherwise provided under paragraphs 2 to 6, market based.\n2.   Without prejudice to Articles 107, 108 and 109 TFEU, Member States shall ensure that when dispatching electricity generating installations, system operators shall give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources to the extent permitted by the secure operation of the national electricity system, based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria and where such power-generating facilities are either:\n(a)\npower-generating facilities that use renewable energy sources and have an installed electricity capacity of less than 400 kW; or\n(b)\ndemonstration projects for innovative technologies, subject to approval by the regulatory authority, provided that such priority is limited to the time and extent necessary for achieving the demonstration purposes.\n3.   A Member State may decide not to apply priority dispatch to power-generating facilities as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 with a start of operation at least six months after that decision, or to apply a lower minimum capacity than that set out under point (a) of paragraph 2, provided that:\n(a)\nit has well-functioning intraday and other wholesale and balancing markets and that those markets are fully accessible to all market participants in accordance with this Regulation;\n(b)\nredispatching rules and congestion management are transparent to all market participants;\n(c)\nthe national contribution of the Member State towards the Union's binding overall target for share of energy from renewable sources under Article 3(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18) and point (a)(2) of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) is at least equal to the corresponding result of the formula set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and the Member State's share of energy from renewable sources is not below its reference points under point (a)(2) of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, or alternatively, the Member State's share of energy from renewable sources in gross final electricity consumption is at least 50 %;\n(d)\nthe Member State has notified the planned derogation to the Commission setting out in detail how the conditions set out under points (a), (b) and (c) are fulfilled; and\n(e)\nthe Member State has published the planned derogation, including the detailed reasoning for the granting of that derogation, taking due account of the protection of commercially sensitive information where required.\nAny derogation shall avoid retroactive changes that affect generating installations already benefiting from priority dispatch, notwithstanding any agreement between a Member State and the operator of a generating installation on a voluntary basis.\nWithout prejudice to Articles 107, 108 and 109 TFEU, Member States may provide incentives to installations eligible for priority dispatch to voluntarily give up priority dispatch.\n4.   Without prejudice to Articles 107, 108 and 109 TFEU, Member States may provide for priority dispatch for electricity generated in power-generating facilities using high-efficiency cogeneration with an installed electricity capacity of less than 400 kW.\n5.   For power-generating facilities commissioned as from 1 January 2026, point (a) of paragraph 2 shall apply only to power-generating facilities that use renewable energy sources and have an installed electricity capacity of less than 200 kW.\n6.   Without prejudice to contracts concluded before 4 July 2019, power-generating facilities that use renewable energy sources or high-efficiency cogeneration and were commissioned before 4 July 2019 and, when commissioned, were subject to priority dispatch under Article 15(5) of Directive 2012/27/EU or Article 16(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) shall continue to benefit from priority dispatch. Priority dispatch shall no longer apply to such power-generating facilities from the date on which the power-generating facility becomes subject to significant modifications, which shall be deemed to be the case at least where a new connection agreement is required or where the generation capacity of the power-generating facility is increased.\n7.   Priority dispatch shall not endanger the secure operation of the electricity system, shall not be used as a justification for curtailment of cross-zonal capacities beyond what is provided for in Article 16 and shall be based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.\nArticle 13\nRedispatching\n1.   The redispatching of generation and redispatching of demand response shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. It shall be open to all generation technologies, all energy storage and all demand response, including those located in other Member States unless technically not feasible.\n2.   The resources that are redispatched shall be selected from among generating facilities, energy storage or demand response using market-based mechanisms and shall be financially compensated. Balancing energy bids used for redispatching shall not set the balancing energy price.\n3.   Non-market-based redispatching of generation, energy storage and demand response may only be used where:\n(a)\nno market-based alternative is available;\n(b)\nall available market-based resources have been used;\n(c)\nthe number of available power generating, energy storage or demand response facilities is too low to ensure effective competition in the area where suitable facilities for the provision of the service are located; or\n(d)\nthe current grid situation leads to congestion in such a regular and predictable way that market-based redispatching would lead to regular strategic bidding which would increase the level of internal congestion and the Member State concerned either has adopted an action plan to address this congestion or ensures that minimum available capacity for cross-zonal trade is in accordance with Article 16(8).\n4.   The transmission system operators and distribution system operators shall report at least annually to the competent regulatory authority, on:\n(a)\nthe level of development and effectiveness of market-based redispatching mechanisms for power generating, energy storage and demand response facilities;\n(b)\nthe reasons, volumes in MWh and type of generation source subject to redispatching;\n(c)\nthe measures taken to reduce the need for the downward redispatching of generating installations using renewable energy sources or high-efficiency cogeneration in the future including investments in digitalisation of the grid infrastructure and in services that increase flexibility.\nThe regulatory authority shall submit the report to ACER and shall publish a summary of the data referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph together with recommendations for improvement where necessary.\n5.   Subject to requirements relating to the maintenance of the reliability and safety of the grid, based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria established by the regulatory authorities, transmission system operators and distribution system operators shall:\n(a)\nguarantee the capability of transmission networks and distribution networks to transmit electricity produced from renewable energy sources or high-efficiency cogeneration with minimum possible redispatching, which shall not prevent network planning from taking into account limited redispatching where the transmission system operator or distribution system operator is able to demonstrate in a transparent way that doing so is more economically efficient and does not exceed 5 % of the annual generated electricity in installations which use renewable energy sources and which are directly connected to their respective grid, unless otherwise provided by a Member State in which electricity from power-generating facilities using renewable energy sources or high-efficiency cogeneration represents more than 50 % of the annual gross final consumption of electricity;\n(b)\ntake appropriate grid-related and market-related operational measures in order to minimise the downward redispatching of electricity produced from renewable energy sources or from high-efficiency cogeneration;\n(c)\nensure that their networks are sufficiently flexible so that they are able to manage them.\n6.   Where non-market-based downward redispatching is used, the following principles shall apply:\n(a)\npower-generating facilities using renewable energy sources shall only be subject to downward redispatching if no other alternative exists or if other solutions would result in significantly disproportionate costs or severe risks to network security;\n(b)\nelectricity generated in a high-efficiency cogeneration process shall only be subject to downward redispatching if, other than downward redispatching of power-generating facilities using renewable energy sources, no other alternative exists or if other solutions would result in disproportionate costs or severe risks to network security;\n(c)\nself-generated electricity from generating installations using renewable energy sources or high-efficiency cogeneration which is not fed into the transmission or distribution network shall not be subject to downward redispatching unless no other solution would resolve network security issues;\n(d)\ndownward redispatching under points (a), (b) and (c)shall be duly and transparently justified. The justification shall be included in the report under paragraph 3.\n7.   Where non-market based redispatching is used, it shall be subject to financial compensation by the system operator requesting the redispatching to the operator of the redispatched generation, energy storage or demand response facility except in the case of producers that have accepted a connection agreement under which there is no guarantee of firm delivery of energy. Such financial compensation shall be at least equal to the higher of the following elements or a combination of both if applying only the higher would lead to an unjustifiably low or an unjustifiably high compensation:\n(a)\nadditional operating cost caused by the redispatching, such as additional fuel costs in the case of upward redispatching, or backup heat provision in the case of downward redispatching of power-generating facilities using high-efficiency cogeneration;\n(b)\nnet revenues from the sale of electricity on the day-ahead market that the power-generating, energy storage or demand response facility would have generated without the redispatching request; where financial support is granted to power-generating, energy storage or demand response facilities based on the electricity volume generated or consumed, financial support that would have been received without the redispatching request shall be deemed to be part of the net revenues.\nCHAPTER III\nNETWORK ACCESS AND CONGESTION MANAGEMENT\nSECTION 1\nCapacity Allocation\nArticle 14\nBidding zone review\n1.   Member States shall take all appropriate measures to address congestions. Bidding zone borders shall be based on long-term, structural congestions in the transmission network. Bidding zones shall not contain such structural congestions unless they have no impact on neighbouring bidding zones, or, as a temporary exemption, their impact on neighbouring bidding zones is mitigated through the use of remedial actions and those structural congestions do not lead to reductions of cross-zonal trading capacity in accordance with the requirements of Article 16. The configuration of bidding zones in the Union shall be designed in such a way as to maximise economic efficiency and to maximise cross-zonal trading opportunities in accordance with Article 16, while maintaining security of supply.\n2.   Every three years, the ENTSO for Electricity shall report on structural congestions and other major physical congestions between and within bidding zones, including the location and frequency of such congestions, in accordance with the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. That report shall contain an assessment of whether the cross-zonal trade capacity reached the linear trajectory pursuant to Article 15 or the minimum capacity pursuant to Article 16 of this Regulation.\n3.   In order to ensure an optimal configuration of bidding zones, a bidding zone review shall be carried out. That review shall identify all structural congestions and shall include an analysis of different configurations of bidding zones in a coordinated manner with the involvement of affected stakeholders from all relevant Member States, in accordance with the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. Current bidding zones shall be assessed on the basis of their ability to create a reliable market environment, including for flexible generation and load capacity, which is crucial to avoiding grid bottlenecks, balancing electricity demand and supply, securing the long-term security of investments in network infrastructure.\n4.   For the purposes of this Article and of Article 15 of this Regulation, relevant Member States, transmission system operators or regulatory authorities are those Member States, transmission system operators or regulatory authorities participating in the review of the bidding zone configuration and also to those in the same capacity calculation region pursuant to the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.\n5.   By 5 October 2019 all relevant transmission system operators shall submit a proposal for the methodology and assumptions that are to be used in the bidding zone review process and for the alternative bidding zone configurations to be considered to the relevant regulatory authorities for approval. The relevant regulatory authorities shall take a unanimous decision on the proposal within 3 months of submission of the proposal. Where the regulatory authorities are unable to reach a unanimous decision on the proposal within that time frame, ACER shall, within an additional three months, decide on the methodology and assumptions and the alternative bidding zone configurations to be considered. The methodology shall be based on structural congestions which are not expected to be overcome within the following three years, taking due account of tangible progress on infrastructure development projects that are expected to be realised within the following three years.\n6.   On the basis of the methodology and assumptions approved pursuant to paragraph 5, the transmission system operators participating in the bidding zone review shall submit a joint proposal to the relevant Member States or their designated competent authorities to amend or maintain the bidding zone configuration no later than 12 months after approval of the methodology and assumptions pursuant to paragraph 5. Other Member States, Energy Community Contracting Parties or other third countries sharing the same synchronous area with any relevant Member State may submit comments.\n7.   Where structural congestion has been identified in the report pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article or in the bidding zone review pursuant to this Article or by one or more transmission system operators in their control areas in a report approved by the competent regulatory authority, the Member State with identified structural congestion shall, in cooperation with its transmission system operators, decide, within six months of receipt of the report, either to establish national or multinational action plans pursuant to Article 15, or to review and amend its bidding zone configuration. Those decisions shall be immediately notified to the Commission and to ACER.\n8.   For those Member States that have opted to amend the bidding zone configuration pursuant to paragraph 7, the relevant Member States shall reach a unanimous decision within six months of the notification referred to in paragraph 7. Other Member States may submit comments to the relevant Member States, who should take account of those comments when reaching their decision. The decision shall be reasoned and shall be notified to the Commission and ACER. In the event that the relevant Member States fail to reach a unanimous decision within those six months, they shall immediately notify the Commission thereof. As a measure of last resort, the Commission after consulting ACER shall adopt a decision whether to amend or maintain the bidding zone configuration in and between those Member States by six months after receipt of such a notification.\n9.   Member States and the Commission shall consult relevant stakeholders before adopting a decision under this Article.\n10.   Any decision adopted under this Article shall specify the date of implementation of any changes. That implementation date shall balance the need for expeditiousness with practical considerations, including forward trade of electricity. The decision may establish appropriate transitional arrangements.\n11.   Where further bidding zone reviews are launched under the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, this Article shall apply.\nArticle 15\nAction plans\n1.   Following the adoption of a decision pursuant to Article 14(7), the Member State with identified structural congestion shall develop an action plan in cooperation with its regulatory authority. That action plan shall contain a concrete timetable for adopting measures to reduce the structural congestions identified within four years of the adoption of the decision pursuant to Article 14(7).\n2.   Irrespective of the concrete progress of the action plan, Member States shall ensure that without prejudice to derogations granted under Article 16(9) or deviations under Article 16(3), the cross-zonal trade capacity is increased on an annual basis until the minimum capacity provided for in Article 16(8) is reached. That minimum capacity shall be reached by 31 December 2025.\nThose annual increases shall be achieved by means of a linear trajectory. The starting point of that trajectory shall be either the capacity allocated at the border or on a critical network element in the year before adoption of the action plan or the average during the three years before adoption of the action plan, whichever is higher. Member States shall ensure that, during the implementation of their action plans the capacity made available for cross-zonal trade to be compliant with Article 16(8) is at least equal to the values of the linear trajectory, including by use of remedial actions in the capacity calculation region.\n3.   The cost of the remedial actions necessary to achieve the linear trajectory referred to in paragraph 2 or make available cross-zonal capacity at the borders or on critical network elements concerned by the action plan shall be borne by the Member State or Member States implementing the action plan.\n4.   On an annual basis, during the implementation of the action plan and within six months of its expiry, the relevant transmission system operators shall assess for the previous 12 months whether the available cross-border capacity has reached the linear trajectory or, from 1 January 2026, the minimum capacities provided for in Article 16(8) have been achieved. They shall submit their assessments to ACER and to the relevant regulatory authorities. Before drafting the report, each transmission system operator shall submit its contribution to the report, including all the relevant data, to its regulatory authority for approval.\n5.   For those Member States for which the assessments referred to in paragraph 4 demonstrate that a transmission system operator has not complied with the linear trajectory, the relevant Member States shall, within six months of receipt of the assessment report referred to in paragraph 4, decide unanimously whether to amend or maintain the bidding zone configuration within and between those Member States. In their decision, the relevant Member States should take account of any comments submitted by other Member States. The relevant Member States' decision shall be substantiated and shall be notified to the Commission and to ACER.\nThe relevant Member States shall notify the Commission immediately if they fail to reach a unanimous decision within the timeframe laid down. Within six months of receipt of such notification, the Commission, as a last resort and after consulting ACER and the relevant stakeholders shall adopt a decision whether to amend or maintain the bidding zone configuration in and between those Member States.\n6.   Six months before the expiry of the action plan, the Member State with identified structural congestion shall decide whether to address remaining congestion by amending its bidding zone or whether to address remaining internal congestion with remedial actions for which it shall cover the costs.\n7.   Where no action plan is established within six months of identification of structural congestion pursuant to Article 14(7), the relevant transmission system operators shall, within 12 months of identification of such structural congestion, assess whether the available cross-border capacity has reached the minimum capacities provided for in Article 16(8) during the previous 12 months and shall submit an assessment report to the relevant regulatory authorities and to ACER.\nBefore drafting the report, each transmission system operator shall send its contribution to the report, including all relevant data, to its national regulatory authority for approval. Where the assessment demonstrates that a transmission system operator has not complied with the minimum capacity, the decision-making process laid down in paragraph 5 of this Article shall apply.\nArticle 16\nGeneral principles of capacity allocation and congestion management\n1.   Network congestion problems shall be addressed with non-discriminatory market-based solutions which give efficient economic signals to the market participants and transmission system operators involved. Network congestion problems shall be solved by means of non-transaction-based methods, namely methods that do not involve a selection between the contracts of individual market participants. When taking operational measures to ensure that its transmission system remains in the normal state, the transmission system operator shall take into account the effect of those measures on neighbouring control areas and coordinate such measures with other affected transmission system operators as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2015/1222.\n2.   Transaction curtailment procedures shall be used only in emergency situations, namely where the transmission system operator must act in an expeditious manner and redispatching or countertrading is not possible. Any such procedure shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Except in cases of force majeure, market participants that have been allocated capacity shall be compensated for any such curtailment.\n3.   Regional coordination centres shall carry out coordinated capacity calculation in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 8 of this Article, as provided for in point (a) of Article 37(1) and in Article 42(1).\nRegional coordination centres shall calculate cross-zonal capacities respecting operational security limits using data from transmission system operators including data on the technical availability of remedial actions, not including load shedding. Where regional coordination centres conclude that those available remedial actions in the capacity calculation region or between capacity calculation regions are not sufficient to reach the linear trajectory pursuant to Article 15(2) or the minimum capacities provided for in paragraph 8 of this Article while respecting operational security limits, they may, as a measure of last resort, set out coordinated actions reducing the cross-zonal capacities accordingly. Transmission system operators may deviate from coordinated actions in respect of coordinated capacity calculation and coordinated security analysis only in accordance with Article 42(2).\nBy 3 months after the entry into operation of the regional coordination centres pursuant to Article 35(2) of this Regulation and every three months thereafter, the regional coordination centres shall submit a report to the relevant regulatory authorities and to ACER on any reduction of capacity or deviation from coordinated actions pursuant to the second subparagraph and shall assess the incidences and make recommendations, if necessary, on how to avoid such deviations in the future. If ACER concludes that the prerequisites for a deviation pursuant to this paragraph are not fulfilled or are of a structural nature, ACER shall submit an opinion to the relevant regulatory authorities and to the Commission. The competent regulatory authorities shall take appropriate action against transmission system operators or regional coordination centres pursuant to Article 59 or 62 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 if the prerequisites for a deviation pursuant to this paragraph were not fulfilled.\nDeviations of a structural nature shall be addressed in an action plan referred to in Article 14(7) or in an update of an existing action plan.\n4.   The maximum level of capacity of the interconnections and the transmission networks affected by cross-border capacity shall be made available to market participants complying with the safety standards of secure network operation. Counter-trading and redispatch, including cross-border redispatch, shall be used to maximise available capacities to reach the minimum capacity provided for in paragraph 8. A coordinated and non-discriminatory process for cross-border remedial actions shall be applied to enable such maximisation, following the implementation of a redispatching and counter-trading cost-sharing methodology.\n5.   Capacity shall be allocated by means of explicit capacity auctions or implicit auctions including both capacity and energy. Both methods may coexist on the same interconnection. For intraday trade, continuous trading, which may be complemented by auctions, shall be used.\n6.   In the case of congestion, the valid highest value bids for network capacity, whether implicit or explicit, offering the highest value for the scarce transmission capacity in a given timeframe, shall be successful. Other than in the case of new interconnectors which benefit from an exemption under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 or Article 63 of this Regulation, establishing reserve prices in capacity-allocation methods shall be prohibited.\n7.   Capacity shall be freely tradable on a secondary basis, provided that the transmission system operator is informed sufficiently in advance. Where a transmission system operator refuses any secondary trade (transaction), this shall be clearly and transparently communicated and explained to all the market participants by that transmission system operator and notified to the regulatory authority.\n8.   Transmission system operators shall not limit the volume of interconnection capacity to be made available to market participants as a means of solving congestion inside their own bidding zone or as a means of managing flows resulting from transactions internal to bidding zones. Without prejudice to the application of the derogations under paragraphs 3 and 9 of this Article and to the application of Article 15(2), this paragraph shall be considered to be complied with where the following minimum levels of available capacity for cross-zonal trade are reached:\n(a)\nfor borders using a coordinated net transmission capacity approach, the minimum capacity shall be 70 % of the transmission capacity respecting operational security limits after deduction of contingencies, as determined in accordance with the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009;\n(b)\nfor borders using a flow-based approach, the minimum capacity shall be a margin set in the capacity calculation process as available for flows induced by cross-zonal exchange. The margin shall be 70 % of the capacity respecting operational security limits of internal and cross-zonal critical network elements, taking into account contingencies, as determined in accordance with the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.\nThe total amount of 30 % can be used for the reliability margins, loop flows and internal flows on each critical network element.\n9.   At the request of the transmission system operators in a capacity calculation region, the relevant regulatory authorities may grant a derogation from paragraph 8 on foreseeable grounds where necessary for maintaining operational security. Such derogations, which shall not relate to the curtailment of capacities already allocated pursuant to paragraph 2, shall be granted for no more than one-year at a time, or, provided that the extent of the derogation decreases significantly after the first year, up to a maximum of two years. The extent of such derogations shall be strictly limited to what is necessary to maintain operational security and they shall avoid discrimination between internal and cross-zonal exchanges.\nBefore granting a derogation, the relevant regulatory authority shall consult the regulatory authorities of other Member States forming part of the affected capacity calculation regions. Where a regulatory authority disagrees with the proposed derogation, ACER shall decide whether it should be granted pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(10) of Regulation (EU) 2019/942. The justification and reasons for the derogation shall be published.\nWhere a derogation is granted, the relevant transmission system operators shall develop and publish a methodology and projects that shall provide a long-term solution to the issue that the derogation seeks to address. The derogation shall expire when the time limit for the derogation is reached or when the solution is applied, whichever is earlier.\n10.   Market participants shall inform the transmission system operators concerned within a reasonable period in advance of the relevant operational period whether they intend to use allocated capacity. Any allocated capacity that is not going to be used shall be made available again to the market, in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.\n11.   As far as technically possible, transmission system operators shall net the capacity requirements of any power flows in opposite directions over the congested interconnection line in order to use that line to its maximum capacity. Having full regard to network security, transactions that relieve the congestion shall not be refused.\n12.   The financial consequences of a failure to honour obligations associated with the allocation of capacity shall be attributed to the transmission system operators or NEMOs who are responsible for such a failure. Where market participants fail to use the capacity that they have committed to use, or, in the case of explicitly auctioned capacity, fail to trade capacity on a secondary basis or give the capacity back in due time, those market participants shall lose the rights to such capacity and shall pay a cost-reflective charge. Any cost-reflective charges for the failure to use capacity shall be justified and proportionate. If a transmission system operator does not fulfil its obligation of providing firm transmission capacity, it shall be liable to compensate the market participant for the loss of capacity rights. Consequential losses shall not be taken into account for that purpose. The key concepts and methods for the determination of liabilities that accrue upon failure to honour obligations shall be set out in advance in respect of the financial consequences, and shall be subject to review by the relevant regulatory authority.\n13.   When allocating costs of remedial actions between transmission system operators, regulatory authorities shall analyse to what extent flows resulting from transactions internal to bidding zones contribute to the congestion between two bidding zones observed, and allocate the costs based on the contribution to the congestion to the transmission system operators of the bidding zones creating such flows except for costs induced by flows resulting from transactions internal to bidding zones that are below the level that could be expected without structural congestion in a bidding zone.\nThat level shall be jointly analysed and defined by all transmission system operators in a capacity calculation region for each individual bidding zone border, and shall be subject to the approval of all regulatory authorities in the capacity calculation region.\nArticle 17\nAllocation of cross-zonal capacity across timeframes\n1.   Transmission system operators shall recalculate available cross-zonal capacity at least after day-ahead gate closure times and after intraday cross-zonal gate closure times. Transmission system operators shall allocate the available cross-zonal capacity plus any remaining cross-zonal capacity not previously allocated and any cross-zonal capacity released by physical transmission right holders from previous allocations in the following cross-zonal capacity allocation process.\n2.   Transmission system operators shall propose an appropriate structure for the allocation of cross-zonal capacity across timeframes, including day-ahead, intraday and balancing. That allocation structure shall be subject to review by the relevant regulatory authorities. In drawing up their proposal, the transmission system operators shall take into account:\n(a)\nthe characteristics of the markets;\n(b)\nthe operational conditions of the electricity system, such as the implications of netting firmly declared schedules;\n(c)\nthe level of harmonisation of the percentages allocated to different timeframes and the timeframes adopted for the different cross-zonal capacity allocation mechanisms that are already in place.\n3.   Where cross-zonal capacity is available after the intraday cross-zonal gate closure time, transmission system operators shall use the cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing energy or for the operation of the imbalance netting process.\n4.   Where cross-zonal capacity is allocated for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves pursuant to Article 6(8) of this Regulation, transmission system operators shall use the methodologies developed in the guideline on electricity balancing adopted on the basis of Article 6(11) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.\n5.   Transmission system operators shall not increase the reliability margin calculated pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 due to the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves.\nSECTION 2\nNetwork charges and congestion income\nArticle 18\nCharges for access to networks, use of networks and reinforcement\n1.   Charges applied by network operators for access to networks, including charges for connection to the networks, charges for use of networks, and, where applicable, charges for related network reinforcements, shall be cost-reflective, transparent, take into account the need for network security and flexibility and reflect actual costs incurred insofar as they correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable network operator and are applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Those charges shall not include unrelated costs supporting unrelated policy objectives.\nWithout prejudice to Article 15(1) and (6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and the criteria in Annex XI to that Directive the method used to determine the network charges shall neutrally support overall system efficiency over the long run through price signals to customers and producers and in particular be applied in a way which does not discriminate positively or negatively between production connected at the distribution level and production connected at the transmission level. The network charges shall not discriminate either positively or negatively against energy storage or aggregation and shall not create disincentives for self-generation, self-consumption or for participation in demand response. Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, those charges shall not be distance-related.\n2.   Tariff methodologies shall reflect the fixed costs of transmission system operators and distribution system operators and shall provide appropriate incentives to transmission system operators and distribution system operators over both the short and long run, in order to increase efficiencies, including energy efficiency, to foster market integration and security of supply, to support efficient investments, to support related research activities, and to facilitate innovation in interest of consumers in areas such as digitalisation, flexibility services and interconnection.\n3.   Where appropriate, the level of the tariffs applied to producers or final customers, or both shall provide locational signals at Union level, and take into account the amount of network losses and congestion caused, and investment costs for infrastructure.\n4.   When setting the charges for network access, the following shall be taken into account:\n(a)\npayments and receipts resulting from the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism;\n(b)\nactual payments made and received as well as payments expected for future periods, estimated on the basis of previous periods.\n5.   Setting the charges for network access under this Article shall be without prejudice to charges resulting from congestion management referred to in Article 16.\n6.   There shall be no specific network charge on individual transactions for cross-zonal trading of electricity.\n7.   Distribution tariffs shall be cost-reflective taking into account the use of the distribution network by system users including active customers. Distribution tariffs may contain network connection capacity elements and may be differentiated based on system users' consumption or generation profiles. Where Member States have implemented the deployment of smart metering systems, regulatory authorities shall consider time-differentiated network tariffs when fixing or approving transmission tariffs and distribution tariffs or their methodologies in accordance with Article 59 of (EU) 2019/944 and, where appropriate, time-differentiated network tariffs may be introduced to reflect the use of the network, in a transparent, cost efficient and foreseeable way for the final customer.\n8.   Distribution tariff methodologies shall provide incentives to distribution system operators for the most cost-efficient operation and development of their networks including through the procurement of services. For that purpose regulatory authorities shall recognise relevant costs as eligible, shall include those costs in distribution tariffs, and may introduce performance targets in order to provide incentives to distribution system operators to increase efficiencies in their networks, including through energy efficiency, flexibility and the development of smart grids and intelligent metering systems.\n9.   By 5 October 2019 in order to mitigate the risk of market fragmentation ACER shall provide a best practice report on transmission and distribution tariff methodologies while taking account of national specificities. That best practice report shall address at least:\n(a)\nthe ratio of tariffs applied to producers and tariffs applied to final customers;\n(b)\nthe costs to be recovered by tariffs;\n(c)\ntime-differentiated network tariffs;\n(d)\nlocational signals;\n(e)\nthe relationship between transmission tariffs and distribution tariffs;\n(f)\nmethods to ensure transparency in the setting and structure of tariffs;\n(g)\ngroups of network users subject to tariffs including, where applicable, the characteristics of those groups, forms of consumption, and any tariff exemptions;\n(h)\nlosses in high, medium and low-voltage grids.\nACER shall update the best practice report at least once every two years.\n10.   Regulatory authorities shall duly take the best practice report into consideration when fixing or approving transmission tariffs and distribution tariffs or their methodologies in accordance with Article 59 of Directive (EU) 2019/944.\nArticle 19\nCongestion income\n1.   Congestion-management procedures associated with a pre-specified timeframe may generate revenue only in the event of congestion which arises for that timeframe, except in the case of new interconnectors which benefit from an exemption under Article 63 of this Regulation, Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 or Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003. The procedure for the distribution of those revenues shall be subject to review by the regulatory authorities and shall neither distort the allocation process in favour of any party requesting capacity or energy nor provide a disincentive to reduce congestion.\n2.   The following objectives shall have priority with the respect to the allocation of any revenues resulting from the allocation of cross-zonal capacity:\n(a)\nguaranteeing the actual availability of the allocated capacity including firmness compensation; or\n(b)\nmaintaining or increasing cross-zonal capacities through optimisation of the usage of existing interconnectors by means of coordinated remedial actions, where applicable, or covering costs resulting from network investments that are relevant to reduce interconnector congestion.\n3.   Where the priority objectives set out in paragraph 2 have been adequately fulfilled, the revenues may be used as income to be taken into account by the regulatory authorities when approving the methodology for calculating network tariffs or fixing network tariffs, or both. The residual revenues shall be placed on a separate internal account line until such a time as it can be spent for the purposes set out in paragraph 2.\n4.   The use of revenues in accordance with point (a) or (b) of paragraph 2 shall be subject to a methodology proposed by the transmission system operators after consulting regulatory authorities and relevant stakeholders and after approval by ACER. The transmission system operators shall submit the proposed methodology to ACER by 5 July 2020 and ACER shall decide on the proposed methodology within six months of receiving it.\nACER may request transmission system operators to amend or update the methodology referred to in the first subparagraph. ACER shall decide on the amended or updated methodology not later than six months after its submission.\nThe methodology shall set out at least the conditions under which the revenues can be used for the purposes referred to in paragraph 2, the conditions under which those revenues may be placed on a separate internal account line for future use for those purposes, and for how long those revenues may be placed on such an account line.\n5.   Transmission system operators shall clearly establish, in advance, how any congestion income will be used, and shall report to the regulatory authorities on the actual use of that income. By 1 March each year, the regulatory authorities shall inform ACER and shall publish a report setting out:\n(a)\nthe amount of revenue collected for the 12-month period ending on 31 December of the previous year;\n(b)\nhow that revenue was used pursuant to paragraph 2, including the specific projects the income has been used for, and the amount placed on a separate account line;\n(c)\nthe amount that was used when calculating network tariffs; and\n(d)\nverification that the amount referred to in point (c) complies with this Regulation and the methodology developed pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4.\nWhere some of the congestion revenues are used when calculating network tariffs, the report shall set out how the transmission system operators fulfilled the priority objectives set out in paragraph 2 where applicable.\nCHAPTER IV\nRESOURCE ADEQUACY\nArticle 20\nResource adequacy in the internal market for electricity\n1.   Member States shall monitor resource adequacy within their territory on the basis of the European resource adequacy assessment referred to in Article 23. For the purpose of complementing the European resource adequacy assessment, Member States may also carry out national resource adequacy assessments pursuant to Article 24.\n2.   Where the European resource adequacy assessment referred to in Article 23 or national resource adequacy assessment referred to in Article 24 identifies a resource adequacy concern, the Member State concerned shall identify any regulatory distortions or market failures that caused or contributed to the emergence of the concern.\n3.   Member States with identified resource adequacy concerns shall develop and publish an implementation plan with a timeline for adopting measures to eliminate any identified regulatory distortions or market failures as a part of the State aid process. When addressing resource adequacy concerns, the Member States shall in particular take into account the principles set out in Article 3 and shall consider:\n(a)\nremoving regulatory distortions;\n(b)\nremoving price caps in accordance with Article 10;\n(c)\nintroducing a shortage pricing function for balancing energy as referred to in Article 44(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195;\n(d)\nincreasing interconnection and internal grid capacity with a view to reaching at least their interconnection targets as referred in point (d)(1) of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999;\n(e)\nenabling self-generation, energy storage, demand side measures and energy efficiency by adopting measures to eliminate any identified regulatory distortions;\n(f)\nensuring cost-efficient and market-based procurement of balancing and ancillary services;\n(g)\nremoving regulated prices where required by Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/944.\n4.   The Member States concerned shall submit their implementation plans to the Commission for review.\n5.   Within four months of receipt of the implementation plan, the Commission shall issue an opinion on whether the measures are sufficient to eliminate the regulatory distortions or market failures that were identified pursuant to paragraph 2, and may invite the Member States to amend their implementation plans accordingly.\n6.   The Member States concerned shall monitor the application of their implementation plans and shall publish the results of the monitoring in an annual report and shall submit that report to the Commission.\n7.   The Commission shall issue an opinion on whether the implementation plans have been sufficiently implemented and whether the resource adequacy concern has been resolved.\n8.   Member States shall continue to adhere to the implementation plan after the identified resource adequacy concern has been resolved.\nArticle 21\nGeneral principles for capacity mechanisms\n1.   To eliminate residual resource adequacy concerns, Member States may, as a last resort while implementing the measures referred to in Article 20(3) of this Regulation in accordance with Article 107, 108 and 109 of the TFEU, introduce capacity mechanisms.\n2.   Before introducing capacity mechanisms, the Member States concerned shall conduct a comprehensive study of the possible effects of such mechanisms on the neighbouring Member States by consulting at least its neighbouring Member States to which they have a direct network connection and the stakeholders of those Member States.\n3.   Member States shall assess whether a capacity mechanism in the form of strategic reserve is capable of addressing the resource adequacy concerns. Where this is not the case, Member States may implement a different type of capacity mechanism.\n4.   Member States shall not introduce capacity mechanisms where both the European resource adequacy assessment and the national resource adequacy assessment, or in the absence of a national resource adequacy assessment, the European resource adequacy assessment have not identified a resource adequacy concern.\n5.   Member States shall not introduce capacity mechanisms before the implementation plan as referred to in Article 20(3) has received an opinion by the Commission as referred to in Article 20(5).\n6.   Where a Member State applies a capacity mechanism, it shall review that capacity mechanism and shall ensure that no new contracts are concluded under that mechanism where both the European resource adequacy assessment and the national resource adequacy assessment, or in the absence of a national resource adequacy assessment, the European resource adequacy assessment have not identified a resource adequacy concern or the implementation plan as referred to in Article 20(3) has not received an opinion by the Commission as referred to in Article 20(5).\n7.   When designing capacity mechanisms Member States shall include a provision allowing for an efficient administrative phase-out of the capacity mechanism where no new contracts are concluded under paragraph 6 during three consecutive years.\n8.   Capacity mechanisms shall be temporary. They shall be approved by the Commission for no longer than 10 years. They shall be phased out or the amount of the committed capacities shall be reduced on the basis of the implementation plans referred to in Article 20. Member States shall continue to apply the implementation plan after the introduction of the capacity mechanism.\nArticle 22\nDesign principles for capacity mechanisms\n1.   Any capacity mechanism shall:\n(a)\nbe temporary;\n(b)\nnot create undue market distortions and not limit cross-zonal trade;\n(c)\nnot go beyond what is necessary to address the adequacy concerns referred to in Article 20;\n(d)\nselect capacity providers by means of a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitive process;\n(e)\nprovide incentives for capacity providers to be available in times of expected system stress;\n(f)\nensure that the remuneration is determined through the competitive process;\n(g)\nset out the technical conditions for the participation of capacity providers in advance of the selection process;\n(h)\nbe open to participation of all resources that are capable of providing the required technical performance, including energy storage and demand side management;\n(i)\napply appropriate penalties to capacity providers that are not available in times of system stress.\n2.   The design of strategic reserves shall meet the following requirements:\n(a)\nwhere a capacity mechanism has been designed as a strategic reserve, the resources thereof are to be dispatched only if the transmission system operators are likely to exhaust their balancing resources to establish an equilibrium between demand and supply;\n(b)\nduring imbalance settlement periods where resources in the strategic reserve are dispatched, imbalances in the market are to be settled at least at the value of lost load or at a higher value than the intraday technical price limit as referred in Article 10(1), whichever is higher;\n(c)\nthe output of the strategic reserve following dispatch is to be attributed to balance responsible parties through the imbalance settlement mechanism;\n(d)\nthe resources taking part in the strategic reserve are not to receive remuneration from the wholesale electricity markets or from the balancing markets;\n(e)\nthe resources in the strategic reserve are to be held outside the market for at least the duration of the contractual period.\nThe requirement referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the activation of resources before actual dispatch in order to respect the ramping constraints and operating requirements of the resources. The output of the strategic reserve during activation shall not be attributed to balance groups through wholesale markets and shall not change their imbalances.\n3.   In addition to the requirements laid down in paragraph 1, capacity mechanisms other than strategic reserves shall:\n(a)\nbe constructed so as to ensure that the price paid for availability automatically tends to zero when the level of capacity supplied is expected to be adequate to meet the level of capacity demanded;\n(b)\nremunerate the participating resources only for their availability and ensure that the remuneration does not affect decisions of the capacity provider on whether or not to generate;\n(c)\nensure that capacity obligations are transferable between eligible capacity providers.\n4.   Capacity mechanisms shall incorporate the following requirements regarding CO2 emission limits:\n(a)\nfrom 4 July 2019 at the latest, generation capacity that started commercial production on or after that date and that emits more than 550 g of CO2 of fossil fuel origin per kWh of electricity shall not be committed or to receive payments or commitments for future payments under a capacity mechanism;\n(b)\nfrom 1 July 2025 at the latest, generation capacity that started commercial production before 4 July 2019 and that emits more than 550 g of CO2 of fossil fuel origin per kWh of electricity and more than 350 kg CO2 of fossil fuel origin on average per year per installed kWe shall not be committed or receive payments or commitments for future payments under a capacity mechanism.\nThe emission limit of 550 g CO2 of fossil fuel origin per kWh of electricity and the limit of 350 kg CO2 of fossil fuel origin on average per year per installed kWe referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph shall be calculated on the basis of the design efficiency of the generation unit meaning the net efficiency at nominal capacity under the relevant standards provided for by the International Organization for Standardization.\nBy 5 January 2020, ACER shall publish an opinion providing technical guidance related to the calculation of the values referred in the first subparagraph.\n5.   Member States that apply capacity mechanisms on 4 July 2019 shall adapt their mechanisms to comply with Chapter 4 without prejudice to commitments or contracts concluded by 31 December 2019.\nArticle 23\nEuropean resource adequacy assessment\n1.   The European resource adequacy assessment shall identify resource adequacy concerns by assessing the overall adequacy of the electricity system to supply current and projected demands for electricity at Union level, at the level of the Member States, and at the level of individual bidding zones, where relevant. The European resource adequacy assessment shall cover each year within a period of 10 years from the date of that assessment.\n2.   The European resource adequacy assessment shall be conducted by the ENTSO for Electricity.\n3.   By 5 January 2020, the ENTSO for Electricity shall submit to the Electricity Coordination Group set up under Article 1 of Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 (21) and ACER a draft methodology for the European resource adequacy assessment based on the principles provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article.\n4.   Transmission system operators shall provide the ENTSO for Electricity with the data it needs to carry out the European resource adequacy assessment.\nThe ENTSO for Electricity shall carry out the European resource adequacy assessment on an annual basis. Producers and other market participants shall provide transmission system operators with data regarding expected utilisation of the generation resources, taking into account the availability of primary resources and appropriate scenarios of projected demand and supply.\n5.   The European resource adequacy assessment shall be based on a transparent methodology which shall ensure that the assessment:\n(a)\nis carried out on each bidding zone level covering at least all Member States;\n(b)\nis based on appropriate central reference scenarios of projected demand and supply including an economic assessment of the likelihood of retirement, mothballing, new-build of generation assets and measures to reach energy efficiency and electricity interconnection targets and appropriate sensitivities on extreme weather events, hydrological conditions, wholesale prices and carbon price developments;\n(c)\ncontains separate scenarios reflecting the differing likelihoods of the occurrence of resource adequacy concerns which the different types of capacity mechanisms are designed to address;\n(d)\nappropriately takes account of the contribution of all resources including existing and future possibilities for generation, energy storage, sectoral integration, demand response, and import and export and their contribution to flexible system operation;\n(e)\nanticipates the likely impact of the measures referred in Article 20(3);\n(f)\nincludes variants without existing or planned capacity mechanisms and, where applicable, variants with such mechanisms;\n(g)\nis based on a market model using the flow-based approach, where applicable;\n(h)\napplies probabilistic calculations;\n(i)\napplies a single modelling tool;\n(j)\nincludes at least the following indicators referred to in Article 25:\n—\n‘expected energy not served’, and\n—\n‘loss of load expectation’;\n(k)\nidentifies the sources of possible resource adequacy concerns, in particular whether it is a network constraint, a resource constraint, or both;\n(l)\ntakes into account real network development;\n(m)\nensures that the national characteristics of generation, demand flexibility and energy storage, the availability of primary resources and the level of interconnection are properly taken into consideration.\n6.   By 5 January 2020, the ENTSO for Electricity shall submit to ACER a draft methodology for calculating:\n(a)\nthe value of lost load;\n(b)\nthe cost of new entry for generation, or demand response; and\n(c)\nthe reliability standard referred to in Article 25.\nThe methodology shall be based on transparent, objective and verifiable criteria.\n7.   The proposals under paragraphs 3 and 6 for the draft methodology, the scenarios, sensitivities and assumptions on which they are based, and the results of the European resource adequacy assessment under paragraph 4 shall be subject to the prior consultation of Member States, the Electricity Coordination Group and relevant stakeholders and approval by ACER under the procedure set out in Article 27.\nArticle 24\nNational resource adequacy assessments\n1.   National resource adequacy assessments shall have a regional scope and shall be based on the methodology referred in Article 23(3) in particular in points (b) to (m) of Article 23(5).\nNational resource adequacy assessments shall contain the reference central scenarios as referred to in point (b) of Article 23(5).\nNational resource adequacy assessments may take into account additional sensitivities to those referred in point (b) of Article 23(5). In such cases, national resource adequacy assessments may:\n(a)\nmake assumptions taking into account the particularities of national electricity demand and supply;\n(b)\nuse tools and consistent recent data that are complementary to those used by the ENTSO for Electricity for the European resource adequacy assessment.\nIn addition, the national resource adequacy assessments, in assessing the contribution of capacity providers located in another Member State to the security of supply of the bidding zones that they cover, shall use the methodology as provided for in point (a) of Article 26(11).\n2.   National resource adequacy assessments and, where applicable, the European resource adequacy assessment and the opinion of ACER pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be made publicly available.\n3.   Where the national resource adequacy assessment identifies an adequacy concern with regard to a bidding zone that was not identified in the European resource adequacy assessment, the national resource adequacy assessment shall include the reasons for the divergence between the two resource adequacy assessments, including details of the sensitivities used and the underlying assumptions. Member States shall publish that assessment and submit it to ACER.\nWithin two months of the date of the receipt of the report, ACER shall provide an opinion on whether the differences between the national resource adequacy assessment and the European resource adequacy assessment are justified.\nThe body that is responsible for the national resource adequacy assessment shall take due account of ACER's opinion, and where necessary shall amend its assessment. Where it decides not to take ACER's opinion fully into account, the body that is responsible for the national resource adequacy assessment shall publish a report with detailed reasons.\nArticle 25\nReliability standard\n1.   When applying capacity mechanisms Member States shall have a reliability standard in place. A reliability standard shall indicate the necessary level of security of supply of the Member State in a transparent manner. In the case of cross-border bidding zones, such reliability standards shall be established jointly by the relevant authorities.\n2.   The reliability standard shall be set by the Member State or by a competent authority designated by the Member State, following a proposal by the regulatory authority. The reliability standard shall be based on the methodology set out in Article 23(6).\n3.   The reliability standard shall be calculated using at least the value of lost load and the cost of new entry over a given timeframe and shall be expressed as ‘expected energy not served’ and ‘loss of load expectation’.\n4.   When applying capacity mechanisms, the parameters determining the amount of capacity procured in the capacity mechanism shall be approved by the Member State or by a competent authority designated by the Member State, on the basis of a proposal of the regulatory authority.\nArticle 26\nCross-border participation in capacity mechanisms\n1.   Capacity mechanisms other than strategic reserves and where technically feasible, strategic reserves shall be open to direct cross-border participation of capacity providers located in another Member State, subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that foreign capacity capable of providing equivalent technical performance to domestic capacities has the opportunity to participate in the same competitive process as domestic capacity. In the case of capacity mechanisms in operation on 4 July 2019, Member States may allow interconnectors to participate directly in the same competitive process as foreign capacity for a maximum of four years from 4 July 2019 or two years after the date of approval of the methodologies referred to in paragraph 11, whichever is earlier.\nMember States may require foreign capacity to be located in a Member State that has a direct network connection with the Member State applying the mechanism.\n3.   Member States shall not prevent capacity which is located in their territory from participating in capacity mechanisms of other Member States.\n4.   Cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms shall not change, alter or otherwise affect cross-zonal schedules or physical flows between Member States. Those schedules and flows shall be determined solely by the outcome of capacity allocation pursuant to Article 16.\n5.   Capacity providers shall be able to participate in more than one capacity mechanism.\nWhere capacity providers participate in more than one capacity mechanism for the same delivery period, they shall participate up to the expected availability of interconnection and the likely concurrence of system stress between the system where the mechanism is applied and the system in which the foreign capacity is located, in accordance with the methodology referred to in point (a) of paragraph 11.\n6.   Capacity providers shall be required to make non-availability payments where their capacity is not available.\nWhere capacity providers participate in more than one capacity mechanism for the same delivery period, they shall be required to make multiple non-availability payments where they are unable to fulfil multiple commitments.\n7.   For the purposes of providing a recommendation to transmission system operators, regional coordination centres established pursuant to Article 35 shall calculate on an annual basis the maximum entry capacity available for the participation of foreign capacity. That calculation shall take into account the expected availability of interconnection and the likely concurrence of system stress in the system where the mechanism is applied and the system in which the foreign capacity is located. Such a calculation shall be required for each bidding zone border.\nTransmission system operators shall set the maximum entry capacity available for the participation of foreign capacity based on the recommendation of the regional coordination centre on an annual basis.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that the entry capacity referred to in paragraph 7 is allocated to eligible capacity providers in a transparent, non-discriminatory and market-based manner.\n9.   Where capacity mechanisms allow for cross-border participation in two neighbouring Member States, any revenues arising through the allocation referred to in paragraph 8 shall accrue to the transmission system operators concerned and shall be shared between them in accordance with the methodology referred in point (b) of paragraph 11 of this Article or in accordance with a common methodology approved by both relevant regulatory authorities. If the neighbouring Member State does not apply a capacity mechanism or applies a capacity mechanism which is not open to cross-border participation, the share of revenues shall be approved by the competent national authority of the Member State in which the capacity mechanism is implemented after having sought the opinion of the regulatory authorities of the neighbouring Member States. Transmission system operators shall use such revenues for the purposes set out in Article 19(2).\n10.   The transmission system operator where the foreign capacity is located shall:\n(a)\nestablish whether interested capacity providers can provide the technical performance as required by the capacity mechanism in which the capacity provider intends to participate, and register that capacity provider as an eligible capacity provider in a registry set up for that purpose;\n(b)\ncarry out availability checks;\n(c)\nnotify the transmission system operator in the Member State applying the capacity mechanism of the information it acquires under points (a) and (b) of this subparagraph and the second subparagraph.\nThe relevant capacity provider shall notify the transmission system operator of its participation in a foreign capacity mechanism without delay.\n11.   By 5 July 2020 the ENTSO for Electricity shall submit to ACER:\n(a)\na methodology for calculating the maximum entry capacity for cross-border participation as referred to in paragraph 7;\n(b)\na methodology for sharing the revenues referred to in paragraph 9;\n(c)\ncommon rules for the carrying out of availability checks referred to in point (b) of paragraph 10;\n(d)\ncommon rules for determining when a non-availability payment is due;\n(e)\nterms of the operation of the registry as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 10;\n(f)\ncommon rules for identifying capacity eligible to participate in the capacity mechanism as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 10.\nThe proposal shall be subject to prior consultation and approval by ACER in accordance with Article 27.\n12.   The regulatory authorities concerned shall verify whether the capacities have been calculated in accordance with the methodology referred to in point (a) of paragraph 11.\n13.   Regulatory authorities shall ensure that cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms is organised in an effective and non-discriminatory manner. They shall in particular provide for adequate administrative arrangements for the enforcement of non-availability payments across borders.\n14.   The capacities allocated in accordance with paragraph 8 shall be transferable between eligible capacity providers. Eligible capacity providers shall notify the registry as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 10 of any such transfer.\n15.   By 5 July 2021 the ENTSO for Electricity shall set up and operate the registry referred to in point (a) of paragraph 10. The registry shall be open to all eligible capacity providers, the systems implementing capacity mechanisms and their transmission system operators.\nArticle 27\nApproval procedure\n1.   Where reference is made to this Article, the procedure set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall apply to the approval of proposals submitted by the ENTSO for Electricity.\n2.   Before submitting a proposal, the ENTSO for Electricity shall carry out a consultation involving all relevant stakeholders, including regulatory authorities and other national authorities. It shall duly take the results of that consultation into consideration in its proposal.\n3.   Within three months of the date of receipt of the proposal referred to in paragraph 1, ACER shall either approve or amend it. In the latter case, ACER shall consult the ENTSO for Electricity before approving the amended proposal. ACER shall publish the approved proposal on its website within three months of the date of receipt of the proposed documents.\n4.   ACER may request changes to the approved proposal at any time. Within six months of the date of receipt of such a request, the ENTSO for Electricity shall submit a draft of the proposed changes to ACER. Within three months of the date of receipt of the draft, ACER shall amend or approve the changes and publish those changes on its website.\nCHAPTER V\nTRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATION\nArticle 28\nEuropean network of transmission system operators for electricity\n1.   Transmission system operators shall cooperate at Union level through the ENTSO for Electricity, in order to promote the completion and functioning of the internal market for electricity and cross-zonal trade and to ensure the optimal management, coordinated operation and sound technical evolution of the European electricity transmission network.\n2.   In performing its functions under Union law, the ENTSO for Electricity shall act with a view to establishing a well-functioning and integrated internal market for electricity and shall contribute to the efficient and sustainable achievement of the objectives set out in the policy framework for climate and energy covering the period from 2020 to 2030, in particular by contributing to the efficient integration of electricity generated from renewable energy sources and to increases in energy efficiency while maintaining system security. The ENTSO for Electricity shall be equipped with adequate human and financial resources to carry out its duties.\nArticle 29\nThe ENTSO for Electricity\n1.   The transmission system operators for electricity shall submit to the Commission and to ACER any draft amendments to the statutes, list of members or rules of procedure of the ENTSO for Electricity.\n2.   Within two months of receipt of the draft amendments to the statutes, list of members or rules of procedure, ACER, after consulting the organisations representing all stakeholders, in particular the system users, including customers, shall provide an opinion to the Commission on these draft amendments to the statutes, list of members or rules of procedure.\n3.   The Commission shall deliver an opinion on the draft amendments to the statutes, list of members or rules of procedures taking into account ACER's opinion as provided for in paragraph 2 and within three months of receipt of ACER's opinion.\n4.   Within three months of receipt of the Commission's favourable opinion, the transmission system operators shall adopt and publish the amended statutes or rules of procedure.\n5.   The documents referred to in paragraph 1 shall be submitted to the Commission and to ACER where there are changes thereto or upon the reasoned request of either of them. The Commission and ACER shall deliver an opinion in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.\nArticle 30\nTasks of the ENTSO for Electricity\n1.

Those guidelines may specify:\n(a)\ndetails of rules for the trading of electricity implementing Article 6 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 and Articles 5 to 10, 13 to 17, 35, 36 and 37 of this Regulation;\n(b)\ndetails of investment incentive rules for interconnector capacity including locational signals implementing Article 19.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 67(2).\n5.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts setting out guidelines on operational coordination between transmission system operators at Union level. Those guidelines shall be consistent with and build upon the network codes referred to in Article 59 and shall build upon the adopted specifications referred to in point (i) of Article 30(1). When adopting those guidelines, the Commission shall take into account differing regional and national operational requirements.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 67(2).\n6.   When adopting or amending guidelines, the Commission shall consult ACER, the ENTSO for Electricity, the EU DSO entity and, where relevant, other stakeholders.\nArticle 62\nRight of Member States to provide for more detailed measures\nThis Regulation shall be without prejudice to the rights of Member States to maintain or introduce measures that contain more detailed provisions than those set out in this Regulation, in the guidelines referred to in Article 61 or in the network codes referred to in Article 59, provided that those measures are compatible with Union law.\nCHAPTER VIII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 63\nNew interconnectors\n1.   New direct current interconnectors may, upon request, be exempted, for a limited period, from Article 19(2) and (3) of this Regulation and from Articles 6 and 43, Article 59(7) and Article 60(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe investment enhances competition in electricity supply;\n(b)\nthe level of risk attached to the investment is such that the investment would not take place unless an exemption is granted;\n(c)\nthe interconnector is owned by a natural or legal person which is separate, at least in terms of its legal form, from the system operators in whose systems that interconnector is to be built;\n(d)\ncharges are levied on users of that interconnector;\n(e)\nsince the partial market opening referred to in Article 19 of Directive 96/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (24), no part of the capital or operating costs of the interconnector has been recovered from any component of charges made for the use of transmission or distribution systems linked by the interconnector; and\n(f)\nan exemption would not be to the detriment of competition or the effective functioning of the internal market for electricity, or the efficient functioning of the regulated system to which the interconnector is linked.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall also apply, in exceptional cases, to alternating current interconnectors provided that the costs and risks of the investment in question are particularly high when compared with the costs and risks normally incurred when connecting two neighbouring national transmission systems by an alternating current interconnector.\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall also apply to significant increases of capacity in existing interconnectors.\n4.   The decision granting an exemption as referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be taken on a case-by-case basis by the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned. An exemption may cover all or part of the capacity of the new interconnector, or of the existing interconnector with significantly increased capacity.\nWithin two months of receipt of the request for exemption by the last of the regulatory authorities concerned, ACER may provide those regulatory authorities with an opinion. The regulatory authorities may base their decision on that opinion.\nIn deciding to grant an exemption, regulatory authorities shall take into consideration, on a case-by-case basis, the need to impose conditions regarding the duration of the exemption and non-discriminatory access to the interconnector. When deciding on those conditions, regulatory authorities shall, in particular, take account of additional capacity to be built or the modification of existing capacity, the time-frame of the project and national circumstances.\nBefore granting an exemption, the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned shall decide on the rules and mechanisms for management and allocation of capacity. Those congestion-management rules shall include the obligation to offer unused capacity on the market and users of the facility shall be entitled to trade their contracted capacities on the secondary market. In the assessment of the criteria referred to in points (a), (b) and (f) of paragraph 1, the results of the capacity-allocation procedure shall be taken into account.\nWhere all the regulatory authorities concerned have reached agreement on the exemption decision within six months of receipt of the request, they shall inform ACER of that decision.\nThe exemption decision, including any conditions referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph, shall be duly reasoned and published.\n5.   The decision referred to in paragraph 4 shall be taken by ACER:\n(a)\nwhere the regulatory authorities concerned have not been able to reach an agreement within six months from the date on which the last of those regulatory authorities received the exemption request; or\n(b)\nupon a joint request from the regulatory authorities concerned.\nBefore taking such a decision, ACER shall consult the regulatory authorities concerned and the applicants.\n6.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 4 and 5, Member States may provide for the regulatory authority or ACER, as the case may be, to submit, for a formal decision, to the relevant body in the Member State, its opinion on the request for an exemption. That opinion shall be published together with the decision.\n7.   A copy of every request for exemption shall be transmitted for information without delay by the regulatory authorities to the Commission and ACER on receipt. The decision shall be notified, without delay, by the regulatory authorities concerned or by ACER (the notifying bodies), to the Commission, together with all the relevant information with respect to the decision. That information may be submitted to the Commission in aggregate form, enabling the Commission to reach a well-founded decision. In particular, the information shall contain:\n(a)\nthe detailed reasons on the basis of which the exemption was granted or refused, including the financial information justifying the need for the exemption;\n(b)\nthe analysis undertaken of the effect on competition and the effective functioning of the internal market for electricity resulting from the grant of the exemption;\n(c)\nthe reasons for the time period and the share of the total capacity of the interconnector in question for which the exemption is granted; and\n(d)\nthe result of the consultation of the regulatory authorities concerned.\n8.   Within 50 working days of the day following that of receipt of the notification under paragraph 7, the Commission may take a decision requesting the notifying bodies to amend or withdraw the decision to grant an exemption. That period may be extended by an additional 50 working days where further information is requested by the Commission. The additional period shall begin on the day following receipt of the complete information. The initial period may also be extended by consent of both the Commission and the notifying bodies.\nWhere the requested information is not provided within the period set out in the Commission's request, the notification shall be deemed to be withdrawn unless, before the expiry of that period, either the period is extended by consent of both the Commission and the notifying bodies, or the notifying bodies, in a duly reasoned statement, inform the Commission that they consider the notification to be complete.\nThe notifying bodies shall comply with a Commission decision to amend or withdraw the exemption decision within one month of receipt and shall inform the Commission accordingly.\nThe Commission shall protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\nThe Commission's approval of an exemption decision shall expire two years after the date of its adoption in the event that construction of the interconnector has not started by that date, and five years after the date of its adoption if the interconnector has not become operational by that date, unless the Commission decides, on the basis of a reasoned request by the notifying bodies, that any delay is due to major obstacles beyond the control of the person to whom the exemption has been granted.\n9.   Where the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned decide to modify an exemption decision, they shall notify their decision to the Commission without delay, together with all the relevant information with respect to the decision. Paragraphs 1 to 8 shall apply to the decision to modify an exemption decision, taking into account the particularities of the existing exemption.\n10.   The Commission may, on request or on its own initiative, reopen proceedings relating to an exemption request where:\n(a)\ntaking due account of the legitimate expectations of the parties and of the economic balance achieved in the original exemption decision, there has been a material change in any of the facts on which the decision was based;\n(b)\nthe undertakings concerned act contrary to their commitments; or\n(c)\nthe decision was based on incomplete, incorrect or misleading information, which was provided by the parties.\n11.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 68 supplementing this Regulation by specifying guidelines for the application of the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article and setting out the procedure to be followed for the application of paragraphs 4 and 7 to 10 of this Article.\nArticle 64\nDerogations\n1.

electricity\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt revises the rules and principles of the internal EU electricity market to ensure it is well-functioning, competitive and undistorted.\nIt also supports the decarbonisation of the EU’s energy sector and the removal of barriers to cross-border trade in electricity.\nThe regulation is part of the Clean Energy for all Europeans package.\nKEY POINTS\nPrinciples\nThe regulation set outs a number of principles on which electricity markets should be operated including to:\nencourage free price formation and avoid actions which prevent price formation on the basis of supply and demand;\nfacilitate the development of more flexible generation, sustainable low-carbon generation and more flexible demand;\nprovide opportunity for consumers to act as market players in the energy market and in the energy transition;\npermit the decarbonisation of the electricity system, including making it possible to integrate electricity produced from renewable energy sources and providing incentives for energy efficiency;\nprovide incentives for investment in production, in particular long-term investment in a low-carbon and sustainable electricity system;\nfacilitate the progressive removal of obstacles to cross-border flows of electricity between bidding zones* or EU countries and to cross-border transactions on electricity and related service markets;\nallow the development of demonstration projects in sustainable, safe and low-carbon energy sources, technologies or systems to be carried out and used for the benefit of society.\nJust transition\nThe European Commission must help EU countries to address the social and economic impacts of the transition to clean energy including by supporting national strategies to reduce the extraction of coal and other solid fossil fuels.\nNetwork access and capacity management\nEU countries must take all appropriate measures to remedy congestion*.\nBidding zones should therefore be defined in such a way as to ensure market liquidity, efficient congestion management and overall market efficiency.\nThe European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity should report every 3 years on structural and other major physical congestion within and between bidding areas, including the location and frequency of such congestion.\nAny EU countries with an identified structural congestion would then decide, in cooperation with its transmission system operators*, either to establish national or multinational action plans in order to increase cross-border capacity available for trade or to revise or amend its bidding zone configuration.\nCapacity mechanism\nThe regulation set out the conditions under which EU countries could set up capacity mechanisms* and the principles for creating them.\nThese mechanisms aim to ensure that electricity supply is sufficient during peak periods by remunerating resources for their availability. They should be temporary and designed to address an identified problem of resource adequacy. They should be open to cross-border participation.\nA European generation adequacy assessment is introduced to verify if the introduction of capacity mechanisms is justified. EU countries introducing capacity mechanisms also need to notify implementation plans to the Commission to improve market functioning.\nAn emission limit of 550 g of fossil CO2 per kWh of electricity is put in place. New power plants that emit more than that and start commercial production after the regulation comes into force are no longer able to participate in capacity mechanisms.\nExisting power plants emitting more than 550 g of fossil CO2 per kWh and an average of 350 kg of CO2 per year per kW installed will not be able to participate in capacity mechanisms after 1 July 2025.\nCapacity contracts concluded before 31 December 2019 are not be affected by the new rules.\nRegional coordination centres\nThese centres support the regional coordination of transmission system operators.\nThey replace the existing Regional Security Coordinators, but have additional tasks related to system operation, market operation and risk preparedness.\nThe regulation also creates an EU distribution system operators (DSOs)* entity working in the common interest of the EU.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) 2019/943 repeals Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 (see summary on Cross-border exchanges in electricity) with effect from 31 December 2019.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 1 January 2020.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEnergy union for Europe (Council).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCongestion: a situation in which all requests from market participants to trade between network areas cannot be accommodated because they would significantly affect the physical flows on network elements which cannot accommodate those flows.\nBidding zone: the largest geographical area within which market participants are able to exchange energy without capacity allocation.\nTransmission system operator: a person who is responsible for operating and developing the electricity transmission system in an area, and its interconnections with other systems, and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity.\nCapacity mechanism: a temporary measure to ensure the achievement of the necessary level of resource adequacy by remunerating resources for their availability, excluding measures relating to ancillary services or congestion management.\nDistribution system operator: a person responsible for operating and developing the electricity distribution system in an area, and its interconnections with other systems, and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity (OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, pp. 54-124)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC (OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, pp. 1-21)\nRegulation (EU) 2019/942 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, pp. 22-53)\nDirective (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, pp. 125-199)\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, pp. 1-77)\nDirective (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, pp. 82-209)\nDirective (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, pp. 75-91)\nDirective 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, pp. 1-56)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2012/27/EU have been incorporated into the original text.
