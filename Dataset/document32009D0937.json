The draft programme shall be prepared in close cooperation with the Commission and the President of the European Council, and after appropriate consultations. It shall be presented in a single document no later than one month before the relevant period, with a view to its endorsement by the General Affairs Council (9).\n7.   The Presidency which is to hold office in the relevant period shall establish, for each Council configuration, and after appropriate consultations, draft agendas for Council meetings scheduled for the next six-month period, showing the legislative work and operational decisions envisaged. These draft agendas shall be established at the latest one week before the beginning of the relevant six-month period, on the basis of the Council's 18-month programme and after consulting the Commission. They shall be set out in a single document applying to all Council configurations. Where necessary, extra Council meetings may be provided for, in addition to those previously planned.\nIf during a six-month period any of the meetings planned during that period proves to be no longer warranted, the Presidency shall not convene it.\nArticle 3 (10)\nAgenda\n1.

The inclusion in the agenda of an item other than those appearing on the provisional agenda shall require unanimity in the Council. Items entered in this way may be put to the vote if all the procedural requirements provided for by the Treaties have been complied with.\n8.   However, an ‘A’ item shall be withdrawn from the agenda, unless the Council decides otherwise, if a position on an ‘A’ item might lead to further discussion thereof or if a member of the Council or the Commission so requests.\n9.

Conversely, files may be referred to a working party or to a committee again only when necessary, and in any event only with the remit to tackle precise, well-defined problems.\n2.\nThe Presidency shall take the steps necessary to advance work between meetings. It can, for example, with the agreement of the working party or committee, undertake in the most efficient way necessary consultations on specific problems with a view to reporting back to the working party or committee concerned on possible solutions. It can also conduct written consultations by requesting delegations to react in written form to a proposal before the next meeting of the working party or committee.\n3.\nWhenever appropriate, delegations shall set out the positions they are likely to take in a forthcoming meeting in written form before that meeting. When that includes proposals for amending text, delegations shall suggest specific wording. Wherever possible, written input shall be submitted jointly by delegations maintaining identical positions.\n4.\nCoreper shall avoid going over ground already covered in the preparation of its proceedings. That shall apply in particular to ‘I’ items, to information on the organisation and order of its business and to information on the agenda and organisation of forthcoming Council meetings. Wherever possible, delegations shall raise ‘Any other business’ items when Coreper's proceedings are being prepared rather than in Coreper itself.\n5.\nThe Presidency shall convey to delegations as soon as possible when Coreper's proceedings are being prepared all the information necessary to allow thorough preparation of Coreper's proceedings, including information on what the Presidency expects to achieve from the discussion on each agenda item. Conversely, the Presidency shall, as appropriate, encourage delegations to communicate to the other delegations, when Coreper's proceedings are being prepared, information on the positions they will be taking in Coreper. In this context the Presidency shall finalise Coreper's agenda. The Presidency may convene more frequently the groups that prepare Coreper's proceedings, when required by circumstances.\nConduct of meetings\n6.\nNo item shall be placed on the Council agenda simply for presentation by the Commission or by a Council member, except where a debate on new major initiatives is planned.\n7.\nThe Presidency shall refrain from placing on Coreper's agenda items for information only. Such information, e.g. on the outcome of meetings in another forum or with a third State or another institution, procedural or organisational questions, etc., should instead be transmitted to delegations when Coreper's proceedings are being prepared, whenever possible in written form, and should not be repeated in Coreper.\n8.\nAt the start of a meeting, the Presidency shall give any further information necessary regarding the handling of the meeting and in particular indicate the length of time it intends to be devoted to each item. It shall refrain from making lengthy introductions and avoid repeating information which is already known to delegations.\n9.\nAt the start of a discussion on a substantive point, the Presidency shall, depending on the type of discussion which is needed, indicate to delegations the maximum length of their interventions on that point. In most cases interventions should not exceed two minutes.\n10.\nFull table rounds shall be proscribed in principle; they may be used only in exceptional circumstances on specific questions, with a time limit on interventions set by the Presidency.\n11.\nThe Presidency shall give as much focus as possible to discussions, in particular by requesting delegations to react to compromise texts or specific proposals.\n12.\nDuring and at the end of meetings the Presidency shall refrain from making lengthy summaries of the discussions and shall confine itself to concluding briefly on the results (substance and/or procedure) achieved.\n13.\nDelegations shall avoid repeating points made by previous speakers. Their interventions shall be brief, substantive and to the point.\n14.\nLike-minded delegations shall be encouraged to hold consultations with a view to the presentation by a single spokesperson of a common position on a specific point.\n15.\nWhen discussing texts, delegations shall make concrete drafting proposals, in writing, rather than merely express their disagreement with a particular proposal.\n16.\nUnless indicated otherwise by the Presidency, delegations shall refrain from taking the floor when in agreement with a particular proposal; in this case silence shall be taken as agreement in principle.\nANNEX VI\nProvisions concerning the forms of acts\nA.

Each country is represented by one representative at ministerial level who may commit the government of that country. Together with the European Parliament, the Council exercises legislative functions. It adopts legislative acts, following the ordinary or special legislative procedure. The Council jointly with the European Parliament exercises budgetary functions. Finally, the Council performs policy-making and coordinating functions.\nThe Council configurations\nThe Council meets in 10 different configurations according to the subject matter dealt with.\nExcept for two configurations (General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council), the mandate of each configuration is not determined by the Treaties and follows from practice. The General Affairs Council ensures consistency in the work of the different Council configurations. It prepares the meetings of the European Council. It is responsible for overall coordination of policies, institutional and administrative questions, horizontal dossiers which affect several EU's policies;The Foreign Affairs Council is responsible for the whole of the EU’s external action, namely common foreign and security policy, common security and defence policy, common commercial policy, development cooperation and humanitarian aid.\nThe presidency of the Council of the European Union\nThe presidency of the Council, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration, is held by pre-established groups of 3 EU countries for a period of 18 months. Each member of the group chairs all Council configurations, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration, for 6 months. The group of 3 EU countries prepares a draft programme of Council activities for an 18-month period which is endorsed by the General Affairs Council after holding a public debate on it.\nThe Foreign Affairs Council has a permanent chairperson: the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. It is possible for the High Representative to be replaced by the EU country holding the Council Presidency. It is normally the case when the Council is convened to discuss common commercial policy issues.\nThe presidency is the driving force in carrying out the Council’s work.\nCoreper, committees and working parties\nThe Council is supported by the committee of the permanent representatives of the governments of the EU countries (Coreper) and by over 150 specialised working groups and committees which are the preparatory bodies of the Council.\nCoreper prepares the work of all the meetings of the Council and carries out the tasks assigned to it by the Council. Coreper 2 is composed of permanent representatives, while Coreper 1 is composed of deputy permanent representatives.\nCoreper: ensures consistency of the EU’s policies and actions and the observance of the principles of legality, subsidiarity, proportionality, as well as of the rules establishing the powers of EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and the rules on procedure, transparency and the quality of drafting;examines in advance all the items on the agenda for a Council meeting and ensures preparation of each file for the Council;for each file, it endeavours to reach an agreement at its level, which is then submitted to the Council;may set up committees or working groups to carry out preparatory tasks or studies;may adopt a number of procedural decisions, such as decision to hold a Council meeting in a place other than Brussels or Luxembourg, decision to use a written procedure, etc.\nFunctioning of the Council\nThe Council has its seat in Brussels, but holds its meetings in Luxembourg in April, June and October. Sessions of the Council are convened by the president, on its own initiative or at the request of one of its members or of the European Commission. The President sets the provisional agenda for each meeting of the Council.\nThe quorum must be checked before a vote is taken. This is reached if the majority of members of the Council are physically present. The Council votes on the initiative of its president. The president, furthermore, opens a voting procedure on the initiative of a member of the Council or of the Commission, provided that a majority of the Council’s members so decides.\nQualified majority voting (QMV)\nOn 1 November 2014, a new procedure for QMV, the ‘double majority’ rule, was introduced.\nWhen the Council votes on a proposal by the Commission or the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, a qualified majority is reached if 2 conditions are met: 55% of the members of the Council vote in favour — i.e. 15 out of 27 (since the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU);the proposal is supported by the members of the Council representing at least 65% of the EU population.\nWhen the Council does not act on a proposal by the Commission or the High Representative, a decision is adopted if: there are 72% of the members of the Council voting in favour; andthey represent at least 65% of the EU population.\nTransparency and publication of Council acts\nThe deliberations and votes on legislative acts are open to the public.\nThe Council’s first deliberation on important new non-legislative proposals containing legally binding rules in or for EU countries is open to the public.\nOn a decision taken by the Council or by Coreper, the Council holds public debates on important issues affecting the interests of the EU and its citizens. The Council also holds a number of policy debates in public.\nLegislative acts must be published in the Official Journal (OJ), as must regulations and directives which are addressed to all EU countries, decisions which do not specify to whom they are addressed, international agreements concluded by the EU. Article 17 of the Rules of Procedure lists other acts to be published in the OJ, including when Council or Coreper so decides.\nFROM WHEN DO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE APPLY?\n              \nThey have applied since 1 December 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nThe Council of the European Union.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2009/937/EU of 1 December 2009 adopting the Council’s Rules of Procedure (OJ L 325, 11.12.2009, pp. 35-61)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 2009/937/EU have been incorporated into the original text.
