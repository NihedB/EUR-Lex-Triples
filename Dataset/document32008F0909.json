{"celex_id": "32008F0909", "reference": "5.12.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 327/27\nCOUNCIL FRAMEWORK DECISION 2008/909/JHA\nof 27 November 2008\non the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 31(1)(a) and 34(2)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the initiative of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 endorsed the principle of mutual recognition, which should become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union.\n(2)\nOn 29 November 2000 the Council, in accordance with the Tampere conclusions, adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters (1), in which it called for an assessment of the need for modern mechanisms for the mutual recognition of final sentences involving deprivation of liberty (Measure 14) and for extended application of the principle of the transfer of sentenced persons to cover persons resident in a Member State (Measure 16).\n(3)\nThe Hague Programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union (2) requires Member States to complete the programme of measures, in particular in the field of enforcing final custodial sentences.\n(4)\nAll the Member States have ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons of 21 March 1983. Under that Convention, sentenced persons may be transferred to serve the remainder of their sentence only to their State of nationality and only with their consent and that of the States involved. The Additional Protocol to that Convention of 18 December 1997, which allows transfer without the person’s consent, subject to certain conditions, has not been ratified by all the Member States. Neither instrument imposes any basic duty to take charge of sentenced persons for enforcement of a sentence or order.\n(5)\nProcedural rights in criminal proceedings are a crucial element for ensuring mutual confidence among the Member States in judicial cooperation. Relations between the Member States, which are characterised by special mutual confidence in other Member States’ legal systems, enable recognition by the executing State of decisions taken by the issuing State’s authorities. Therefore, a further development of the cooperation provided for in the Council of Europe instruments concerning the enforcement of criminal judgments should be envisaged, in particular where citizens of the Union were the subject of a criminal judgment and were sentenced to a custodial sentence or a measure involving deprivation of liberty in another Member State. Notwithstanding the need to provide the sentenced person with adequate safeguards, his or her involvement in the proceedings should no longer be dominant by requiring in all cases his or her consent to the forwarding of a judgment to another Member State for the purpose of its recognition and enforcement of the sentence imposed.\n(6)\nThis Framework Decision should be implemented and applied in a manner which allows general principles of equality, fairness and reasonableness to be respected.\n(7)\nArticle 4(1)(c) contains a discretionary provision which enables the judgment and the certificate to be forwarded, for example, to the Member State of nationality of the sentenced person, in cases other than those provided for in paragraphs 1(a) and (b) or to the Member State in which the sentenced person lives and has been legally residing continuously for at least five years and will retain a permanent right of residence there.\n(8)\nIn cases referred to in Article 4(1)(c) the forwarding of the judgment and the certificate to the executing State is subject to consultations between the competent authorities of the issuing and the executing States, and the consent of the competent authority of the executing State. The competent authorities should take into account such elements as, for example, duration of the residence or other links to the executing State. In cases where the sentenced person could be transferred to a Member State and to a third country under national law or international instruments, the competent authorities of the issuing and executing States should, in consultations, consider whether enforcement in the executing State would enhance the aim of social rehabilitation better than enforcement in the third country.\n(9)\nEnforcement of the sentence in the executing State should enhance the possibility of social rehabilitation of the sentenced person. In the context of satisfying itself that the enforcement of the sentence by the executing State will serve the purpose of facilitating the social rehabilitation of the sentenced person, the competent authority of the issuing State should take into account such elements as, for example, the person’s attachment to the executing State, whether he or she considers it the place of family, linguistic, cultural, social or economic and other links to the executing State.\n(10)\nThe opinion of the sentenced person referred to in Article 6(3) may be useful mainly in applying Article 4(4). The words ‘in particular’ are intended to cover also cases where the opinion of the sentenced person would include information which might be of relevance in relation to the grounds for non-recognition and non-enforcement. Provisions of Articles 4(4) and 6(3) do not constitute a ground for refusal on social rehabilitation.\n(11)\nPoland needs more time than the other Member States to face the practical and material consequences of transfer of Polish citizens convicted in other Member States, especially in the light of an increased mobility of Polish citizens within the Union. For that reason, a temporary derogation of limited scope for a maximum period of five years should be foreseen.\n(12)\nThis Framework Decision should also, mutatis mutandis, apply to the enforcement of sentences in the cases under Articles 4(6) and 5(3) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (3). This means, inter alia, that, without prejudice to that Framework Decision, the executing State could verify the existence of grounds for non-recognition and non-enforcement as provided in Article 9 of this Framework Decision, including the checking of double criminality to the extent that the executing State makes a declaration under Article 7(4) of this Framework Decision, as a condition for recognising and enforcing the judgment with a view to considering whether to surrender the person or to enforce the sentence in cases pursuant to Article 4(6) of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA.\n(13)\nThis Framework Decision respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and reflected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Chapter VI thereof. Nothing in this Framework Decision should be interpreted as prohibiting refusal to execute a decision when there are objective reasons to believe that the sentence was imposed for the purpose of punishing a person on the grounds of his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person’s position may be prejudiced on any one of those grounds.\n(14)\nThis Framework Decision should not prevent any Member State from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media.\n(15)\nThis Framework Decision should be applied in accordance with the right of citizens of the Union to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States conferred by Article 18 of the Treaty establishing European Community.\n(16)\nThis Framework Decision should be applied in accordance with applicable Community legislation, including in particular Council Directive 2003/86/EC (4), Council Directive 2003/109/EC (5) and Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(17)\nWhere in this Framework Decision reference is made to the State in which the sentenced person ‘lives’, this indicates the place to which that person is attached based on habitual residence and on elements such as family, social or professional ties.\n(18)\nWhen applying Article 5(1), it should be possible to transmit a judgment or a certified copy thereof and a certificate to the competent authority in the executing State by any means which leaves a written record, for example e-mail and fax, under conditions allowing the executing State to establish authenticity.\n(19)\nIn cases referred to in Article 9(1)(k), the executing State should consider the possibility of adapting the sentence in accordance with this Framework Decision before it refuses to recognise and enforce the sentence involving a measure other than a custodial sentence.\n(20)\nThe ground for refusal provided for in Article 9(1)(k) may be applied also in cases where the person has not been found guilty of a criminal offence although the competent authority applied the measure involving the deprivation of liberty other than a custodial sentence as a consequence of a criminal offence.\n(21)\nThe ground for refusal relating to territoriality should be applied only in exceptional cases and with a view to cooperating to the greatest extent possible under the provisions of this Framework Decision, while taking into account its purpose. Any decision to apply this ground for refusal, should be based on a case-by-case analysis and consultations between the competent authorities of the issuing and executing States.\n(22)\nThe time limit referred to in Article 12(2) should be implemented by the Member States in such a way that as a general rule, the final decision, including an appeal procedure is completed within a period of 90 days.\n(23)\nArticle 18(1) states that, subject to the exceptions listed in paragraph 2, the specialty rule applies only where the person has been transferred to the executing State. It should therefore not be applicable where the person has not been transferred to the executing State, for example where the person has fled to the executing State,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS FRAMEWORK DECISION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Framework Decision:\n(a)\n‘judgment’ shall mean a final decision or order of a court of the issuing State imposing a sentence on a natural person;\n(b)\n‘sentence’ shall mean any custodial sentence or any measure involving deprivation of liberty imposed for a limited or unlimited period of time on account of a criminal offence on the basis of criminal proceedings;\n(c)\n‘issuing State’ shall mean the Member State in which a judgment is delivered;\n(d)\n‘executing State’ shall mean the Member State to which a judgment is forwarded for the purpose of its recognition and enforcement.\nArticle 2\nDetermination of the competent authorities\n1.   Each Member State shall inform the General Secretariat of the Council which authority or authorities, under its national law, are competent in accordance with this Framework Decision, when that Member State is the issuing State or the executing State.\n2.   The General Secretariat of the Council shall make the information received available to all Member States and the Commission.\nArticle 3\nPurpose and scope\n1.   The purpose of this Framework Decision is to establish the rules under which a Member State, with a view to facilitating the social rehabilitation of the sentenced person, is to recognise a judgment and enforce the sentence.\n2.   This Framework Decision shall apply where the sentenced person is in the issuing State or in the executing State.\n3.   This Framework Decision shall apply only to the recognition of judgments and the enforcement of sentences within the meaning of this Framework Decision. The fact that, in addition to the sentence, a fine and/or a confiscation order has been imposed, which has not yet been paid, recovered or enforced, shall not prevent a judgment from being forwarded. The recognition and enforcement of such fines and confiscation orders in another Member State shall be based on the instruments applicable between the Member States, in particular Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA of 24 February 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties (7) and Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA of 6 October 2006 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders (8).\n4.   This Framework Decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.\nCHAPTER II\nRECOGNITION OF JUDGMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT OF SENTENCES\nArticle 4\nCriteria for forwarding a judgment and a certificate to another Member State\n1.   Provided that the sentenced person is in the issuing State or in the executing State, and provided that this person has given his or her consent where required under Article 6, a judgment, together with the certificate for which the standard form is given in Annex I, may be forwarded to one of the following Member States:\n(a)\nthe Member State of nationality of the sentenced person in which he or she lives; or\n(b)\nthe Member State of nationality, to which, while not being the Member State where he or she lives, the sentenced person will be deported, once he or she is released from the enforcement of the sentence on the basis of an expulsion or deportation order included in the judgment or in a judicial or administrative decision or any other measure taken consequential to the judgment; or\n(c)\nany Member State other than a Member State referred to in (a) or (b), the competent authority of which consents to the forwarding of the judgment and the certificate to that Member State.\n2.   The forwarding of the judgment and the certificate may take place where the competent authority of the issuing State, where appropriate after consultations between the competent authorities of the issuing and the executing States, is satisfied that the enforcement of the sentence by the executing State would serve the purpose of facilitating the social rehabilitation of the sentenced person.\n3.   Before forwarding the judgment and the certificate, the competent authority of the issuing State may consult, by any appropriate means, the competent authority of the executing State. Consultation shall be obligatory in the cases referred to in paragraph 1(c). In such cases the competent authority of the executing State shall promptly inform the issuing State of its decision whether or not to consent to the forwarding of the judgment.\n4.   During such consultation, the competent authority of the executing State may present the competent authority of the issuing State with a reasoned opinion, that enforcement of the sentence in the executing State would not serve the purpose of facilitating the social rehabilitation and successful reintegration of the sentenced person into society.\nWhere there has been no consultation, such an opinion may be presented without delay after the transmission of the judgment and the certificate. The competent authority of the issuing State shall consider such opinion and decide whether to withdraw the certificate or not.\n5.   The executing State may, on its own initiative, request the issuing State to forward the judgment together with the certificate. The sentenced person may also request the competent authorities of the issuing State or of the executing State to initiate a procedure for forwarding the judgment and the certificate under this Framework Decision. Requests made under this paragraph shall not create an obligation of the issuing State to forward the judgment together with the certificate.\n6.   In implementing this Framework Decision, Member States shall adopt measures, in particular taking into account the purpose of facilitating social rehabilitation of the sentenced person, constituting the basis on which their competent authorities have to take their decisions whether or not to consent to the forwarding of the judgment and the certificate in cases pursuant to paragraph 1(c).\n7.   Each Member State may, either on adoption of this Framework Decision or later, notify the General Secretariat of the Council that, in its relations with other Member States that have given the same notification, its prior consent under paragraph 1(c) is not required for the forwarding of the judgment and the certificate:\n(a)\nif the sentenced person lives in and has been legally residing continuously for at least five years in the executing State and will retain a permanent right of residence in that State, and/or\n(b)\nif the sentenced person is a national of the executing State in cases other than those provided for in paragraph 1(a) and (b).\nIn cases referred to in point (a), permanent right of residence shall mean that the person concerned:\n—\nhas a right of permanent residence in the respective Member State in accordance with the national law implementing Community legislation adopted on the basis of Article 18, 40, 44 and 52 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, or\n—\npossesses a valid residence permit, as a permanent or long-term resident, for the respective Member State, in accordance with the national law implementing Community legislation adopted on the basis of Article 63 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as regards Member States to which such Community legislation is applicable, or in accordance with national law, as regards Member States to which it is not.\nArticle 5\nForwarding of the judgment and the certificate\n1.   The judgment or a certified copy of it, together with the certificate, shall be forwarded, by the competent authority of the issuing State directly to the competent authority of the executing State by any means which leaves a written record under conditions allowing the executing State to establish its authenticity. The original of the judgment, or a certified copy of it, and the original of the certificate, shall be sent to the executing State if it so requires. All official communications shall also be made directly between the said competent authorities.\n2.   The certificate, shall be signed, and its content certified as accurate, by the competent authority of the issuing State.\n3.   The issuing State shall forward the judgment together with the certificate to only one executing State at any one time.\n4.   If the competent authority of the executing State is not known to the competent authority of the issuing State, the latter shall make all necessary inquiries, including via the Contact points of the European Judicial Network set up by Council Joint Action 98/428/JHA (9), in order to obtain the information from the executing State.\n5.   When an authority of the executing State which receives a judgment together with a certificate has no competence to recognise it and take the necessary measures for its enforcement, it shall, ex officio, forward the judgment together with the certificate to the competent authority of the executing State and inform the competent authority of the issuing State accordingly.\nArticle 6\nOpinion and notification of the sentenced person\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, a judgment together with a certificate may be forwarded to the executing State for the purpose of its recognition and enforcement of the sentence only with the consent of the sentenced person in accordance with the law of the issuing State.\n2.   The consent of the sentenced person shall not be required where the judgment together with the certificate is forwarded:\n(a)\nto the Member State of nationality in which the sentenced person lives;\n(b)\nto the Member State to which the sentenced person will be deported once he or she is released from the enforcement of the sentence on the basis of an expulsion or deportation order included in the judgment or in a judicial or administrative decision or any other measure consequential to the judgment;\n(c)\nto the Member State to which the sentenced person has fled or otherwise returned in view of the criminal proceedings pending against him or her in the issuing State or following the conviction in that issuing State.\n3.   In all cases where the sentenced person is still in the issuing State, he or she shall be given an opportunity to state his or her opinion orally or in writing. Where the issuing State considers it necessary in view of the sentenced person’s age or his or her physical or mental condition, that opportunity shall be given to his or her legal representative.\nThe opinion of the sentenced person shall be taken into account when deciding the issue of forwarding the judgement together with the certificate. Where the person has availed him or her self of the opportunity provided in this paragraph, the opinion of the sentenced person shall be forwarded to the executing State, in particular with a view to Article 4(4). If the sentenced person stated his or her opinion orally, the issuing State shall ensure that the written record of such statement is available to executing State.\n4.   The competent authority of the issuing State shall inform the sentenced person, in a language which he or she understands, that it has decided to forward the judgment together with the certificate by using the standard form of the notification set out in Annex II. When the sentenced person is in the executing State at the time of that decision, that form shall be transmitted to the executing State which shall inform the sentenced person accordingly.\n5.   Paragraph 2(a) shall not apply to Poland as an issuing State and as an executing State in cases where the judgement was issued before the lapse of five years from 5 December 2011. Poland may at any time notify the General Secretariat of the Council that it will no longer avail itself of this derogation.\nArticle 7\nDouble criminality\n1.   The following offences, if they are punishable in the issuing State by a custodial sentence or a measure involving deprivation of liberty for a maximum period of at least three years, and as they are defined by the law of the issuing State, shall, under the terms of this Framework Decision and without verification of the double criminality of the act, give rise to recognition of the judgment and enforcement of the sentence imposed:\n—\nparticipation in a criminal organisation,\n—\nterrorism,\n—\ntrafficking in human beings,\n—\nsexual exploitation of children and child pornography,\n—\nillicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,\n—\nillicit trafficking in weapons, munitions and explosives,\n—\ncorruption,\n—\nfraud, including that affecting the financial interests of the European Communities within the meaning of the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the protection of the European Communities’ financial interests (10),\n—\nlaundering of the proceeds of crime,\n—\ncounterfeiting currency, including of the euro,\n—\ncomputer-related crime,\n—\nenvironmental crime, including illicit trafficking in endangered animal species and in endangered plant species and varieties,\n—\nfacilitation of unauthorised entry and residence,\n—\nmurder, grievous bodily injury,\n—\nillicit trade in human organs and tissue,\n—\nkidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking,\n—\nracism and xenophobia,\n—\norganised or armed robbery,\n—\nillicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiques and works of art,\n—\nswindling,\n—\nracketeering and extortion,\n—\ncounterfeiting and piracy of products,\n—\nforgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein,\n—\nforgery of means of payment,\n—\nillicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters,\n—\nillicit trafficking in nuclear or radioactive materials,\n—\ntrafficking in stolen vehicles,\n—\nrape,\n—\narson,\n—\ncrimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court,\n—\nunlawful seizure of aircraft/ships,\n—\nsabotage.\n2.   The Council may decide to add other categories of offences to the list provided for in paragraph 1 at any time, acting unanimously after consultation of the European Parliament under the conditions laid down in Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union. The Council shall examine, in the light of the report submitted to it pursuant to Article 29(5) of this Framework Decision, whether the list should be extended or amended.\n3.   For offences other than those covered by paragraph 1, the executing State may make the recognition of the judgment and enforcement of the sentence subject to the condition that it relates to acts which also constitute an offence under the law of the executing State, whatever its constituent elements or however it is described.\n4.   Each Member State may, on adoption of this Framework Decision or later, by a declaration notified to the General Secretariat of the Council declare that it will not apply paragraph 1. Any such declaration may be withdrawn at any time. Such declarations or withdrawals of declarations shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 8\nRecognition of the judgment and enforcement of the sentence\n1.   The competent authority of the executing State shall recognise a judgment which has been forwarded in accordance with Article 4 and following the procedure under Article 5, and shall forthwith take all the necessary measures for the enforcement of the sentence, unless it decides to invoke one of the grounds for non-recognition and non-enforcement provided for in Article 9.\n2.   Where the sentence is incompatible with the law of the executing State in terms of its duration, the competent authority of the executing State may decide to adapt the sentence only where that sentence exceeds the maximum penalty provided for similar offences under its national law. The adapted sentence shall not be less than the maximum penalty provided for similar offences under the law of the executing State.\n3.   Where the sentence is incompatible with the law of the executing State in terms of its nature, the competent authority of the executing State may adapt it to the punishment or measure provided for under its own law for similar offences. Such a punishment or measure shall correspond as closely as possible to the sentence imposed in the issuing State and therefore the sentence shall not be converted into a pecuniary punishment.\n4.   The adapted sentence shall not aggravate the sentence passed in the issuing State in terms of its nature or duration.\nArticle 9\nGrounds for non-recognition and non-enforcement\n1.   The competent authority of the executing State may refuse to recognise the judgment and enforce the sentence, if:\n(a)\nthe certificate referred to in Article 4 is incomplete or manifestly does not correspond to the judgment and has not been completed or corrected within a reasonable deadline set by the competent authority of the executing State;\n(b)\nthe criteria set forth in Article 4(1) are not met;\n(c)\nenforcement of the sentence would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem;\n(d)\nin a case referred to in Article 7(3) and, where the executing State has made a declaration under Article 7(4), in a case referred to in Article 7(1), the judgment relates to acts which would not constitute an offence under the law of the executing State. However, in relation to taxes or duties, customs and exchange, execution of a judgment may not be refused on the ground that the law of the executing State does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain the same type of rules as regards taxes, duties and customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State;\n(e)\nthe enforcement of the sentence is statute-barred according to the law of the executing State;\n(f)\nthere is immunity under the law of the executing State, which makes it impossible to enforce the sentence;\n(g)\nthe sentence has been imposed on a person who, under the law of the executing State, owing to his or her age, could not have been held criminally liable for the acts in respect of which the judgment was issued;\n(h)\nat the time the judgment was received by the competent authority of the executing State, less than six months of the sentence remain to be served;\n(i)\nthe judgment was rendered in absentia, unless the certificate states that the person was summoned personally or informed via a representative competent according to the national law of the issuing State of the time and place of the proceedings which resulted in the judgment being rendered in absentia, or that the person has indicated to a competent authority that he or she does not contest the case;\n(j)\nthe executing State, before a decision is taken in accordance with Article 12(1), makes a request, in accordance with Article 18(3), and the issuing State does not consent, in accordance with Article 18(2)(g), to the person concerned being prosecuted, sentenced or otherwise deprived of his or her liberty in the executing State for an offence committed prior to the transfer other than that for which the person was transferred;\n(k)\nthe sentence imposed includes a measure of psychiatric or health care or another measure involving deprivation of liberty, which, notwithstanding Article 8(3), cannot be executed by the executing State in accordance with its legal or health care system;\n(l)\nthe judgment relates to criminal offences which under the law of the executing State are regarded as having been committed wholly or for a major or essential part within its territory, or in a place equivalent to its territory.\n2.   Any decision under paragraph 1(l) in relation to offences committed partly within the territory of the executing State, or in a place equivalent to its territory, shall be taken by the competent authority of the executing State in exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the specific circumstances of the case, and in particular to whether a major or essential part of the conduct in question has taken place in the issuing State.\n3.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b), (c), (i), (k) and (l), before deciding not to recognise the judgment and enforce the sentence, the competent authority of the executing State shall consult the competent authority of the issuing State, by any appropriate means, and shall, where appropriate, ask it to supply any necessary additional information without delay.\nArticle 10\nPartial recognition and enforcement\n1.   If the competent authority of the executing State could consider recognition of the judgment and enforcement of the sentence in part, it may, before deciding to refuse recognition of the judgment and enforcement of the sentence in whole, consult the competent authority of the issuing State with a view to finding an agreement, as provided for in paragraph 2.\n2.   The competent authorities of the issuing and the executing States may agree, on a case-by-case basis, to the partial recognition and enforcement of a sentence in accordance with the conditions set out by them, provided such recognition and enforcement does not result in the aggravation of the duration of the sentence. In the absence of such agreement, the certificate shall be withdrawn.\nArticle 11\nPostponement of recognition of the judgment\nThe recognition of the judgment may be postponed in the executing State where the certificate referred to in Article 4 is incomplete or manifestly does not correspond to the judgment, until such reasonable deadline set by the executing State for the certificate to be completed or corrected.\nArticle 12\nDecision on the enforcement of the sentence and time limits\n1.   The competent authority in the executing State shall decide as quickly as possible whether to recognise the judgment and enforce the sentence and shall inform the issuing State thereof, including of any decision to adapt the sentence in accordance with Article 8(2) and (3).\n2.   Unless a ground for postponement exists under Article 11 or Article 23(3), the final decision on the recognition of the judgment and the enforcement of the sentence shall be taken within a period of 90 days of receipt of the judgment and the certificate.\n3.   When in exceptional cases it is not practicable for the competent authority of the executing State to comply with the period provided for in paragraph 2, it shall without delay inform the competent authority of the issuing State by any means, giving the reasons for the delay and the estimated time needed for the final decision to be taken.\nArticle 13\nWithdrawal of the certificate\nAs long as the enforcement of the sentence in the executing State has not begun, the issuing State may withdraw the certificate from that State, giving reasons for doing so. Upon withdrawal of the certificate, the executing State shall no longer enforce the sentence.\nArticle 14\nProvisional arrest\nWhere the sentenced person is in the executing State, the executing State may, at the request of the issuing State, before the arrival of the judgment and the certificate, or before the decision to recognise the judgment and enforce the sentence, arrest the sentenced person, or take any other measure to ensure that the sentenced person remains in its territory, pending a decision to recognise the judgment and enforce the sentence. The duration of the sentence shall not be aggravated as a result of any period spent in custody by reason of this provision.\nArticle 15\nTransfer of sentenced persons\n1.   If the sentenced person is in the issuing State, he or she shall be transferred to the executing State at a time agreed between the competent authorities of the issuing and the executing States, and no later than 30 days after the final decision of the executing State on the recognition of the judgment and enforcement of the sentence has been taken.\n2.   If the transfer of the sentenced person within the period laid down in paragraph 1 is prevented by unforeseen circumstances, the competent authorities of the issuing and executing States shall immediately contact each other. Transfer shall take place as soon as these circumstances cease to exist. The competent authority of the issuing State shall immediately inform the competent authority of the executing State and agree on a new transfer date. In that event, transfer shall take place within 10 days of the new date thus agreed.\nArticle 16\nTransit\n1.   Each Member State shall, in accordance with its law, permit the transit through its territory of a sentenced person who is being transferred to the executing State, provided that a copy of the certificate referred to in Article 4 has been forwarded to it by the issuing State together with the transit request. The transit request and the certificate may be transmitted by any means capable of producing a written record. Upon request of the Member State to permit transit, the issuing State shall provide a translation of the certificate into one of the languages, to be indicated in the request, which the Member State requested to permit transit accepts.\n2.   When receiving a request to permit transit, the Member State requested to permit transit shall inform the issuing State if it cannot guarantee that the sentenced person will not be prosecuted, or, except as provided in paragraph 1, detained or otherwise subjected to any restriction of his or her liberty in its territory for any offence committed or sentence imposed before his or her departure from the territory of the issuing State. In such a case, the issuing State may withdraw its request.\n3.   The Member State requested to permit transit shall notify its decision, which shall be taken on a priority basis and not later than one week after having received the request, by the same procedure. Such a decision may be postponed until the translation has been transmitted to the Member State requested to permit transit, where such translation is required under paragraph 1.\n4.   The Member State requested to permit transit may hold the sentenced person in custody only for such time as transit through its territory requires.\n5.   A transit request shall not be required in the case of transport by air without a scheduled stopover. However, if an unscheduled landing occurs, the issuing State shall provide the information provided for in paragraph 1 within 72 hours.\nArticle 17\nLaw governing enforcement\n1.   The enforcement of a sentence shall be governed by the law of the executing State. The authorities of the executing State alone shall, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, be competent to decide on the procedures for enforcement and to determine all the measures relating thereto, including the grounds for early or conditional release.\n2.   The competent authority of the executing State shall deduct the full period of deprivation of liberty already served in connection with the sentence in respect of which the judgment was issued from the total duration of the deprivation of liberty to be served.\n3.   The competent authority of the executing State shall, upon request, inform the competent authority of the issuing State of the applicable provisions on possible early or conditional release. The issuing State may agree to the application of such provisions or it may withdraw the certificate.\n4.

The aim is to help convicted persons to better reintegrate in society.\nIt allows an EU country to enforce a prison sentence imposed by another EU country against a person who resides in its territory.\nIt sets up a system for the transfer of convicted prisoners back to the EU country of which they are nationals (or normally live) or to another EU country with which they have close ties so that they serve their prison sentence there.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe procedure is based on the following principles:\nA judgment with a certificate is transmitted directly by the competent authority of the issuing country to the country enforcing it.\nThe transfer is subject to the consent of the convicted person, but can be made without this consent in specified circumstances. In all cases, the convicted person should have the chance to give his/her opinion if s/he is still in the country of its issue.\nThe country of enforcement must, without delay, take measures to enforce the sentence. If a sentence is adapted, it must correspond as closely as possible to, and never be harsher than, the original sentence.\nThe execution of a sentence is governed by the law of the country of enforcement, as are the grounds for early or conditional release (when the person must respect conditions, such as not going to a certain district).\nThe decision sets out a list of serious offences that are punishable in the issuing country by at least 3 years in prison, for which judgments are recognised and enforced and for which there is no need to check for dual criminality (i.e. when a crime exists under the law of both issuing and enforcing countries).\nThe country of enforcement must, in most cases, decide within 90 days of receiving the judgment and the certificate whether to recognise the judgment and whether to impose the sentence. The decision includes a limited list of grounds on the basis of which a country may refuse to recognise a judgment and enforce a sentence.\nThe European Commission’s 2014 report on the implementation of the Framework Decisions 2008/909/JHA, 2008/947/JHA and 2009/829/JHA notes that, despite the efforts made to date by some EU countries, the implementation of these three acts is unsatisfactory. It calls on EU countries that have not already implemented the decisions to do so promptly.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE FRAMEWORK DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt entered into force on 5 December 2008. EU countries had to incorporate it in national by 5 December 2011.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nEach year, several thousand EU citizens are pursued for alleged criminal offences or are convicted in an EU country other than their own. Mutual recognition of judicial decisions is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the EU.\nACT\n            \nCouncil Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union (OJ L 327, 5.12.2008, pp. 27–46)\nRELATED ACTS\n              \n            \nCouncil Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions (OJ L 337, 16.12.2008, pp. 102–122)\nCouncil Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA of 23 October 2009 on the application, between Member States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention (OJ L 294, 11.11.2009, pp. 20–40)\nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation by the Member States of the Framework Decisions 2008/909/JHA, 2008/947/JHA and 2009/829/JHA on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions on custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty, on probation decisions and alternative sanctions and on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention (COM(2014) 57 final of 5.2.2014)\nCommission Staff Working Document — Tables ‘State of play’ and ‘Declarations’ accompanying the document: report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation by the Member States of the Framework Decisions 2008/909/JHA, 2008/947/JHA and 2009/829/JHA on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions on custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty, on probation decisions and alternative sanctions and on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention (SWD(2014) 34 final of 5.2.2014)\nCommission Decision 2014/858/EU of 1 December 2014 on the notification by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of its wish to participate in acts of the Union in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and which are not part of the Schengen acquis (OJ L 345, 1.12.2014, pp. 6–9)\nlast update 17.10.2015", "tags": ["criminal procedure", "rights of the defence", "criminal law", "mutual recognition principle", "European arrest warrant", "enforcement of ruling"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
