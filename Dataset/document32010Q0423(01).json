As such, the ECA warns of risks, provides assurance, indicates shortcomings and good practice, and offers guidance to policymakers and legislators on how to improve the management of EU policies and programmes. The ECA acts as the independent guardian of EU citizens’ financial interests.\nArticle 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out the role of the Court.\nThe ECA draws up its own Rules of Procedure which must then be approved by the Council. They govern the internal workings of the ECA. The rules cover aspects such as:\nthe organisation of the Court (appointments, terms of office, the Court’s duties, election of the President);\noperational procedures (the Court and Chambers meetings; decision-making by the Court, Chambers and Committees; audits and preparation of reports, opinions, observations and statements of assurance).\nKEY POINTS\nComposition and structure\nThe Court is a collegial body, that is, its Members are jointly responsible for decisions and actions taken. It comprises 27 Members — one from each EU Member State. Members are appointed for 6 years (renewable). To be appointed, Members must belong or have belonged to an external audit body in their own Member State or be especially qualified for this office. ECA Members are subject to a code of conduct governing their independence, impartiality, integrity, commitment, collegiality, confidentiality, responsibility and obligations after leaving office.\nMembers elect one of their peers as President for 3 years (renewable). His/her duties include: calling and chairing Court meetings;ensuring the Court’s decisions are implemented;ensuring that the Court’s departments, including protocol and visits, communication, legal matters and internal audit, operate properly and that its various activities are well managed;appointing an agent to represent the Court in litigation;representing the Court in its external relations and in its relations with the other EU institutions.\nThe Court has a Secretary-General, who is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Court’s Secretariat, and for administration, finance and support, human resources, information technology and translation.\nThe Court also comprises Chambers and Committees: Chambers adopt opinions, special reports and specific annual reports. They also prepare the annual reports on the EU budget, which are then adopted by the Court;Committees (e.g. the Administrative Committee and the Audit Committee) deal with administrative matters and decisions on issues related to communication and strategy.\nTasks of the Court\nThe ECA is the independent external auditor of the European Union. Its reports and opinions are an essential element of the EU accountability chain. They are used to hold to account those responsible for implementing EU policies and programmes: the Commission, other EU institutions and bodies, and administrations in Member States.\nThe ECA warns of risks, provides assurance, indicates shortcomings and good practice, and offers guidance to policymakers and legislators on how to improve the management of EU policies and programmes so that they can achieve value for money.\nAudits\nThese are:\nbased on records and, if necessary, performed on the spot in the other EU institutions;\nperformed on the premises of any organisation which manages revenue or expenditure on behalf of the EU;\nperformed in the Member States and in countries across the world, including on the premises of any natural or legal person in receipt of payments from the EU budget.\nIn its role as the EU’s external auditor, the Court cooperates with the national authorities and the EU institutions. It may also request any information required to successfully complete its task from the EU institutions and bodies, organisations in receipt of payments from the European budget or from national audit institutions.\nStrategy and work programmes\nTo remain at the forefront of developments in public-sector auditing, the ECA plans its strategic development and audit priorities in advance. Its core objectives are set out in multi-year strategies.\nEach year, the Court adopts a work programme listing its priorities in terms of audit tasks. The programme is published, and presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament by the Court’s President.\nAnnual discharge procedure\nThe Court of Auditors has no judicial powers and therefore no power to impose sanctions. After the close of each financial year, it draws up an annual report to be published in the Official Journal. This report concerns the management of the EU budget and the European Development Funds, by the competent institutions. It is a fundamental part of the European Parliament’s decision-making process regarding the granting of the budget discharge to the Commission.\nThe Court of Auditors also provides the Council and the Parliament with a statement of assurance concerning the reliability of the accounts and attesting that the budget has been used well, in accordance with the rules and regulations. In addition, the Court may also, at any time, submit observations, particularly in the form of special reports, on specific questions, or review reports, and deliver opinions where the Court is legally required to do so, at the request of one of the other EU institutions or on its own initiative.\nThe Court decides in formal session, by the majority of its Members, on the adoption of the annual report. Its meetings are not public, unless it decides otherwise. It may also decide, on a case-by-case basis, to adopt decisions by written procedure.\nThe ECA reports on irregularities in the use of EU funds and refers any cases of suspected fraud detected during its audits to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) or to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO).\nFROM WHEN DO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE APPLY?\n              \nThey have applied since 1 June 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe Court of Auditors, based in Luxembourg, was set up in 1977 and has been a fully-fledged EU institution since 1992.\nFor more information, see:\nECA legal framework (European Court of Auditors)\nDecision No 21-2021 laying down the rules for implementing the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Auditors (European Court of Auditors)\nEU budget (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nConsolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union — Part six — Institutional and financial provisions — Title I — Institutional provisions — Chapter 1 — The institutions — Section 7 — The Court of Auditors — Article 287 (ex Article 248 TEC) (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, pp. 170-171)\nRules of Procedure of the Court of Auditors of the European Union (OJ L 103, 23.4.2010, pp. 1-6)\nSee consolidated version.\nRELATED DOCUMENT\n            \nCode of Conduct for the Members and former Members of the Court of Auditors (OJ L 128, 2.5.2022, pp. 102–113)\nlast update 02.05.2022", "tags": ["European Court of Auditors", "rules of procedure"], "subjects": ["Provisions governing the Institutions"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
