In their decision, they specified that such a facility should be financed from resources allocated to each of them under the existing cooperation agreements with the European Union and be supplemented by an equivalent amount of unallocated European Development Fund resources.(3) In order to ensure rapid and efficient response to situations of violent conflict, the creation of a Peace Facility is appropriate.(4) To allow for the creation of a Peace Facility for Africa, in accordance with Article 11 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, supplementary resources should be allocated to intra-ACP cooperation. Since the envelope for regional cooperation and integration as defined in paragraph 3(b) of Annex I to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement is exhausted, the necessary resources will therefore be transferred from allocations notified to individual ACP-countries under the long-term development envelope of the ninth EDF as defined in paragraph 3(a) of Annex I to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, as well as from unallocated resources of that envelope,HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:Article 1Peace support1. A contribution of 1,5 % shall be taken from allocations that were notified to African ACP States in accordance with Article 1(b) of Annex IV to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. Such contribution will be taken from the uncommitted balance of the allocation referred to in Article 3(2)(b) of Annex IV to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, the so-called B-allocation. If the uncommitted balance of the B-allocation is insufficient, the remainder will be taken from the uncommitted balance of the allocation referred to in Article 3(2)(a) of Annex IV, the so-called A-allocation. A total amount of EUR 126,4 million shall thus be transferred from the respective country allocations to the intra-ACP allocation under the envelope for regional cooperation and integration and used for the creation of a Peace Facility for Africa. Individual contributions are specified in the last column of the table in the Annex to this Decision.2. An amount of EUR 123,6 million shall be transferred from unallocated resources of the 9th EDF long-term development envelope to the intra-ACP allocation under the envelope for regional cooperation and integration, and used for the creation of a Peace Facility for Africa.Article 2Financing requestIn accordance with Article 13(2)(b) of Annex IV to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, the ACP Council of Ministers requests the Commission to finance a Peace Facility for Africa for a total amount of EUR 250 million.Article 3ImplementationThe ACP States, the Member States and the Community shall be bound, each to the extent to which it is concerned, to take the measures necessary to implement this Decision.Article 4Entry into forceThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.Done at Brussels, 11 December 2003.For the ACP-EC Council of MinistersThe PresidentFranco Frattini(1) OJ L 50, 21.2.2002, p. 62.(2) OJ L 59, 4.3.2003, p. 24.ANNEXContributions from country allocations>TABLE>", "summary": "Peace Facility for Africa\nPeace Facility for Africa\nSUMMARY OF:\nDecision No 3/2003 of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers on the use of EDF resources for the creation of a Peace Facility for Africa\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?\n              \nIt establishes a financing scheme for the African Peace Facility (APF), which constitutes the main source of EU funding for the efforts of the African Union (AU) and Africa’s regional economic communities (RECs) in the area of peace and security.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe legal basis for the APF is in the Cotonou Agreement, and it is funded through the European Development Fund (EDF).\nThe APF is based on the principle of African ownership. The direct beneficiaries of APF support are the African Union and African regional economic communities and regional mechanisms.\nSince 2004, the APF has received more than € 2.2 billion in EU funding.\nPeace support\nSupport for peacekeeping and peace-building is a key mission of the APF.\nThe APF has successfully supported peacekeeping operations in the Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Mali, Somalia, the Lake Chad basin, and Comoros.\nCapacity-building\nSince 2007, capacity-building has been a major component of the APF. It aims to strengthen the capacities and efficiency of the AU and the RECs/RMs in planning and conducting peace support operations.\nThe long-term goal is to enable the African institutions to ensure peace and security on their own.\nEarly response\nThe early response mechanism allows for urgent needs to be addressed by providing funding for the first stages of actions for the prevention, management and resolution of crises.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 11 December 2003.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘African Peace Facility’ on the European Commission's website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDecision No 3/2003 of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers of 11 December 2003 on the use of resources from the long-term development envelope of the ninth EDF for the creation of a Peace Facility for Africa (OJ L 345, 31.12.2003, pp. 108–111)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 617/2007 of 14 May 2007 on the implementation of the 10th European Development Fund under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (OJ L 152, 13.6.2007, pp. 1–13)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 617/2007 have been incorporated into the original document.
