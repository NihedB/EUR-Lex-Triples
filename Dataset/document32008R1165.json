Further amendments and simplifications now being necessary, these acts should, for reasons of clarity, be replaced by one single act.\n(2)\nIn order to ensure that the common agricultural policy is properly administered, particularly where the beef, veal, pigmeat, sheepmeat, goatmeat and poultrymeat markets are concerned, the Commission requires regular data on trends in livestock and meat production.\n(3)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organisation of Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings (5) provides for a programme of Community surveys to produce statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings up to 2007.\n(4)\nIn accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) (6), all Member States' statistics transmitted to the Commission which are broken down by territorial units are to use the NUTS classification. Consequently, in order to establish comparable regional statistics, the territorial units should be defined in accordance with the NUTS classification.\n(5)\nIn order to limit the burden on Member States, regional data requirements should not exceed the requirements established by previous legislation (unless new regional levels have come into existence in the meantime) and regional data should be optional when regional livestock numbers are below certain thresholds.\n(6)\nIn order to facilitate implementation of this Regulation, close cooperation is necessary between Member States and the Commission and this may be achieved in particular with the assistance of the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC (7).\n(7)\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition from the regime applicable under Directives 93/23/EEC, 93/24/EEC and 93/25/EEC, this Regulation should allow for the granting of a derogation for a period of up to one year and, in the case of sheep and goats, up to two years, to Member States where application of this Regulation to their national statistical systems would require major adaptations and would be likely to cause significant practical problems.\n(8)\nThe measures for the production of statistics provided for in this Regulation are necessary for carrying out the activities of the Community. Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on livestock and meat in Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(9)\nIn accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics (8), which constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation, it is necessary for the collection of statistics to conform to the principles of impartiality, meaning in particular objectivity and scientific independence, as well as transparency, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.\n(10)\nThe measures necessary for implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9).\n(11)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend Annexes I, II, IV and V. Since such measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(12)\nDirectives 93/23/EEC, 93/24/EEC and 93/25/EEC should therefore be repealed.\n(13)\nThe Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics has been consulted,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to establish a common legal framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on livestock and meat production in Member States, in particular:\n(a)\nstatistics on bovine, pig, sheep and goat livestock;\n(b)\nslaughtering statistics on bovine animals, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry; and\n(c)\nproduction forecasts of beef, veal, pigmeat, sheepmeat and goatmeat.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘agricultural holding’ means an agricultural holding as defined in Article 2(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods (10);\n2.\n‘sample survey’ means a sample survey as defined in Article 2(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008;\n3.\nthe term ‘bovine animal’ means domestic animals of the species Bos taurus and Bubalus bubalis, including hybrids like Beefalo;\n4.\nthe term ‘pig’ means domestic animals of the species Sus scrofa domestica;\n5.\nthe term ‘sheep’ means domestic animals of the species Ovis aries;\n6.\nthe term ‘goat’ means domestic animals of the subspecies Capra aegagrus hircus;\n7.\nthe term ‘poultry’ means domestic birds of the species Gallus gallus (chickens), Meleagris spp. (turkeys), Anas spp. and Cairina moschata (ducks) and Anser anser dom.

These statistics are used to manage and evaluate the EU’s common agricultural policy.\nIt repeals Directives 93/23/EEC, 93/24/EEC and 93/25/EEC.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe regulation covers statistics on:\nbovine*, pig, sheep and goat livestock;\nbovine animals, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry slaughtering.\nIt also covers the compilation of production forecasts for beef, veal, pigmeat, sheepmeat and goat meat.\nLivestock statistics\nCoverage and categories\nEU countries must produce statistics on the number of bovine animals, pigs, sheep and goats held on agricultural holdings on their territory. Those conducting sample surveys must cover sufficient agricultural holdings to account for at least 95% of the entire population, as determined by the last survey on the structure of agricultural holdings. The categories for which livestock statistics are produced are set out in AnnexII of the regulation.\nFrequency and reference period\nStatistics on sheep and goats are produced yearly, whereas for bovine animals and pigs they are produced twice yearly. The exception is in countries where the population of a certain animal type is below a given threshold. where statistics are not produced for sheep and goats and where these are only produced yearly for bovines and pigs.\nPrecision\nEU countries conducting sample surveys must ensure that extrapolated national survey results meet the precision requirements in Annex III of the regulation.\nWhere countries use an administrative source, they must inform the European Commission (Eurostat) of their methodology and of the quality of data.\nWhen using sources other than surveys, the information obtained must be of at least equal quality to the information obtained from statistical surveys.\nTransmission deadlines\nThe regulation sets deadlines by which EU countries must transmit provisional and definitive livestock statistics to the Commission.\nRegional statistics\nNovember/December statistics must be broken down by NUTS 1 and NUTS 2 territorial units as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003, and only by NUTS 1 territorial units for Germany and the United Kingdom (1). If these territorial units together constitute 5% or less of the national population of the relevant animals, then these statistics are optional for territorial units having fewer than:\n75,000 bovine animals,\n150,000 pigs,\n100,000 sheep, and\n25,000 goats.\nSlaughtering statistics\nCoverage and categories\nEach EU country must produce statistics relating to the number and carcass weight of bovine animals, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry slaughtered in slaughterhouses on its territory and whose meat is deemed fit for human consumption. It must also supply estimates of the extent of slaughtering not carried out in slaughterhouses, so that the statistics include all bovine animals, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry slaughtered on its territory. The categories for which statistics should be produced are listed in AnnexIV of the regulation.\nFrequency and transmission\nStatistics on slaughtering in slaughterhouses are to be produced monthly and be transmitted to Eurostat within 60 days.\nMeat production forecasts\nCoverage\nEU countries must use the livestock and slaughtering statistics and other available information to produce forecasts of their supply of bovine animals, pigs, sheep and goats. This supply must be expressed as the gross indigenous production, which corresponds to the number of bovine animals, pigs, sheep and goats slaughtered plus the balance of trade within the EU and of external trade in these live animals.
