It ensures that radio spectrum is available across the Union under harmonised conditions, eliminates barriers to the take-up of UWB technology and aims at creating an effective single market for UWB systems with significant economies of scale and benefits to the consumer.\n(2)\nAlthough ultra-wideband signals are typically of extremely low power, the possibility of harmful interference with existing radiocommunication services exists and needs to be managed. Therefore, this Decision on the harmonisation of radio spectrum for UWB equipment should avoid harmful interference (including where this might arise from access to the radio spectrum by radio astronomy, earth exploration satellite and space research systems) and balance the incumbent services' interests against the overall policy objective of providing favourable conditions for the introduction of innovative technologies for the benefit of society.\n(3)\nOn 16 March 2017, the Commission issued a permanent mandate, pursuant to Decision No 676/2002/EC, to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (‘CEPT’) to identify the technical conditions for the harmonised introduction of radio applications based on UWB technology in the Union in order to provide updated technical conditions for such applications.\n(4)\nIn response to that permanent mandate, CEPT adopted a report (3) where it proposed four measures. Firstly, the technical conditions should describe material sensing devices in a more neutral way in order to allow for innovative solutions. Secondly, it should be possible to use the conditions for generic UWB usage also for material sensing applications. Thirdly, there should be a – 65 dBm/MHz limit for all material sensing devices including building material analysis (BMA) in the 8,5-10,6 GHz band. Fourthly, the possibility of a trigger-before-transmit mitigation for vehicular access control systems based on UWB technology should be introduced in the 3,8-4,2 GHz and 6-8,5 GHz frequency bands.\n(5)\nThis Decision should support the overall harmonisation of the UWB regulatory framework in order to improve consistency of limits and mitigation techniques between the different UWB regulations and allow for innovative solutions in the field of UWB technology.\n(6)\nThis Decision provides for regulatory limits and identifies mitigation techniques to ensure an efficient usage of spectrum while ensuring coexistence with other spectrum users. Technological evolution may provide other solutions that ensure at least an equivalent level of spectrum protection. For this reason, the use of alternative mitigation techniques, such as solutions found in future possible harmonised standards produced by the European Standardisation Organisations, should be allowed provided they ensure at least an equivalent level of performance and spectrum protection and verifiably respect the established technical requirements of this regulatory framework.\n(7)\nDecision 2007/131/EC has been amended several times. In the interest of legal clarity Decision 2007/131/EC should be repealed.\n(8)\nThe measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe purpose of this Decision is to harmonise the technical conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum by equipment using ultra-wideband technology in the Union.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘equipment using ultra-wideband technology’ means equipment incorporating, as an integral part or as an accessory, technology for short-range radiocommunication, involving the intentional generation and transmission of radio-frequency energy that spreads over a frequency range wider than 50 MHz, which may overlap several frequency bands allocated to radiocommunication services;\n(b)\n‘non-interference and non-protected basis’ means that no harmful interference may be caused to any radiocommunication service and that no claim may be made for protection of these devices against interference originating from radiocommunication services;\n(c)\n‘indoors’ means inside buildings or places in which the shielding will typically provide the necessary attenuation to protect radiocommunication services against harmful interference;\n(d)\n‘motor vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(11) of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4);\n(e)\n‘railway vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(1)(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/643 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5);\n(f)\n‘e.i.r.p.’ means equivalent isotropically radiated power, which is the product of the power supplied to the antenna and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic antenna (absolute or isotropic gain);\n(g)\n‘maximum mean power spectral density’ means the average power per unit bandwidth (centred on that frequency) radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p. of the radio device under test at a particular frequency;\n(h)\n‘peak power’ means the power contained within a 50 MHz bandwidth at the frequency at which the highest mean radiated power occurs, radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p.;\n(i)\n‘total power spectral density’ means the average of the mean power spectral density values measured over a sphere around the measurement scenario with a resolution of at least 15 degrees;\n(j)\n‘onboard aircraft’ means the use of radio links for communications purposes inside an aircraft;\n(k)\n‘LT1’ means systems intended for general location tracking of people and objects that can be put into service on an unlicensed basis.\nArticle 3\nWithin six months after this Decision takes effect, Member States shall designate and make available the radio spectrum, on a non-interference and non-protected basis, for equipment using ultra-wideband technology provided that such equipment meets the conditions set out in the Annex and it is used indoors or, if it is used outdoors, it is not attached to a fixed installation, a fixed infrastructure or a fixed outdoor antenna. Equipment using ultra-wideband technology which meets the conditions set out in the Annex shall also be allowed in motor and railway vehicles.\nArticle 4\nMember States shall monitor the use of the bands identified in the Annex by equipment using ultra-wideband technology, in particular to ensure that all the conditions laid down in Article 3 of this Decision continue to be relevant, and report their findings to the Commission.\nArticle 5\nDecision 2007/131/EC is repealed.\nArticle 6\nThis Decision is addressed to Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 14 May 2019.\nFor the Commission\nMariya GABRIEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)  OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1.\n(2)  Commission Decision 2007/131/EC of 21 February 2007 on allowing the use of the radio spectrum for equipment using ultra-wideband technology in a harmonised manner in the Community (OJ L 55, 23.2.2007, p. 33).\n(3)  CEPT Report 69 – Report from CEPT to the European Commission in response to the Mandate ‘Ultra-Wideband technology in view of a potential update of Commission Decision 2007/131/EC’, approved on 26 October 2018 by the Electronic Communications Committee.\n(4)  Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1).\n(5)  Regulation (EU) 2018/643 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 April 2018 on rail transport statistics (OJ L 112, 2.5.2018, p. 1).\nANNEX\n1.

MATERIAL SENSING DEVICES USING UWB TECHNOLOGY\n5.1.   Introduction\nUWB material sensing devices are split into two classes:\n—\nContact based UWB material sensing devices, for which the UWB transmitter is only switched on when in direct contact with the material under investigation;\n—\nNon-contact based UWB material sensing devices, for which the UWB transmitter is only switched on when it is near the investigated material and the UWB transmitter is directed towards the material under investigation (for example manually by using a proximity sensor or by mechanical design).\nMaterial sensing devices based on UWB technology shall comply either with the generic UWB regulation based on technical conditions specified in section 1 of this Annex or with the specific limits for material sensing devices as defined in sections 5.2 and 5.3.\nThe generic UWB regulation excludes fixed outdoor installations. Emissions radiated by a material sensing device must not exceed the limits of the regulation for generic UWB usage specified in section 1. Material sensing devices must fulfil the requirements of mitigation techniques specified for the generic use of UWB in section 1.\nThe specific limits for material sensing devices including the mitigation techniques are listed in the following tables. Emissions radiating from material sensing devices permitted under this Decision must be kept to a minimum and in any case not exceed the emission limits within the following tables. Compliance with the specific limits must be ensured by the device placed on a representative structure of the investigated material. The specific limits listed in the following tables are applicable in all environments for material sensing devices, except those to which note 5 of these tables, which excludes fixed outdoor installation in certain applicable frequency ranges, applies.\n5.2.

EU countries are responsible for radio spectrum management, and the amendments reflect how European and international harmonisation and technical agreements have evolved.\nThe ‘DECT’ directive designates the 1 880-1 900 MHz frequency band for digital cordless communications by 1 January 1992 and obliges EU countries to bring into force the necessary national laws, regulations and administrative rules.\nKEY POINTS\nThe decisions\nThe implementing decisions cover radio equipment devices that are operated through general authorisation or on an unlicensed or shared basis by end-users. This includes radio local access network devices (wi-fi) devices which have shown massive growth in demand for radio spectrum, as acknowledged in the 2018 European Electronic Communications Code.\nMany of these acts are harmonisation decisions. Others deal with frequency bands for different purposes, such as a huge variety of short range devices, Internet of Things (IoT) equipment, ultra-wide band equipment, alarms, door openers, medical implants, intelligent transport systems, radio frequency identification devices (RFID), radio determination, ground probing, and new types of machine-to-machine devices, as well as equipment for programme making and special events (PMSE) such as wireless video links or microphones and digital cordless telephones.\nA further general authorisation band relates to vehicle safety, in particular to the operation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).\nThe various implementing decisions cover the following radio spectrum, in addition to limits on signal strength and harmful interference where applicable:\nthe 5 GHz frequency band (5 150-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz) for wireless access systems, including radio local area networks (WAS/RLANs — wi-fi broadband);\nthe 3 400-3 800 MHz frequency band for terrestrial systems for ‘fixed, nomadic and mobile electronic communications networks’;\nthe 5 875-5 935 MHz frequency band for safety-related applications of Intelligent Transport Systems;\nthe radio spectrum for use by short-range devices;\nthe 24 GHz range radio spectrum band for the time-limited use by automotive short-range radar equipment;\nradio spectrum use by wireless audio programme-making and special events equipment;\nthe 2 010-2 025 MHz frequency band for portable or mobile wireless video links and cordless cameras used for programme making and special events;\nthe 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz frequency bands for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services in relation to the Internet of Things;\nradio spectrum for use by short-range devices within the 874-876 and 915-921 MHz frequency bands;\nradio spectrum for equipment using ultra-wideband technology, such as vehicle and aircraft location tracking.\nDirective 91/287/EEC\nThe directive obliges EU countries to designate the 1 880-1 900 MHz frequency band for digital cordless communications by 1 January 1992.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DIRECTIVE AND DECISIONS APPLY?\nLegislation\nApplication date\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2020/1426\n8 October 2020\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2019/785\n16 May 2019\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/1538\n12 October 2018\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/637\n23 April 2018\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2017/2077\n13 November 2017\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2017/1483\n10 August 2017\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2016/339\n9 March 2016\nImplementing Decision 2014/641/EU\n2 September 2014\nImplementing Decision 2013/752/EU\n12 December 2013\nImplementing Decision 2011/829/EU\n9 December 2011\nImplementing Decision 2011/485/EU\n1 August 2011\nDecision 2010/368/EU\n1 July 2010\nDecision 2009/381/EC\n14 May 2009\nDecision 2007/90/EC\n12 February 2007\nDecision 2008/411/EC\n21 May 2008\nDecision 2005/513/EC\n11 July 2005\nDirective 91/287/EEC\n5 June 1991\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nWhat is Radio Spectrum Policy?
