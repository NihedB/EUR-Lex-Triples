{"celex_id": "32009R1071", "reference": "14.11.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 300/51\nREGULATION (EC) No 1071/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 October 2009\nestablishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and repealing Council Directive 96/26/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor (2),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe completion of an internal market in road transport with fair conditions of competition requires the uniform application of common rules on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator or road passenger transport operator (the occupation of road transport operator). Such common rules will contribute to the achievement of a higher level of professional qualification for road transport operators, the rationalisation of the market and an improved quality of service, in the interests of road transport operators, their customers and the economy as a whole, together with improvements in road safety. They will also facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment by road transport operators.\n(2)\nCouncil Directive 96/26/EC of 29 April 1996 on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator and mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications intended to facilitate for these operators the right to freedom of establishment in national and international transport operations (4) lays down minimum conditions governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator and the mutual recognition of the documents required in this connection. However, experience, an impact assessment and various studies show that that Directive is being applied inconsistently by Member States. Such disparities have several adverse consequences, in particular a distortion of competition and a lack of market transparency and of uniform monitoring, as well as the risk that undertakings employing staff with a low level of professional qualification may be negligent in respect of, or less compliant with, the rules on road safety and social welfare, which may harm the image of the sector.\n(3)\nThese consequences are all the more detrimental as they are liable to disturb the smooth functioning of the internal market in road transport, since the market in the transport of international goods and certain cabotage operations is accessible to undertakings throughout the Community. The only condition imposed on such undertakings is that they have a Community licence, which can be obtained provided they satisfy the conditions governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on common rules for access to the international road haulage market (5) and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services (6).\n(4)\nIt is therefore appropriate to modernise the existing rules on admission to the occupation of road transport operator in order to ensure that those rules are applied more uniformly and effectively. Since compliance with those rules constitutes the main condition governing access to the Community market, and the applicable Community instruments in this field are Regulations, a Regulation would appear to be the most appropriate instrument to govern admission to the occupation of road transport operator.\n(5)\nMember States should be allowed to adapt the conditions with which to comply in order to pursue the occupation of road transport operator in the outermost regions referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty because of the special characteristics of, and constraints in, those regions. However, the undertakings established in those regions which comply with the conditions to pursue the occupation of road transport operator only as a result of such adaptation should not be able to obtain a Community licence. The adaptation of the conditions to pursue the occupation of road transport operator should not hinder undertakings which would have been admitted to the occupation of road transport operator and which comply with the general conditions laid down in this Regulation from carrying out transport operations in the outermost regions.\n(6)\nIn the interests of fair competition, the common rules governing the exercise of the occupation of road transport operator should apply as widely as possible to all undertakings. However, it is unnecessary to include within the scope of this Regulation undertakings which only perform transport operations with a very small impact on the transport market.\n(7)\nIt should be the responsibility of the Member State of establishment to verify that an undertaking satisfies at all times the conditions laid down in this Regulation so that the competent authorities of that Member State are able, if necessary, to decide to suspend or withdraw the authorisations which allow that undertaking to operate on the market. Proper compliance with, and reliable monitoring of, the conditions governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator presuppose that undertakings have an effective and stable establishment.\n(8)\nNatural persons with the requisite good repute and professional competence should be clearly identified and designated to the competent authorities. Such persons (transport managers), should be resident in a Member State and effectively and continuously manage the transport activities of road transport undertakings. It is therefore appropriate to specify the conditions under which a person is considered to effectively and continuously manage the transport activities of an undertaking.\n(9)\nThe good repute of transport managers is conditional on their not having been convicted of a serious criminal offence or not having incurred a penalty, for a serious infringement, in particular, of Community rules relating to road transport. A conviction or penalty incurred by a transport manager or a road transport undertaking in one or more Member States for the most serious infringements of Community rules should result in the loss of good repute provided that the competent authority has ascertained that a duly completed and documented investigation procedure granting essential procedural rights took place before its final decision and that appropriate rights of appeal were respected.\n(10)\nIt is necessary for road transport undertakings to have a minimum financial standing to ensure their proper launching and administration. A bank guarantee or a professional liability insurance may constitute a simple and cost-efficient method of demonstrating the financial standing of undertakings.\n(11)\nA high level of professional qualification should increase the socioeconomic efficiency of the road transport sector. It is therefore appropriate that applicants for the post of transport manager should possess high-quality professional knowledge. In order to ensure greater uniformity of examinations and to promote a high quality of training, it is appropriate to provide that Member States may authorise examination and training centres according to criteria to be defined by them. Transport managers should possess the requisite knowledge for managing both national and international transport operations. The list of subjects of which knowledge is required in order to obtain a certificate of professional competence and the procedures for the organisation of examinations are likely to evolve with technical progress, and provision should be made for updating them. It should be possible for Member States to exempt from the examinations persons who can provide proof of continuous experience in managing transport activities.\n(12)\nFair competition and road transport that is fully compliant with the rules call for a uniform level of monitoring by Member States. The national authorities responsible for monitoring undertakings and the validity of their authorisations have a crucial role to play in this respect, and it is appropriate to ensure that they take suitable measures if necessary, in particular in the most serious cases by suspending or withdrawing authorisations or declaring as unsuitable transport managers who are repeatedly negligent or who act in bad faith. This must be preceded by due consideration of the measure with respect to the proportionality principle. An undertaking should, however, be warned in advance and should have a reasonable period of time within which to rectify the situation before incurring such penalties.\n(13)\nBetter organised administrative cooperation between Member States would improve the effectiveness of the monitoring of undertakings operating in several Member States and would reduce administrative costs in the future. Electronic registers of undertakings interconnected throughout the Community, which comply with the Community rules on the protection of personal data, would facilitate such cooperation and reduce the costs involved in checks for both undertakings and administrations. National registers already exist in several Member States. Infrastructure has also been set up with a view to promoting interconnection between Member States. A more systematic use of electronic registers could therefore make a significant contribution to reducing the administrative costs of checks and to improving their effectiveness.\n(14)\nSome data contained in national electronic registers concerning infringements and penalties are personal. Member States should therefore take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (7), in particular with regard to the monitoring of the processing of personal data by public authorities, the right of data subjects to be provided with information, their right of access and their right to object. For the purposes of this Regulation, it would appear to be necessary to retain such data for at least 2 years to ensure that disqualified undertakings do not establish themselves in other Member States.\n(15)\nIn order to improve transparency and to allow the client of a transport undertaking to verify whether that undertaking is in possession of the appropriate authorisation, certain data contained in the national electronic register should be made publicly accessible, in so far as the relevant provisions on data protection are complied with.\n(16)\nIt is essential to gradually interconnect national electronic registers so as to enable information to be exchanged rapidly and efficiently between Member States and to guarantee that road transport operators are not tempted to commit, or to take the risk of committing, serious infringements in Member States other than their Member State of establishment. Interconnection of this kind entails the joint definition of the precise format of the data to be exchanged and the technical procedures for the exchange of that data.\n(17)\nIn order to ensure the efficient exchange of information between Member States, national contact points should be designated and certain common procedures relating as a minimum to time limits and the nature of the information to be forwarded, should be specified.\n(18)\nIn order to facilitate freedom of establishment, the production of appropriate documents issued by a competent authority in the Member State where the transport manager used to reside should be accepted as sufficient proof of good repute for admission to the occupation of road transport operator in the Member State of establishment, provided that the persons concerned have not been declared unfit to pursue that occupation in other Member States.\n(19)\nWith regard to professional competence, in order to facilitate freedom of establishment, a single model certificate issued in accordance with this Regulation should be regarded as sufficient proof by the Member State of establishment.\n(20)\nCloser monitoring of the application of this Regulation at Community level is required. This presupposes the forwarding to the Commission of regular reports, drawn up on the basis of national registers, on the good repute, financial standing and professional competence of undertakings in the road transport sector.\n(21)\nMember States should provide for penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation. Such penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(22)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the modernisation of the rules governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator in order to ensure that those rules are applied more uniformly and effectively in the Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale and effects of the action be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(23)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8).\n(24)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to draw up a list of categories, types and degrees of seriousness of infringements leading to the loss of good repute of road transport operators, to adapt to technical progress Annexes I, II and III to this Regulation concerning the knowledge to be taken into consideration for the recognition of professional competence by the Member States and the model certificate of professional competence, and to draw up a list of infringements which in addition to those set out in Annex IV to this Regulation may lead to the loss of good repute. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(25)\nDirective 96/26/EC should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation governs admission to, and the pursuit of, the occupation of road transport operator.\n2.   This Regulation shall apply to all undertakings established in the Community which are engaged in the occupation of road transport operator. It shall also apply to undertakings which intend to engage in the occupation of road transport operator. References to undertakings engaged in the occupation of road transport operator shall, as appropriate, be considered to include a reference to undertakings intending to engage in such occupation.\n3.   As regards the regions referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, the Member States concerned may adapt the conditions to be complied with in order to pursue the occupation of road transport operator, in so far as operations are fully carried out in those regions by undertakings established there.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, this Regulation shall, unless otherwise provided for in national law, not apply to:\n(a)\nundertakings engaged in the occupation of road haulage operator solely by means of motor vehicles or combinations of vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3,5 tonnes. Member States may, however, lower this limit for all or some categories of road transport operations;\n(b)\nundertakings engaged in road passenger transport services exclusively for non-commercial purposes or which have a main occupation other than that of road passenger transport operator;\n(c)\nundertakings engaged in the occupation of road transport operator solely by means of motor vehicles with a maximum authorised speed not exceeding 40 km/h.\n5.   Member States may exempt from the application of all or some of the provisions of this Regulation only those road transport operators engaged exclusively in national transport operations having only a minor impact on the transport market because of:\n(a)\nthe nature of the goods carried; or\n(b)\nthe short distances involved.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n1.\n‘the occupation of road haulage operator’ means the activity of any undertaking transporting goods for hire or reward by means either of motor vehicles or combinations of vehicles;\n2.\n‘the occupation of road passenger transport operator’ means the activity of any undertaking operating, by means of motor vehicles so constructed and equipped as to be suitable for carrying more than nine persons, including the driver, and intended for that purpose, passenger transport services for the public or for specific categories of users in return for payment by the person transported or by the transport organiser;\n3.\n‘the occupation of road transport operator’ means the occupation of road passenger transport operator or the occupation of road haulage operator;\n4.\n‘undertaking’ means any natural person, any legal person, whether profit-making or not, any association or group of persons without legal personality, whether profit-making or not, or any official body, whether having its own legal personality or being dependent upon an authority having such personality, engaged in the transport of passengers, or any natural or legal person engaged in the transport of freight with a commercial purpose;\n5.\n‘transport manager’ means a natural person employed by an undertaking or, if that undertaking is a natural person, that person or, where provided for, another natural person designated by that undertaking by means of a contract, who effectively and continuously manages the transport activities of that undertaking;\n6.\n‘authorisation to pursue the occupation of road transport operator’ means an administrative decision which authorises an undertaking which satisfies the conditions laid down in this Regulation to pursue the occupation of road transport operator;\n7.\n‘competent authority’ means a national, regional or local authority in a Member State which, for the purpose of authorising the pursuit of the occupation of road transport operator, verifies whether an undertaking satisfies the conditions laid down in this Regulation, and which is empowered to grant, suspend or withdraw an authorisation to pursue the occupation of road transport operator;\n8.\n‘Member State of establishment’ means the Member State in which an undertaking is established, regardless of whether its transport manager originates from another country.\nArticle 3\nRequirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator\n1.   Undertakings engaged in the occupation of road transport operator shall:\n(a)\nhave an effective and stable establishment in a Member State;\n(b)\nbe of good repute;\n(c)\nhave appropriate financial standing; and\n(d)\nhave the requisite professional competence.\n2.   Member States may decide to impose additional requirements, which shall be proportionate and non-discriminatory, to be satisfied by undertakings in order to engage in the occupation of road transport operator.\nArticle 4\nTransport manager\n1.   An undertaking which engages in the occupation of road transport operator shall designate at least one natural person, the transport manager, who satisfies the requirements set out in Article 3(1)(b) and (d) and who:\n(a)\neffectively and continuously manages the transport activities of the undertaking;\n(b)\nhas a genuine link to the undertaking, such as being an employee, director, owner or shareholder or administering it, or, if the undertaking is a natural person, is that person; and\n(c)\nis resident in the Community.\n2.   If an undertaking does not satisfy the requirement of professional competence laid down in Article 3(1)(d), the competent authority may authorise it to engage in the occupation of road transport operator without a transport manager designated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, provided that:\n(a)\nthe undertaking designates a natural person residing in the Community who satisfies the requirements laid down in Article 3(1)(b) and (d), and who is entitled under contract to carry out duties as transport manager on behalf of the undertaking;\n(b)\nthe contract linking the undertaking with the person referred to in point (a) specifies the tasks to be performed on an effective and continuous basis by that person, and indicates his or her responsibilities as transport manager. The tasks to be specified shall comprise, in particular, those relating to vehicle maintenance management, verification of transport contracts and documents, basic accounting, the assignment of loads or services to drivers and vehicles, and the verification of safety procedures;\n(c)\nin his or her capacity as transport manager, the person referred to in point (a) may manage the transport activities of up to four different undertakings carried out with a combined maximum total fleet of 50 vehicles. Member States may decide to lower the number of undertakings and/or the size of the total fleet of vehicles which that person may manage; and\n(d)\nthe person referred to in point (a) performs the specified tasks solely in the interests of the undertaking and his or her responsibilities are exercised independently of any undertakings for which the undertaking carries out transport operations.\n3.   Member States may decide that a transport manager designated in accordance with paragraph 1 may not in addition be designated in accordance with paragraph 2, or may only be so designated in respect of a limited number of undertakings or a fleet of vehicles that is smaller than that referred to in paragraph 2(c).\n4.   The undertaking shall notify the competent authority of the transport manager or managers designated.\nCHAPTER II\nCONDITIONS TO BE MET TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE 3\nArticle 5\nConditions relating to the requirement of establishment\nIn order to satisfy the requirement laid down in Article 3(1)(a), an undertaking shall, in the Member State concerned:\n(a)\nhave an establishment situated in that Member State with premises in which it keeps its core business documents, in particular its accounting documents, personnel management documents, documents containing data relating to driving time and rest and any other document to which the competent authority must have access in order to verify compliance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation. Member States may require that establishments on their territory also have other documents available at their premises at any time;\n(b)\nonce an authorisation is granted, have at its disposal one or more vehicles which are registered or otherwise put into circulation in conformity with the legislation of that Member State, whether those vehicles are wholly owned or, for example, held under a hire-purchase agreement or a hire or leasing contract;\n(c)\nconduct effectively and continuously with the necessary administrative equipment its operations concerning the vehicles mentioned in point (b) and with the appropriate technical equipment and facilities at an operating centre situated in that Member State.\nArticle 6\nConditions relating to the requirement of good repute\n1.   Subject to paragraph 2 of this Article, Member States shall determine the conditions to be met by undertakings and transport managers in order to satisfy the requirement of good repute laid down in Article 3(1)(b).\nIn determining whether an undertaking has satisfied that requirement, Member States shall consider the conduct of the undertaking, its transport managers and any other relevant person as may be determined by the Member State. Any reference in this Article to convictions, penalties or infringements shall include convictions, penalties or infringements of the undertaking itself, its transport managers and any other relevant person as may be determined by the Member State.\nThe conditions referred to in the first subparagraph shall include at least the following:\n(a)\nthat there be no compelling grounds for doubting the good repute of the transport manager or the transport undertaking, such as convictions or penalties for any serious infringement of national rules in force in the fields of:\n(i)\ncommercial law;\n(ii)\ninsolvency law;\n(iii)\npay and employment conditions in the profession;\n(iv)\nroad traffic;\n(v)\nprofessional liability;\n(vi)\ntrafficking in human beings or drugs; and\n(b)\nthat the transport manager or the transport undertaking have not in one or more Member States been convicted of a serious criminal offence or incurred a penalty for a serious infringement of Community rules relating in particular to:\n(i)\nthe driving time and rest periods of drivers, working time and the installation and use of recording equipment;\n(ii)\nthe maximum weights and dimensions of commercial vehicles used in international traffic;\n(iii)\nthe initial qualification and continuous training of drivers;\n(iv)\nthe roadworthiness of commercial vehicles, including the compulsory technical inspection of motor vehicles;\n(v)\naccess to the market in international road haulage or, as appropriate, access to the market in road passenger transport;\n(vi)\nsafety in the carriage of dangerous goods by road;\n(vii)\nthe installation and use of speed-limiting devices in certain categories of vehicle;\n(viii)\ndriving licences;\n(ix)\nadmission to the occupation;\n(x)\nanimal transport.\n2.   For the purposes of point (b) of the third subparagraph of paragraph 1:\n(a)\nwhere the transport manager or the transport undertaking has in one or more Member States been convicted of a serious criminal offence or incurred a penalty for one of the most serious infringements of Community rules as set out in Annex IV, the competent authority of the Member State of establishment shall carry out in an appropriate and timely manner a duly completed administrative procedure, which shall include, if appropriate, a check at the premises of the undertaking concerned.\nThe procedure shall determine whether, due to specific circumstances, the loss of good repute would constitute a disproportionate response in the individual case. Any such finding shall be duly reasoned and justified.\nIf the competent authority finds that the loss of good repute would constitute a disproportionate response, it may decide that good repute is unaffected. In such case, the reasons shall be recorded in the national register. The number of such decisions shall be indicated in the report referred to in Article 26(1).\nIf the competent authority does not find that the loss of good repute would constitute a disproportionate response, the conviction or penalty shall lead to the loss of good repute;\n(b)\nthe Commission shall draw up a list of categories, types and degrees of seriousness of serious infringements of Community rules which, in addition to those set out in Annex IV, may lead to the loss of good repute. Member States shall take into account information on those infringements, including information received from other Member States, when setting the priorities for checks pursuant to Article 12(1).\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it and which relate to this list, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).\nTo this end, the Commission shall:\n(i)\nlay down the categories and types of infringement which are most frequently encountered;\n(ii)\ndefine the degree of seriousness of infringements according to their potential to create a risk of fatalities or serious injuries; and\n(iii)\nprovide the frequency of occurrence beyond which repeated infringements shall be regarded as more serious, by taking into account the number of drivers used for the transport activities managed by the transport manager.\n3.   The requirement laid down in Article 3(1)(b) shall not be satisfied until a rehabilitation measure or any other measure having an equivalent effect has been taken pursuant to the relevant provisions of national law.\nArticle 7\nConditions relating to the requirement of financial standing\n1.   In order to satisfy the requirement laid down in Article 3(1)(c), an undertaking shall at all times be able to meet its financial obligations in the course of the annual accounting year. To this end, the undertaking shall demonstrate, on the basis of annual accounts certified by an auditor or a duly accredited person, that, every year, it has at its disposal capital and reserves totalling at least EUR 9 000 when only one vehicle is used and EUR 5 000 for each additional vehicle used.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the value of the euro in the currencies of Member States which do not participate in the third stage of the economic and monetary union shall be fixed every year. The rates to be applied shall be those obtained on the first working day of October and published in the Official Journal of the European Union. They shall have effect from 1 January of the following calendar year.\nThe accounting items referred to in the first subparagraph shall be understood as those defined in Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (9).\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the competent authority may agree or require that an undertaking demonstrate its financial standing by means of a certificate such as a bank guarantee or an insurance, including a professional liability insurance from one or more banks or other financial institutions, including insurance companies, providing a joint and several guarantee for the undertaking in respect of the amounts specified in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1.\n3.   The annual accounts referred to in paragraph 1, and the guarantee referred to in paragraph 2, which are to be verified, are those of the economic entity established in the Member State in which an authorisation has been applied for and not those of any other entity established in any other Member State.\nArticle 8\nConditions relating to the requirement of professional competence\n1.   In order to satisfy the requirement laid down in Article 3(1)(d), the person or persons concerned shall possess knowledge corresponding to the level provided for in Part I of Annex I in the subjects listed therein. That knowledge shall be demonstrated by means of a compulsory written examination which, if a Member State so decides, may be supplemented by an oral examination. Those examinations shall be organised in accordance with Part II of Annex I. To this end, Member States may decide to impose training prior to the examination.\n2.   The persons concerned shall sit the examination in the Member State in which they have their normal residence or the Member State in which they work.\n‘Normal residence’ shall mean the place where a person usually lives, that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal ties which show close links between that person and the place where he is living.\nHowever, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a different place from his personal ties and who, consequently, lives in turn in different places situated in two or more Member States, shall be regarded as being in the place of his personal ties, provided that such person returns there regularly. This last condition shall not be required where the person is living in a Member State in order to carry out a task of a definite duration. Attendance at a university or school shall not imply transfer of normal residence.\n3.   Only the authorities or bodies duly authorised for this purpose by a Member State, in accordance with criteria defined by it, may organise and certify the written and oral examinations referred to in paragraph 1. Member States shall regularly verify that the conditions under which those authorities or bodies organise the examinations are in accordance with Annex I.\n4.   Member States may duly authorise, in accordance with criteria defined by them, bodies to provide applicants with high-quality training to prepare them for the examinations and transport managers with continuous training to update their knowledge if they wish to do so. Such Member States shall regularly verify that these bodies at all times fulfil the criteria on the basis of which they were authorised.\n5.   Member States may promote periodic training on the subjects listed in Annex I at 10-year intervals to ensure that transport managers are aware of developments in the sector.\n6.   Member States may require persons who possess a certificate of professional competence, but who have not managed a road haulage undertaking or a road passenger transport undertaking in the last 5 years, to undertake retraining in order to update their knowledge regarding the current developments of the legislation referred to in Part I of Annex I.\n7.   A Member State may exempt the holders of certain higher education qualifications or technical education qualifications issued in that Member State, specifically designated to this end and entailing knowledge of all the subjects listed in Annex I from the examination in the subjects covered by those qualifications. The exemption shall only apply to those sections of Part I of Annex I for which the qualification covers all subjects listed under the heading of each section.\nA Member State may exempt from specified parts of the examinations holders of certificates of professional competence valid for national transport operations in that Member State.\n8.   A certificate issued by the authority or body referred to in paragraph 3 shall be produced as proof of professional competence. That certificate shall not be transferable to any other person. It shall be drawn up in accordance with the security features and the model certificate set out in Annexes II and III and shall bear the seal of the duly authorised authority or body which issued it.\n9.   The Commission shall adapt Annexes I, II and III to technical progress. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).\n10.   The Commission shall encourage and facilitate the exchange of experience and information between Member States, or through any body it may designate, concerning training, examinations and authorisations.\nArticle 9\nExemption from examination\nMember States may decide to exempt from the examinations referred to in Article 8(1) persons who provide proof that they have continuously managed a road haulage undertaking or a road passenger transport undertaking in one or more Member States for the period of 10 years before 4 December 2009.\nCHAPTER III\nAUTHORISATION AND MONITORING\nArticle 10\nCompetent authorities\n1.   Each Member State shall designate one or more competent authorities to ensure the correct implementation of this Regulation. Those competent authorities shall be empowered to:\n(a)\nexamine applications made by undertakings;\n(b)\ngrant authorisations to engage in the occupation of road transport operator, and suspend or withdraw such authorisations;\n(c)\ndeclare a natural person to be unfit to manage the transport activities of an undertaking in the capacity of transport manager;\n(d)\ncarry out the requisite checks to verify whether an undertaking satisfies the requirements laid down in Article 3.\n2.   The competent authorities shall publish all the conditions laid down pursuant to this Regulation, any other national provisions, the procedures to be followed by interested applicants and the corresponding explanations.\nArticle 11\nExamination and registration of applications\n1.   A transport undertaking which complies with the requirements laid down in Article 3 shall, upon application, be authorised to engage in the occupation of road transport operator. The competent authority shall ascertain that an undertaking which submits an application satisfies the requirements laid down in that Article.\n2.   The competent authority shall record in the national electronic register referred to in Article 16 the data relating to undertakings which it authorises and which are referred to in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 16(2).\n3.   The time limit for the examination of an application for authorisation by a competent authority shall be as short as possible and shall not exceed 3 months from the date on which the competent authority receives all documents necessary to assess the application. The competent authority may extend this time limit for one additional month in duly justified cases.\n4.   Until 31 December 2012, the competent authority shall verify, in case of any doubt when assessing the good repute of an undertaking, whether at the time of application the designated transport manager or managers are declared, in one of the Member States, unfit to manage the transport activities of an undertaking pursuant to Article 14.\nFrom 1 January 2013, when assessing the good repute of an undertaking, the competent authority shall verify, by accessing the data referred to in point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 16(2), either by direct secure access to the relevant part of the national registers or by request, whether at the time of the application the designated transport manager or managers are declared, in one of the Member States, unfit to manage the transport activities of an undertaking pursuant to Article 14.\nMeasures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and relating to a postponement for a maximum of 3 years of the dates referred to in this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).\n5.   Undertakings with an authorisation to engage in the occupation of road transport operator shall, within a period of 28 days or less, as determined by the Member State of establishment, notify the competent authority which granted the authorisation of any changes to the data referred to in paragraph 2.\nArticle 12\nChecks\n1.   Competent authorities shall monitor whether undertakings which they have authorised to engage in the occupation of road transport operator continue to fulfil the requirements laid down in Article 3. To that end, Member States shall carry out checks targeting those undertakings which are classed as posing an increased risk. For that purpose, Member States shall extend the risk classification system established by them pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities (10) to cover all infringements specified in Article 6 of this Regulation.\n2.   Until 31 December 2014, Member States shall carry out checks at least every 5 years to verify that undertakings fulfil the requirements laid down in Article 3.\nMeasures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and relating to a postponement of the date referred to in the first subparagraph shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).\n3.   Member States shall carry out individual checks to verify whether an undertaking meets the conditions governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator whenever the Commission so requests in duly motivated cases.

and\nhave the required professional competence.\nTransport manager\nEvery road transport company must designate a transport manager who is responsible for continuously managing its transport activities. This manager must reside in the EU and have a genuine link to the undertaking, for example as an employee, administrator or shareholder.\nHow to become a road transport operator\nA company wanting to be active in the road transport operator business must be established in an EU country with premises in that EU country where it can keep all of the documents (accounts, personnel management documents and data relating to driving time and rest, etc.) required for its business.\nThe company should have at least one vehicle registered in that EU country at its disposal (once an authorisation has been granted) and have an operating centre situated in that country with the appropriate technical equipment and facilities for the operation of the vehicle(s).\nIn addition: neither the company nor the manager can have been convicted for any infringement of certain national and EU rules relating to road transport;the company must be able to meet its financial obligations;the manager must have passed a compulsory written examination, which may be supplemented by an oral examination.\nAuthorisation and monitoring\nEU countries must designate one or more competent authorities responsible for: examining applications made by companies;granting permits to set up as a road transport operator;declaring a person to be fit/unfit to manage a company’s transport activities;checking that the company fulfils all the relevant requirements.\nThe competent authorities are also responsible for following up companies’ applications for registration within 3 months. In addition, they can declare a company unfit to manage transport activities.\nSimplification and administrative cooperation\nEach EU country must keep a national electronic register of companies authorised to be active in the road transport operator business. The competent national authorities are responsible for supervising the data in that register.\nThe national registers are to be interconnected, allowing the competent authorities of any EU country to consult the national electronic register of any other EU country.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055\nThe main changes introduced to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 by amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 include the following.\nReplacing the article on conditions relating to the requirement of a transport undertaking being established (Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009) in order to combat the phenomenon of letterbox companies. It thus tightens the link between the transport operator’s place of establishment and its activities.\nExtending the rules to cover vans used in international transport (light commercial vehicles weighing over 2.5 tonnes).\nRequiring the European Commission to adopt implementing acts laying down a list of categories, types and degrees of gravity of serious infringements of EU rules.\nIntroducing new administrative procedures where a transport manager or a company has seriously infringed EU rules.\nIntroducing new rules concerning a haulier’s good repute: the minimum period after which transport managers who have lost their good repute can have it restored is 1 year. Managers who have lost their good repute must prove that they have followed a minimum level of training or passed an examination demonstrating knowledge of the subjects listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009.\nRevising Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 clarifying the most serious infringements.\nRequiring transport companies to demonstrate, on the basis of annual accounts certified by an auditor or a duly accredited person, that for each year it has specific levels of capital and reserves at its disposal.\nFROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?\nRegulation (EC) No 1071/2009 has applied since 4 December 2011.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 will apply from 21 February 2022.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nRules governing access to the profession (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nLetterbox companies: companies which have been set up with the purpose of benefitting from legislative loopholes while not providing any service to clients themselves, but rather providing a front for services provided by their owners (COM(2013) 122 final).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and repealing Council Directive 96/26/EC (OJ L 300, 14.11.2009, pp. 51-71)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
