INTRODUCTION\nAt its meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, the European Council decided that the Accession Partnership would be the key feature of the enhanced pre-accession strategy, mobilising all forms of assistance to the candidate countries within a single framework. In this manner, the Community targets its assistance towards the specific needs of each candidate so as to provide support for overcoming particular problems with a view to accession.\nThe first Accession Partnership for Turkey was adopted by the Council in March 2001. In the Commission’s Strategy Paper on enlargement of October 2002, it was stated that the Commission would propose a revised Accession Partnership for Turkey. A revised Accession Partnership was then presented by the Commission in March 2003 and adopted by the Council in May of the same year. In its recommendation of October 2004 the Commission proposed that, with a view to guaranteeing the sustainability and irreversibility of the political reform process, the EU should continue to monitor closely progress of the political reforms. In particular, the Commission proposed the adoption of a revised Accession Partnership in 2005 which was adopted by the Council in January 2006. Following the expected progress in the implementation of the short-term priorities of the Partnerships, it is the practice to update the partnerships every other year. Therefore, the Commission proposes to renew the Accession Partnership.\nTurkey should develop a plan including a timetable and specific measures intended to address the Accession Partnership priorities.\nThe revised Accession Partnership provides the basis for a number of policy/financial instruments which will be used to help Turkey in the preparations for membership. In particular, the revised Accession Partnership will serve as a basis for future political reforms and as a yardstick against which to measure future progress.\n2.   PRINCIPLES\nThe main priorities identified for Turkey relate to its capacity to meet the criteria defined by the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 and the requirements of the negotiating framework adopted by the Council on 3 October 2005.\n3.   PRIORITIES\nThe priorities listed in this Accession Partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that the country can complete them or take them substantially forward over the next few years. A distinction is made between short-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within one to two years, and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within three to four years. The priorities concern both legislation and the implementation thereof.\nThe revised Accession Partnership indicates the priority areas for Turkey’s membership preparations. Turkey will, nevertheless, ultimately have to address all the issues identified in the progress reports, including consolidating the political reform process in order to guarantee its irreversibility and ensure its uniform implementation throughout the country and at all levels of the administration. It is also important that Turkey fulfil the commitments of legislative approximation and implementation of the acquis in accordance with the commitments made under the Association Agreement, Customs Union and related decisions of the EC-Turkey Association Council, for example on the trade regime for agricultural products.\n3.1.

PROGRAMMING\nFinancial assistance for the priorities identified in the Accession Partnership will be made available through two financial instruments: programmes adopted before and in 2006 will be implemented in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001 of 17 December 2001 concerning pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey (3). Programmes and projects adopted as from 2007 will be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006. Under both instruments, the Commission has adopted respectively will adopt financing decisions, followed by a financing agreements signed by the Commission and Turkey. The financing agreements serve as legal basis for the implementation of the concrete programmes.\nTurkey has also access to funding from multi-country and horizontal programmes.\n5.   CONDITIONALITY\nCommunity assistance for financing projects through the pre-accession instruments is conditional on the respect by Turkey of its commitments under the EC-Turkey Agreements, including Customs Union Decision 1/95 and other decisions, further concrete steps towards satisfying effectively the Copenhagen criteria and, in particular, progress in meeting the specific priorities of this revised Accession Partnership.\nFailure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council to suspend financial assistance on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001 or on the basis of Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006. Specific conditions are also included in individual annual programmes. The financing decisions will be followed by a financing agreement signed with Turkey.\n6.   MONITORING\nThe implementation of the Accession Partnership shall be examined using the mechanisms established under the Association Agreement as appropriate and through the Commission’s progress reports.\nThe Association Agreement sub-committees provide the possibility of reviewing implementation of the Accession Partnership priorities and progress as regards legal approximation, implementation and enforcement. The Association Committee discusses overall developments, progress and problems in meeting the Accession Partnership priorities as well as more specific issues referred to it by the sub-committees.\nThe monitoring of the pre-accession financial assistance programmes shall be carried out jointly by Turkey and the Commission through a joint monitoring committee (JMC)/IPA Monitoring Committee. In order to ensure the effectiveness of monitoring, projects being funded under each financing agreement must incorporate verifiable and measurable indicators of achievements. Monitoring based on these indicators will assist the Commission, the JMC/IPA Monitoring Committee and Turkey in subsequently reorienting programmes where necessary and in the design of new programmes. The JMC/IPA Monitoring Committee ensures that actions financed under the pre-accession programmes are compatible with the Accession Partnership.\nThe Accession Partnership will continue to be adjusted as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 390/2001.\n(1)  See also the declaration by the European Community and its Member States of 21 September 2005.\n(2)  OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22.

The Partnership places particular emphasis on political criteria. It covers in detail the priorities for Turkey’s accession preparations, with particular reference to implementation of the acquis, and provides a reference framework for directing pre-accession assistance.\nACT\nCouncil Decision 2008/157/EC of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with the Republic of Turkey and repealing Decision 2006/35/EC.\nSUMMARY\nThe Accession Partnership, which is based on the pre-accession strategy, is the main instrument providing Turkey with guidance in its preparations for accession.\nThe Helsinki European Council (December 1999) decided to recognise Turkey as an applicant for accession on the basis of criteria equivalent to those applied to the other applicant countries. The accession negotiations were started on 3 October 2005.\nThe pre-accession strategy combines the frameworks and different instruments relating to the accession process of a new Member State, offering Turkey a coherent accession programme and enabling it to familiarise itself with the European Union's procedures and policies, notably by giving it the opportunity to participate in Community programmes.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the Accession Partnership is to incorporate in a single legal framework:\nthe priorities for reform with a view to preparing for accession;\nguidelines for financial assistance for action in these priority areas;\nthe principles and conditions governing implementation of the Partnership.\nThe Accession Partnership with Turkey was established in 2001 and has been revised three times (in 2003, 2006 and 2008). It evolves as the country progresses and continues its efforts to prepare for accession.\nWith a view to achieving the objectives identified in the Accession Partnership, Turkey adopted a national programme for transposing the Community acquis (NPAA), in which it sets out procedures and a programme for implementing action in the priority areas.\nPRIORITIES\nA distinction is made between short-term priorities, which are expected to be achieved within one to two years, and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be achieved within three to four years. Both are based primarily on Turkey's ability to comply with:\nthe 1993 Copenhagen Criteria;\nthe negotiation framework adopted on 3 October 2005.\nThe short and medium-term priorities are:\npolitical dialogue, which includes short-term priorities such as: democracy and the rule of law (public service, civilian oversight of security forces, the judicial system and anti-corruption policy), human rights and protection of minorities – which imply that these rights are promoted and respected at national and international level (civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, the situation in the east and southeast, displaced persons) – regional issues and international obligations (Cyprus, peaceful settlement of border disputes, Association Agreement);\neconomic criteria: market liberalisation, the fight against the underground economy, completion of the privatisation programme, improvement of the business climate, competitiveness, sustainability of public finances, budgetary and monetary policies guaranteeing macroeconomic stability, a coordinated economic policy and improvement of health and education levels and infrastructures and the correction of labour market imbalances;\nability to assume the obligations of membership, namely the adoption and implementation of the acquis (EU policies and legislation, both primary and secondary).\nEvaluation\nThe Commission regularly evaluates the progress made by Turkey on the priorities set by the Accession Partnership and in the areas in which greater efforts have to be made. Such evaluation covers compliance with the accession criteria, including adoption and enforcement of the acquis. The Accession Partnership is monitored and its implementation evaluated under the Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey.\nFINANCIAL FRAMEWORK\nTurkey receives financial assistance under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) for the period 2007‑2013. The Multi-annual Indicative Financial Framework for the period 2009‑2011 (MIIF) sets out the amount of assistance allocated to Turkey under the IPA: approximately EUR 3 037.9 million (including 2007 and 2008).\nCommunity assistance is subject to compliance with the essential elements governing bilateral relations between Turkey and the EU, the Copenhagen criteria and the priorities defined by the partnership. If these elements are not complied with, the financial assistance may be suspended by the Council.\nTurkey is also eligible for funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB) under its external lending mandate for the EU’s south-eastern neighbours.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2008/157/EC\n29.2.2008\n-\nOJ L 51 of 26.2.2008\nRELATED ACTS\nConclusions of the Brussels European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 (FR).\nThe European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Turkey on 3 October 2005.\nBILATERAL RELATIONS\nEEC‑Turkey Association Agreement (1963) [Official Journal No 217 of 29 December 1964].\nAdditional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey following the enlargement of the European Union [Official Journal L 254 of 30 September 2005].\nFINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 of 17 July 2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) [OJ L 210 of 31 July 2006].\nMulti-annual Indicative Financial Framework (CFIP) for:\n2008‑2010 [COM(2006) 672 final – Not published in the Official Journal];\n2009‑2011 [COM(2007) 689 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nEVALUATION\nReports\nare available on the website of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Enlargement.\nLast updated: 29.05.2008", "tags": ["accession to the European Union", "Türkiye", "cooperation agreement (EU)", "accession criteria", "financial aid"], "subjects": ["Accession", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32008D0157_p1": {"text": "Council decision 2008/157/ec of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with the Republic of Turkey and repealing decision 2006/35/ec.", "triples": [" decision 2008/157/ec,  repealing,  decision 2006/35/ec"]}}}
