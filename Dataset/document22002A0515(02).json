For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the Community:(a) products wholly obtained in the Community within the meaning of Article 4 of this Protocol;(b) products obtained in the Community incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Community within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol.2. For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in Jordan:(a) products wholly obtained in Jordan within the meaning of Article 4 of this Protocol;(b) products obtained in Jordan incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in Jordan within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol.Article 3Bilateral cumulation of origin1. Materials originating in the Community shall be considered as materials originating in Jordan when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6(1) of this Protocol.2. Materials originating in Jordan shall be considered as materials originating in the Community when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6(1) of this Protocol.Article 4Wholly obtained products1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the Community or Jordan:(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;(b) vegetable products harvested there;(c) live animals born and raised there;(d) products from live animals raised there;(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;(f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the Community or Jordan by their vessels;(g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);(h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;(i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;(j) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;(k) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (j).2.

For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:(a) their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;(b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply except as provided in Article 6.Article 6Insufficient working or processing operations1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:(a) operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;(c) (i) changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of packages;(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packaging operations;(d) affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;(e) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds, where one or more components of the mixtures does not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating in the Community or Jordan;(f) simple assembly of parts to constitute a complete product;(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);(h) slaughter of animals.2. All the operations carried out in either the Community or Jordan on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.Article 7Unit of qualification1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.Accordingly, it follows that:(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.2. Where, under general rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.Article 8Accessories, spare parts and toolsAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.Article 9SetsSets, as defined in general rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.Article 10Neutral elementsIn order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:(a) energy and fuel;(b) plant and equipment;(c) machines and tools;(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.TITLE IIITERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTSArticle 11Principle of territoriality1. The conditions set out in Title II relative to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or Jordan.2. If originating goods exported from the Community or Jordan to another country are returned, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(a) the goods returned are the same goods as those exported; and(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.Article 12Direct transport1. The preferential treatment provided for under the Agreement applies only to products, satisfying the requirements of this Protocol, which are transported directly between the Community and Jordan. However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.Originating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the Community or Jordan.2.

Originating products, sent for exhibition in another country and sold after the exhibition for importation in the Community or Jordan shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(a) an exporter has consigned these products from the Community or Jordan to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Community or Jordan;(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and(d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.2. A proof of origin must be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.TITLE IVDRAWBACK OR EXEMPTIONArticle 14Prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties1. Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the Community or in Jordan for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in the Community or Jordan to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the Community or Jordan to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there.3. The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 7(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 8 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 9 when such items are non-originating.5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which the Agreement applies. Furthermore, they shall not preclude the application of an export refund system for agricultural products, applicable upon export in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.6. The provisions of this Article shall not apply for four years following the entry into force of the Agreement. These provisions may be reviewed by common accord.TITLE VPROOF OF ORIGINArticle 15General requirements1.

The issuing customs authorities shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in box 11 of the certificate.7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.Article 17Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively1. Notwithstanding Article 16(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:(a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or(b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file.4. Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with one of the following phrases:\"NACHTRÄGLICH AUSGESTELLT\", \"DÉLIVRÉ A POSTERIORI\", \"RILASCIATO A POSTERIORI\", \"AFGEGEVEN A POSTERIORI\", \"ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY\", \"UDSTEDT EFTERFØLGENDE\", \"ΕΚΔΟΘΕΝ ΕΚ ΤΩΝ ΥΣΤΕΡΩΝ\", \"EXPEDIDO A POSTERIORI\", \"EMITIDO A POSTERIORI\", \"ANNETTU JÄLKIKÄTEEN\", \"UTFÄRDAT I EFTERHAND\", \">PIC FILE= \"L_2002129EN.007401.TIF\">\".5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the \"Remarks\" box of the movement certificate EUR.1.Article 18Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.11. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with one of the following words:\"DUPLIKAT\", \"DUPLICATA\", \"DUPLICATO\", \"DUPLICAAT\", \"DUPLICATE\", \"ΑΝΤΙΓΡΑΦΟ\", \"DUPLICADO\", \"SEGUNDA VIA\", \"KAKSOISKAPPALE\", \">PIC FILE= \"L_2002129EN.007402.TIF\">\".3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the \"Remarks\" box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.Article 19Issue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previouslyWhen originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the Community or Jordan, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the Community or Jordan. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.Article 20Conditions for making out an invoice declaration1. An invoice declaration as referred to in Article 15(1)(b) may be made out:(a) by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 21; or(b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed ECU 6000.2. An invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or Jordan and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.3. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.4. An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.5. Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 21 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.6. An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.Article 21Approved exporter1. The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter who makes frequent shipments of products under this Agreement to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.2. The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.3. The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the invoice declaration.4. The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.5. The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, does not fulfil the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.Article 22Validity of proof of origin1. A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.Article 23Submission of proof of originProofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of the Agreement.Article 24Importation by instalmentsWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country; dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of general rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within sections XVI and XVII or heading Nos 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.Article 25Exemptions from proof of origin1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration C2/CP3 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed ECU 500 in the case of small packages or ECU 1200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.Article 26Supporting documentsThe documents referred to in Articles 16(3) and 20(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in the Community or in Jordan and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist, inter alia, of the following:(a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal bookkeeping;(b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or Jordan where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;(c) documents proving the working or processing of materials in the Community or Jordan, issued or made out in the Community or Jordan, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;(d) movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or Jordan in accordance with this Protocol.Article 27Preservation of proof of origin and supporting documents1. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the documents referred to in Article 16(3).2. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall keep for at least three years a copy of this invoice declaration as well as the documents referred to in Article 20(3).3. The customs authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in Article 16(2).4. The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them.Article 28Discrepancies and formal errors1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.Article 29Amounts expressed in ECU1. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting country equivalent to the amounts expressed in ECU shall be fixed by the exporting country and communicated to the importing countries through the Commission of the European Communities.2. When the amounts exceed the corresponding amounts fixed by the importing country, the latter shall accept them if the products are invoiced in the currency of the exporting country. When the products are invoiced in the currency of another EC Member State, the importing country shall recognise the amount notified by the country concerned.3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the amounts expressed in ECU as at the first working day in October 1996.4. The amounts expressed in ECU and their equivalents in the national currencies of the EC Member States and Jordan shall be reviewed by the Association Committee at the request of the Community or Jordan. When carrying out this review, the Association Committee shall ensure that there will be no decrease in the amounts to be used in any national currency and shall furthermore consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in ECU.TITLE VIARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATIONArticle 30Mutual assistance1. The customs authorities of the EC Member States and of Jordan shall provide each other, through the Commission of the European Communities, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations.2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Community and Jordan shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 or the invoice declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.Article 31Verification of proofs of origin1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or in Jordan and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.Article 32Dispute settlementWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 31 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Association Committee.In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.Article 33PenaltiesPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.Article 34Free zones1. The Community and Jordan shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or Jordan are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.TITLE VIICEUTA AND MELILLAArticle 35Application of the Protocol1. The term \"Community\" used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta and Melilla.2. Products originating in Jordan, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities. Jordan shall grant to imports of products covered by the Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community.3. For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 36.Article 36Special conditions1. Providing they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, the following shall be considered as:1. products originating in Ceuta and Melilla:(a) products wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;(b) products obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol; or that(ii) those products are originating in Jordan or in the Community within the meaning of this Protocol, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the insufficient working or processing referred to in Article 6(1).2. products originating in Jordan:(a) products wholly obtained in Jordan;(b) products obtained in Jordan, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol; or that(ii) those products are originating in Ceuta and Melilla or in the Community within the meaning of this Protocol, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the insufficient working or processing referred to in Article 6(1).2. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.3. The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter \"Jordan\" and \"Ceuta and Melilla\" in box 2 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations. In addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in box 4 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations.4. The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.TITLE VIIIFINAL PROVISIONSArticle 37Amendments to the ProtocolThe Association Committee may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.Article 38Implementation of the ProtocolThe Community and Jordan shall each take the steps necessary to implement this Protocol.Article 39Goods in transit or storageThe provisions of the Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Protocol and which on the date of entry into force of the Agreement are either in transit or are in the Community or in Jordan or, in temporary storage in bonded warehouses or in free zones, subject to the submission to the customs authorities of the importing State, within four months of that date, of a movement certificate EUR.1 issued retrospectively by the competent authorities of the exporting State together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly.ANNEX IIntroductory notes to the list in Annex IINote 1The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of the Protocol.Note 22.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.Note 33.1. The provisions of Article 5 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in Jordan.ExampleAn engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading No  ex 7224.If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No  ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.3.3. Without prejudice to note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No ...\" means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.ExampleThe rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also note 6.2 in relation to textiles).ExampleThe rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.ExampleIn the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth, even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn, that is the fibre stage.3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.Note 44.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.Note 55.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (see also notes 5.3 and 5.4).5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.The following are the basic textile materials:- silk,- wool,- coarse animal hair,- fine animal hair,- horsehair,- cotton,- paper-making materials and paper,- flax,- true hemp,- jute and other textile bast fibres,- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,- synthetic man-made filaments,- artificial man-made filaments,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,- other synthetic man-made staple fibres,- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,- other artificial man-made staple fibres,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,- products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,- other products of heading No 5605.ExampleA yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the yarn.ExampleA woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.ExampleTufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.ExampleIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.ExampleA carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the textile materials of the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.Note 66.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.6.2. Without prejudice to note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.ExampleIf a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide fasteners even though slide fasteners normally contain textiles.6.3. Where a percentage rules applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.Note 77.1. For the purposes of heading Nos  ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(1);(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(i) isomerisation;7.2. For the purposes of heading Nos  ex 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(2);(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(ij) isomerisation;(k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No  ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);(l) in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;(m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No  ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction.The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No  ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;(n) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No  ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C by the ASTM D 86 method;(o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No  ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brushdischarge.7.3. For the purposes of heading Nos  ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.(1) See additional explanatory note 4(b) to Chapter 27 of the Combined Nomenclature.(2) See additional explanatory note 4(b) to Chapter 27 of the Combined Nomenclature.ANNEX IIList of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order that the product manufactured can obtain originating statusThe products mentioned in the list may not all be covered by the Agreement.

Assistance in customs matters, as provided for in this Protocol, shall apply to any administrative authority of the Parties which is competent for the application of this Protocol.

Nor shall it cover information obtained under powers exercised at the request of the judicial authorities, unless those authorities so agree.Article 3Assistance on request1.

In order to comply with a request for assistance, the requested authority shall proceed, within the limits of its competence and available resources, as though it were acting on its own account or at the request of other authorities of that same Party, by supplying information already possessed, by carrying out appropriate enquiries or by arranging for them to be carried out. This provision shall also apply to the administrative department to which the request has been addressed by the requested authority when the latter cannot act on its own.2. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the laws, rules and other legal instruments of the requested Party.3. Duly authorised officials of a Party may, with the agreement of the other Party involved and subject to the conditions laid down by the latter, obtain from the offices of the requested authority or other authority for which the requested authority is responsible, information relating to operations which are or may be in breach of customs legislation which the applicant authority needs for the purposes of this Protocol.4.

Where the applicant authority requests assistance which it would itself be unable to provide if so asked, it shall draw attention to that fact in its request.
