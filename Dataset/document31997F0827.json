The presidency of the Council then chooses three experts from the pool of names to conduct an evaluation of an EU country, while ensuring that the three experts in question are not nationals of the EU country under evaluation.\nEach round of evaluations focuses on a specific topic agreed by the EU countries. They also agree on the order of visits and on the questionnaire on the basis of which the evaluation team is to carry out its visit to each EU country. The aim is to gather all the information useful for conducting the evaluation. Following the completion of the questionnaire, the evaluation team visits the EU country in question meeting with relevant parties (e.g. political, administrative, police, customs and judicial authorities). Each EU country must ensure that its authorities cooperate fully with the evaluation teams set up under this joint action.\nThe draft report is submitted to the visited EU country for its opinion no later than 1 month after the visit. Once any changes are accepted and made, the presidency of the Council then forwards the draft report to members of the relevant Council working group for further consideration and adoption.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nJoint Action 97/827/JHA\n15.12.1997\n-\nOJ L 344, 15.12.1997, pp. 7-9\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nCouncil Decision 2002/996/JHA of 28 November 2002 establishing a mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism (Official Journal L 349, 24.12.2002, pp 1-3).\nlast update 02.07.2015", "tags": ["international cooperation", "organised crime", "project evaluation", "confidentiality"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
