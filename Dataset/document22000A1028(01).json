To achieve this, it institutionalises the political dialogue and steps up trade and economic relations by setting up a free trade area for goods and services. The Agreement is based on respect for human rights and democracy.\nACTS\nCouncil Decision 2000/658/EC of 28 September 2000 concerning the conclusion of the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part [see Amending acts].\nEconomic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part â Final Act â Declarations.\nSUMMARY\nThe Agreement, which was signed in 1997 and came into force in November 2000, covers several fields.\nThe first is political dialogue, which is institutionalised by the Agreement. This dialogue must cover all matters of common interest and lead to closer consultation within international organisations. The dialogue is conducted in accordance with the \"Joint Declaration by the European Union (EU) and Mexico on Political Dialogue\" annexed to the Final Act.\nTrade is also an integral part of the Agreement. It aims to encourage the development of trade and a bilateral and preferential, progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade. The Joint Council established by the Agreement decides on the arrangements and timetable for reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and on the arrangements for liberalising trade in services. The decisions of the Joint Council in this area enter into force as soon as they are adopted.\nAs regards capital movements and payments, the aim is to encourage their progressive and reciprocal liberalisation. In order to achieve this, the Joint Council must take decisions relating to the definition, content and scope of liberalisation, and on clauses allowing the introduction of possible justified restrictions.\nAnother title covers:\npublic procurement: the parties agree to the gradual opening of markets, under the supervision of the Joint Council;\ncompetition: the parties must take appropriate measures within the Joint Council to prevent distortions or restrictions of competition. Cooperation and coordination mechanisms are established to facilitate technical assistance, consultation and exchange of information;\nintellectual, industrial and commercial property: appropriate measures must be taken with a view to ensuring adequate and effective protection.\nThe area of cooperation as such covers several fields. The Agreement institutes a regular dialogue on cooperation and economic matters. Industrial cooperation aims to promote dynamic, integrated and decentralised management by strengthening contacts, dialogue and the promotion of pilot projects.\nThe exchange of information and training events are key cooperation elements in the areas of mining, energy, transport and tourism. In all cases, the main aim is the development of these sectors.\nThe aim of cooperation in financial services is to encourage greater, more diversified productivity and competitiveness. As regards the information society, cooperation focuses on dialogue, exchanges of information, the dissemination of new technologies, reciprocal access to databases, the interconnection and interoperability of telematic networks and services, and the promotion of joint research projects and pilot projects.\nThe aim of cooperation in the agricultural, food processing and rural sectors is also to promote trade. With a view to facilitating trade, the parties examine ways to harmonise health, plant health and environmental standards. Exchanging information and setting up projects and activities are other components of this cooperation.\nAnother area of cooperation is combating drug trafficking, money-laundering and chemical precursors. The parties must implement programmes and measures for the prevention of drug abuse, research projects and the exchange of information.\nA dialogue on social affairs and poverty is fundamental. The parties recognise the importance of harmonising economic and social development taking into account the need to respect basic rights, especially the rights of the most vulnerable groups. The Agreement also covers cooperation on human rights and democracy. It focuses on the development of civil society, measures relating to training and information, and the promotion of human rights and democratic values.\nIn the area of health, cooperation aims to strengthen activities in the fields of research, pharmacology, preventive medicine and communicable diseases.\nRegional cooperation encourages intra-regional trade, in particular with Central America and the Caribbean.\nOther areas of cooperation covered by the Agreement include investment promotion, cooperation on small and medium sized enterprises, technical regulations and conformity assessment, cooperation on statistics, government, cultural cooperation, cooperation in the audiovisual sector, information and communication, data protection, refugees and consumer protection.\nThe Agreement explicitly provides for the possibility of concluding sectoral agreements within the framework of cooperation in certain areas such as scientific and technological cooperation, training and education, the environment and the management of natural resources, and fisheries. It also provides for the possibility of concluding a Protocol on mutual assistance in the field of customs. The aim of cooperation in this area is to ensure fair trade through an improved and consolidated legal framework, exchanges of information, the development of training and coordination techniques, the simplification of procedures and exchanges of officials.\nInstitutional framework\nThe Agreement establishes a Joint Council whose role it is to supervise its implementation. It consists of the Members of the Council of the European Union, of the European Commission and of the Government of Mexico, and meets at regular intervals at ministerial level. It is presided in turn by a Member of the Council of the EU and a Member of the Government of Mexico, and takes decisions in the cases provided for in the Agreement. It is assisted by a Joint Committee and may decide to set up any other special committee or body which it deems necessary.\nFinal provisions\nThe Agreements also includes a clause on data protection and a national security clause.\nIt also specifies that most favoured nation treatment does not apply to tax advantages provided on the basis of agreements to avoid double taxation. Nothing in the Agreement may be construed in such a way as to impede the measures aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes.\nThe Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period and either party may denounce it by notifying the other party. It ceases to apply six months after the date of such notification.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nCouncil Decision 2000/658/EC\n1.10.2000\n-\nOJ L 276 of 28.10.2000\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nCouncil Decision 2005/202/EC\n-\n-\nOJ L 66 of 12.3.2005\nRELATED ACTS\nIMPLEMENTATION\nInterim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part - Final [Official Journal L 226 of 13.8.1998].\n               This Agreement, signed pending ratification of the overall Agreement, will allow the earliest possible implementation of its trade and trade-related provisions.
