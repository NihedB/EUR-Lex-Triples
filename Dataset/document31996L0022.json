whereas, in the interests of the consumer, the holding, administering to animals of any species and the placing on the market for that purpose of beta-agonists should be prohibited; whereas, moreover, the holding, administering to animals of any species and the placing on the market of stilbenes and thyrostatic substances should be prohibited and the use of other substances regulated;(7) Whereas, however, the administering of medicinal products based on beta-agonists may be authorized for well-defined therapeutic purposes, in the case of certain categories of bovine animals, equidae and pets;(8) Whereas, moreover, it is necessary to ensure that all consumers are able to acquire meat and foodstuffs derived therefrom under the same conditions of supply and that those products correspond as closely as possible to their concerns and expectations; whereas, given consumer sensitivity, this can only bring about an increase in the consumption of the products in question;(9) Whereas the prohibition on the use of hormonal substances for fattening purposes should continue to apply; whereas the use of certain substances for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes may be authorized but must be strictly controlled in order to prevent any misuse;(10) Whereas withdrawal periods are not harmonized at Community level and there are considerable differences between Member States, particularly as regards authorized veterinary medicinal products containing hormonal substances or beta-agonists; whereas, in the interests of harmonization, maximum withdrawal periods should therefore be set for such medicinal products;(11) Whereas, furthermore, live animals so treated for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes and the meat from such animals should not as a general rule be traded, since this could impair the effectiveness of the control arrangements of the scheme as a whole; whereas, however, derogations from the prohibition may, subject to certain conditions, be provided for in respect of intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of animals intended for breeding and breeding animals at the end of their reproductive life;(12) Whereas such derogations may be authorized where adequate guarantees are provided so as to prevent distortion of trade; whereas such guarantees must cover the products which may be used, the conditions governing their use and the checks to ensure that the conditions are complied with, particularly with regard to the necessary withdrawal period;(13) Whereas provision should be made for the effective verification of application of the provisions deriving from this Directive;(14) Whereas Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC should be repealed;(15) Whereas, if the illegal use of growth and productivity promoters in stockfarming is to be combated effectively in all Member States, action will have to be organized at Community level;(16) Whereas, on 18 January 1996, the European Parliament asked the Commission and the Council to continue opposing the importation into the Community of meat treated with hormones, requested the maintenance of the total ban on the use of growth promoters in stockfarming and, to that end, asked the Council to adopt without delay the Commission proposal on which the European Parliament had delivered its opinion on 19 April 1994,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 11. For the purposes of this Directive, the definitions of meat and meat products given in Directives 64/433/EEC (7), 71/118/EEC (8), 77/99/EEC (9), and 91/495/EEC (10), the definitions of aquaculture products given in Directive 91/493/EEC (11) and the definitions of veterinary medicinal products given in Directives 81/851/EEC (12) and 81/852/EEC (13) shall apply.2.

The substances, listed in Annex II, are:\nthyrostatic* substances;\nstilbenes, stilbene derivatives, their salts and esters;\noestradiol 17ß and its ester-like derivatives;\nbeta-agonists* (prohibited but derogations possible under certain circumstances).\nThere is also a list of provisionally prohibited substances in the directive’s Annex III: these comprise substances with an oestrogenic* (other than oestradiol 17ß and its ester-like derivatives), androgenic* or gestagenic* action (derogations possible).\nDirective 2003/74/EC amended Directive 96/22/EC, confirming the prohibition of hormones for growth promotion in animals. It also reduced substantially the circumstances under which oestradiol 17ß could be administered for other purposes to food-producing animals.\nDirective 2008/97/EC amended Directive 96/22/EC and limits the scope of Directive 96/22/EC only to food-producing animals, withdrawing the prohibitions for pet animals.\nAs oestradiol 17β is not essential in the production of food-producing animals (because of available alternatives) and in view of its potential risks to human health, it is completely prohibited for use in food-producing animals. Therefore the temporary exemptions which were provided for the use of oestradiol 17β are not renewed.\nProhibition\nThe directive prohibits:\nthe placing on the market of the substances listed above where they are to be administered to animals intended for human consumption (not including the therapeutic and zootechnical* exceptions);\nthe placing on the market and slaughter of animals containing these substances or residues of these substances;\nthe placing on the market of meats or products of animal origin containing these substances or residues of these substances;\nthe holding of these substances on a farm.\nExceptions\nSubstances with a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonist substances may not be administered to farm animals. However, specific substances with hormonal action and beta agonists may be used for therapeutic and zootechnical purposes, provided their use is controlled.\nImports\nThe EU prohibits the import of animals, meat or products of animal origin from non-EU countries that authorise the administration of these substances for growth promotion. However, the EU prohibition does not apply where these countries are able to offer an equivalent guarantee for exports such as a segregated breeding system.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 23 May 1996. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 July 1997.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nHormones in meat (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nThyrostatic: medicines that reduce (or stabilise) the production of thyroid hormones.\nOestrogenic: hormones that stimulate the development of female secondary sex characteristics (for example, lighter muscling and weight of cows than bulls), exert systemic effects such as growth and maturation of long bones and promote oestrus (i.e. a regularly occurring period of sexual receptivity) in female mammals.\nAndrogenic: hormones that control the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics.\nGestagenic: hormones that produce progestational (i.e. favouring gestation) effects in the uterus.\nZootechnical: the technology of animal husbandry (domestication and selective breeding of animals).\nBeta-agonist: drugs that relax muscles (for example, when giving birth) by stimulating beta-adrenoceptors.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of ß-agonists, and repealing Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC (OJ L 125, 23.5.1996, pp. 3-9)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 96/22/EC have been incorporated into the original document.

whereas, in the interests of the consumer, the holding, administering to animals of any species and the placing on the market for that purpose of beta-agonists should be prohibited; whereas, moreover, the holding, administering to animals of any species and the placing on the market of stilbenes and thyrostatic substances should be prohibited and the use of other substances regulated;(7) Whereas, however, the administering of medicinal products based on beta-agonists may be authorized for well-defined therapeutic purposes, in the case of certain categories of bovine animals, equidae and pets;(8) Whereas, moreover, it is necessary to ensure that all consumers are able to acquire meat and foodstuffs derived therefrom under the same conditions of supply and that those products correspond as closely as possible to their concerns and expectations; whereas, given consumer sensitivity, this can only bring about an increase in the consumption of the products in question;(9) Whereas the prohibition on the use of hormonal substances for fattening purposes should continue to apply; whereas the use of certain substances for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes may be authorized but must be strictly controlled in order to prevent any misuse;(10) Whereas withdrawal periods are not harmonized at Community level and there are considerable differences between Member States, particularly as regards authorized veterinary medicinal products containing hormonal substances or beta-agonists; whereas, in the interests of harmonization, maximum withdrawal periods should therefore be set for such medicinal products;(11) Whereas, furthermore, live animals so treated for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes and the meat from such animals should not as a general rule be traded, since this could impair the effectiveness of the control arrangements of the scheme as a whole; whereas, however, derogations from the prohibition may, subject to certain conditions, be provided for in respect of intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of animals intended for breeding and breeding animals at the end of their reproductive life;(12) Whereas such derogations may be authorized where adequate guarantees are provided so as to prevent distortion of trade; whereas such guarantees must cover the products which may be used, the conditions governing their use and the checks to ensure that the conditions are complied with, particularly with regard to the necessary withdrawal period;(13) Whereas provision should be made for the effective verification of application of the provisions deriving from this Directive;(14) Whereas directive 81/602/eec directive 88/146/eec directive 88/299/eec should be repealed;(15) Whereas, if the illegal use of growth and productivity promoters in stockfarming is to be combated effectively in all Member States, action will have to be organized at Community level;(16) Whereas, on 18 January 1996, the European Parliament asked the Commission and the Council to continue opposing the importation into the Community of meat treated with hormones, requested the maintenance of the total ban on the use of growth promoters in stockfarming and, to that end, asked the Council to adopt without delay the Commission proposal on which the European Parliament had delivered its opinion on 19 April 1994,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 11.
