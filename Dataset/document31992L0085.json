Appropriate measures must be taken in order to achieve further harmonization of conditions in this area while maintaining the improvements made`;Whereas the Commission, in its action programme for the implementation of the Community Charter of the fundamental social rights of workers, has included among its aims the adoption by the Council of a Directive on the protection of pregnant women at work;Whereas Article 15 of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5) provides that particularly sensitive risk groups must be protected against the dangers which specifically affect them;Whereas pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding must be considered a specific risk group in many respects, and measures must be taken with regard to their safety and health;Whereas the protection of the safety and health of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding should not treat women on the labour market unfavourably nor work to the detriment of directives concerning equal treatment for men and women;Whereas some types of activities may pose a specific risk, for pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding, of exposure to dangerous agents, processes or working conditions; whereas such risks must therefore be assessed and the result of such assessment communicated to female workers and/or their representatives;Whereas, further, should the result of this assessment reveal the existence of a risk to the safety or health of the female worker, provision must be made for such worker to be protected;Whereas pregnant workers and workers who are breastfeeding must not engage in activities which have been assessed as revealing a risk of exposure, jeopardizing safety and health, to certain particularly dangerous agents or working conditions;Whereas provision should be made for pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding not to be required to work at night where such provision is necessary from the point of view of their safety and health;Whereas the vulnerability of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding makes it necessary for them to be granted the right to maternity leave of at least 14 continuous weeks, allocated before and/or after confinement, and renders necessary the compulsory nature of maternity leave of at least two weeks, allocated before and/or after confinement;Whereas the risk of dismissal for reasons associated with their condition may have harmful effects on the physical and mental state of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding; whereas provision should be made for such dismissal ot be prohibited;Whereas measures for the organization of work concerning the protection of the health of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding would serve no purpose unless accompanied by the maintenance of rights linked to the employment contract, including maintenance of payment and/or entitlement to an adequate allowance;Whereas, moreover, provision concerning maternity leave would also serve no purpose unless accompanied by the maintenance of rights linked to the employment contract and or entitlement to an adequate allowance;Whereas the concept of an adequate allowance in the case of maternity leave must be regarded as a technical point of reference with a view to fixing the minimum level of protection and should in no circumstances be interpreted as suggesting an analogy between pregnancy and illness,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVESECTION I PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONSArticle 1Purpose1.

Such a reference is not intended in any way to imply that pregnancy and childbirth be equated with sickness. The national social security legislation of all Member States provides for an allowance to be paid during an absence from work due to sickness. The link with such allowance in the chosen formulation is simply intended to serve as a concrete, fixed reference amount in all Member States for the determination of the minimum amount of maternity allowance payable. In so far as allowances are paid in individual Member States which exceed those provided for in the Directive, such allowances are, of course, retained. This is clear from Article 1 (3) of the Directive.`.", "summary": "Protecting pregnant workers and new mothers\nProtecting pregnant workers and new mothers\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt aims to protect the health and safety of women in the workplace when pregnant* or after they have recently given birth*, and women who are breastfeeding*.\nKEY POINTS\nEU Member States must inform employers and female workers of the European Commission's guidelines regarding risks to health and safety at work posed by hazardous substances and industrial processes.\nWhere risks are identified, employers mustact to protect female workers concerned, for instance, by moving them to another position or granting leave.\nWhere leave is granted, the employer must guarantee employment rights and payment of an adequate allowance to compensate for any loss of income.\nPregnant workers are not obliged to work night shifts, subject to submitting a medical certificate.\nPregnant workers may undergo antenatal medical examinations during working hours without loss of pay.\nThe directive provides for 14 weeks’ maternity leave of which 2 weeks must occur before the birth.\nWomen must not be dismissed from work because of their pregnancy and maternity.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2019/1243 gives the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts to make strictly technical amendments to Annex I, in order to take account of technical progress, changes in international regulations or specifications and new findings.\nAnnex I contains a non-exhaustive list of physical, biological and chemical agents and working conditions referred to in Article 4 of the directive (assessment and information).\nAnnex II contains a non-exhaustive list of agents and working conditions referred to in Article 6 of the directive (cases in which exposure is prohibited).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 24 November 1992 and had to become law in the Member States by 24 November 1994.\nBACKGROUND\nArticle 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union gives the EU the authority to adopt legislation in the field of safety and health at work, in order to support and complement the activities of Member States.\nDirective 92/85/EEC is one of several ‘daughter directives’ adopted under the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on the safety and health of workers at work (see summary).\nPrinciple 10 of the European Pillar of Social Rights states that workers have the right to a high level of protection of their health and safety at work.\nFor more information, see: Health and safety at work (European Commission)Directive 92/85/EEC — pregnant workers (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPregnant worker: a pregnant woman who informs her employer of her condition, in accordance with national legislation and/or national practice.\nWorker who has recently given birth: a woman who has recently given birth as defined in national legislation and/or national practice and who informs her employer of her condition, in accordance with that legislation and/or practice.\nWorker who is breastfeeding: a woman who is breastfeeding as defined in national legislation and/or national practice and who informs her employer of her condition, in accordance with that legislation and/or practice.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (tenth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (OJ L 348, 28.11.1992, pp. 1-7)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 92/85/EEC have been incorporated into the original text.
