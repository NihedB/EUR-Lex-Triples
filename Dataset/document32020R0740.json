{"celex_id": "32020R0740", "reference": "5.6.2020\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 177/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2020/740 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 25 May 2020\non the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other parameters, amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article 194(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Union is committed to building an Energy Union with a forward‐looking climate policy. Fuel efficiency is a crucial element of the Union’s 2030 climate and energy policy framework and is key to moderating energy demand.\n(2)\nThe Commission has reviewed Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and has identified the need to update its provisions to improve its effectiveness.\n(3)\nIt is appropriate to replace Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 in order to clarify and update some of its provisions, taking into account technological progress with regard to tyres.\n(4)\nThe transport sector accounts for a third of the Union’s energy consumption. Road transport was responsible for about 22 % of the Union’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2015. Tyres, mainly because of their rolling resistance, account for 20 to 30 % of the fuel consumption of vehicles. A reduction in the rolling resistance of tyres would therefore contribute significantly to the fuel efficiency of road transport and thus to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to the decarbonisation of the transport sector.\n(5)\nIn order to meet the challenge of reducing the CO2 emissions of road transport, it is appropriate that Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, provide for incentives to innovate with regard to fuel‐efficient and safe C1 tyres, C2 tyres and C3 tyres.\n(6)\nTyres are characterised by a number of interrelated parameters. Improving one parameter, such as rolling resistance, may have an adverse impact on other parameters, such as wet grip, while improving wet grip performance may have an adverse impact on external rolling noise. Tyre manufacturers should be encouraged to optimise all parameters beyond the current standards.\n(7)\nFuel‐efficient tyres can be cost‐effective, since the fuel savings that they generate more than offset the increased purchase price resulting from the higher production costs of such tyres.\n(8)\nRegulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) lays down minimum requirements for the rolling resistance of tyres. Technological developments make it possible to reduce the energy losses that are due to tyre rolling resistance significantly beyond those minimum requirements. To reduce the environmental impact of road transport, it is therefore appropriate to update the provisions on the labelling of tyres to encourage end-users to purchase more fuel‐efficient tyres by providing them with harmonised information on the rolling resistance parameter.\n(9)\nImproving the labelling of tyres will enable consumers to obtain more relevant and more comparable information on fuel efficiency, safety and noise and to take cost‐effective and environmentally friendly decisions when purchasing tyres.\n(10)\nTraffic noise is a significant nuisance and has a harmful effect on health. Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 lays down minimum requirements for the external rolling noise of tyres. Technological developments make it possible to reduce external rolling noise significantly beyond those minimum requirements. To reduce traffic noise, it is therefore appropriate to update the provisions on the labelling of tyres to encourage end-users to purchase tyres with lower external rolling noise by providing them with harmonised information on the external rolling noise parameter.\n(11)\nThe provision of harmonised information on external rolling noise also facilitates the implementation of measures to limit traffic noise and contributes to increased awareness of the effect of tyres on traffic noise within the framework of Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).\n(12)\nRegulation (EC) No 661/2009 also lays down minimum requirements for the wet grip of tyres. Technological developments make it possible to improve wet grip significantly beyond those minimum requirements, and thus to reduce wet braking distances. To improve road safety, it is therefore appropriate to update the provisions on the labelling of tyres to encourage end-users to purchase tyres with higher wet grip performance by providing them with harmonised information on the wet grip parameter.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure alignment with the international framework, Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 refers to Regulation No 117 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UNECE) (6), which sets out the relevant measurement methods for the rolling resistance, external rolling noise, and wet and snow grip performance of tyres.\n(14)\nInformation on the performance of tyres that are specifically designed for use in severe snow and ice conditions should be included on the tyre label. Information on snow grip performance should be based on Regulation No 117 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UNECE), in its most up‐to‐date version applicable to the Union, (UNECE Regulation No 117), and the ‘Alpine Symbol’ pictogram contained therein should be included on the tyre label of a tyre which satisfies the minimum snow grip index values set out in that Regulation. Information on ice grip performance should, once the standard is formally adopted, be based on ISO standard ISO 19447 and the ice grip pictogram should be included on the tyre label of a tyre which satisfies the minimum ice grip index values set out in that ISO standard. Until adoption of ISO standard ISO 19447, ice grip performance should be assessed against reliable, accurate and reproducible methods, which take into account the generally recognised state of the art. The tyre label of a tyre which satisfies the minimum ice grip performance standards should show the ice grip pictogram set out in Annex I.\n(15)\nThe abrasion of tyres during use is a significant source of microplastics, which are harmful to the environment and human health. The Commission’s Communication ‘A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy’ therefore mentions the need to address the unintentional release of microplastics from tyres, inter alia through information measures such as labelling and through minimum requirements for tyres. Linked to tyre abrasion is the concept of mileage, namely the number of kilometres a tyre will last before it needs to be replaced because of tread wear. In addition to tyre abrasion and tread wear, the lifespan of a tyre depends on a range of factors, such as the wear resistance of the tyre, including the compound, tread pattern and structure, road conditions, maintenance, tyre pressure and driving behaviour.\n(16)\nHowever, a suitable testing method to measure tyre abrasion and mileage is not currently available. Therefore, the Commission should mandate the development of such a testing method, taking into full consideration the state of the art and internationally developed or proposed standards and regulations, as well as the work carried out by industry.\n(17)\nRe‐treaded tyres constitute a substantial part of the market for heavy‐duty vehicle tyres. The re‐treading of tyres extends their lifespan and contributes to circular economy objectives, such as waste reduction. Applying labelling requirements to such tyres would bring substantial energy savings. This Regulation should provide for the future inclusion of a suitable testing method to measure the performance of re‐treaded tyres, which is not currently available.\n(18)\nThe energy label provided for under Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), which ranks the energy consumption of products on a scale from ‘A’ to ‘G’, is recognised by over 85 % of Union consumers as a clear and transparent information tool and has proven to be effective in promoting more efficient products. The tyre label should be of the same design to the extent possible, while recognising the specificities of tyre parameters.\n(19)\nThe provision of comparable information on tyre parameters in the form of a standard tyre label is likely to influence purchasing decisions by end-users in favour of more fuel‐efficient, longer‐lasting, safer and quieter tyres. This, in turn, is likely to encourage tyre manufacturers to optimise tyre parameters, which would pave the way for a more sustainable consumption and production of tyres.\n(20)\nThe need for greater information on fuel efficiency and other parameters is relevant for all end-users, including purchasers of replacement tyres, purchasers of tyres fitted on new vehicles, and fleet managers and transport undertakings, who cannot easily compare the parameters of different tyre brands in the absence of a labelling and harmonised testing regime. It is therefore appropriate to require that a tyre label be provided for all tyres offered with or fitted on vehicles.\n(21)\nCurrently, tyre labels are required for tyres for cars (C1 tyres) and vans (C2 tyres) but not for heavy‐duty vehicles (C3 tyres). C3 tyres consume more fuel and cover more kilometres per year than C1 tyres or C2 tyres, and therefore the potential to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from heavy‐duty vehicles is significant. Therefore, C3 tyres should be included in the scope of this Regulation. Including C3 tyres fully in the scope of this Regulation is also in line with Regulation (EU) 2018/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), which provides for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from and fuel consumption of new heavy‐duty vehicles, and with Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), which sets CO2 emission performance standards for new heavy‐duty vehicles.\n(22)\nMany end-users make tyre purchasing decisions without seeing the actual tyre and therefore do not see the tyre label affixed to it. In such situations, end-users should be shown the tyre label before taking their purchasing decisions. The display of a tyre label on tyres at the point of sale, as well as in technical promotional material, should ensure that distributors as well as potential end-users receive harmonised information on the relevant tyre parameters at the time and place of the purchasing decision.\n(23)\nSome end-users make tyre purchasing decisions before arriving at the point of sale, or purchase tyres by mail order or on the internet. To ensure that those end-users can also make an informed choice on the basis of harmonised information on, inter alia, fuel efficiency, wet grip and external rolling noise, tyre labels should be displayed in all technical promotional material and visual advertisements for specific tyre types, including where such material is made available on the internet. Where visual advertisements pertain to a tyre family, and not only to a specific tyre type, the tyre label does not have to be shown.\n(24)\nPotential end-users should be provided with information explaining each component of the tyre label and its relevance. That information should be provided in all technical promotional material, for example on suppliers’ websites, but should not be required in visual advertisements. Technical promotional material should not be understood to include advertisements via billboards, newspapers, magazines or radio or television broadcasts.\n(25)\nWithout prejudice to the market surveillance obligations of Member States or to the obligation of suppliers to check product conformity, suppliers should make the requisite product compliance information electronically available in the product database. The information that is relevant to consumers and distributors should be made publicly available in the public part of the product database. That information should be made available as open data so as to give mobile application developers and comparison tools the opportunity to use it. Easy direct access to the public part of the product database should be facilitated by user‐oriented tools that are included on the printed tyre label, such as a dynamic quick response code (QR code).\n(26)\nThe compliance part of the product database should be subject to strict data protection rules. The required specific parts of the technical documentation in the compliance part of the product database should be made available both to market surveillance authorities and to the Commission. Where technical information is too sensitive to include it in the category of technical documentation, market surveillance authorities should have access to that information when necessary in accordance with the duty of cooperation on suppliers or by way of additional parts of the technical documentation uploaded to the product database by suppliers on a voluntary basis.\n(27)\nThe sale of tyres through internet sales platforms, rather than directly from suppliers, is growing. Therefore, hosting service providers should enable the display of the tyre label and product information sheet provided by the supplier close to the price indication. They should inform the distributor of the obligation to display the tyre label and product information sheet, but should not be responsible for the accuracy or content of that tyre label or product information sheet. The obligations imposed on hosting service providers under this Regulation should remain limited to what is reasonable and should not amount to a general obligation to monitor the information that they store or to actively seek facts or circumstances indicating activities that do not comply with the requirements of this Regulation. However, Article 14(1) of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) requires hosting service providers that wish to benefit from the liability exemption contained in that provision to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to information that they store at the request of recipients of their services where such information does not comply with the requirements of this Regulation, such as those relating to missing, incomplete or incorrect tyre labels or product information sheets. They should do so as soon as they obtain actual knowledge of such information or, as regards claims for damages, as soon as they become aware of such information, for example through specific information provided by a market surveillance authority. Suppliers selling directly to end-users via their own website are subject to the same distance selling obligations as distributors.\n(28)\nRolling resistance, wet grip, external rolling noise and other parameters should be measured in accordance with reliable, accurate and reproducible methods that take into account the generally recognised state‐of‐the‐art measurement and calculation methods. As far as possible, such methods should reflect average consumer behaviour and be robust in order to deter both intentional and unintentional circumvention. Tyre labels should reflect the comparative performance of the tyres in actual use, within the constraints arising from the need for reliable, accurate and reproducible laboratory testing, in order to enable end-users to compare different tyres and to limit testing costs for manufacturers.\n(29)\nWhere they have sufficient reason to believe that a supplier has not ensured the accuracy of the tyre label and in order to give additional confidence to consumers, national authorities as defined in point (37) of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) should check whether the classes for rolling resistance, wet grip and external rolling noise displayed on the tyre label, as well as the pictograms for other parameters, correspond to the documentation provided by the supplier based on test results and calculations. Such checks may take place during the type‐approval process and do not necessarily require the physical testing of the tyre.\n(30)\nCompliance by suppliers, wholesalers, dealers and other distributors with the provisions on the labelling of tyres is essential in order to ensure a level playing field in the Union. Member States should therefore monitor such compliance through regular ex‐post controls and market surveillance in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(31)\nIn order to facilitate the monitoring of compliance, to provide a useful tool to end-users and to allow alternative ways for distributors to receive product information sheets, tyres should be included in the product database established under Regulation (EU) 2017/1369. That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(32)\nIn order for end-users to have confidence in the tyre label, other labels that mimic the tyre label should not be allowed. For the same reason, other labels, marks, symbols or inscriptions that are likely to mislead or confuse end-users with respect to the parameters covered by the tyre label should not be allowed.\n(33)\nThe penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted pursuant thereto should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(34)\nIn order to promote energy efficiency, climate change mitigation, road safety and environmental protection, Member States should be able to create incentives for the use of energy‐efficient and safe tyres. Member States are free to decide on the nature of such incentives. Such incentives should comply with Union State aid rules and should not constitute unjustifiable market barriers. This Regulation does not prejudice the outcome of any State aid procedures that may be undertaken in accordance with Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in respect of such incentives.\n(35)\nIn order to amend the content and format of the tyre label, to introduce requirements with respect to re‐treaded tyres, tyre abrasion and mileage, and to adapt the Annexes to technological progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law‐Making (13). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(36)\nOnce reliable, accurate and reproducible methods to test and measure tyre abrasion and mileage are available, the Commission should assess the feasibility of adding information on tyre abrasion and mileage to the tyre label. When proposing a delegated act to add tyre abrasion and mileage to the tyre label, the Commission should take that assessment into account, and should collaborate closely with industry, relevant standardisation organisations, such as the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) or the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), and representatives of other stakeholders interested in the development of suitable testing methods. Information on tyre abrasion and mileage should be unambiguous and should not negatively affect the clear intelligibility and effectiveness of the tyre label as a whole towards end-users. Such information would also enable end-users to make an informed choice with regard to tyres, their lifespan and the unintentional release of microplastics. This would help protect the environment and at the same time allow end-users to estimate the operating costs of tyres over a longer period.\n(37)\nTyres which were already placed on the market before the date of application of this Regulation should not need to be provided with a new tyre label.\n(38)\nThe size of the tyre label should remain the same as that set out in Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009. Details regarding snow grip and ice grip, and the QR code, should be included on the tyre label.\n(39)\nThe Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation. In accordance with paragraph 22 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law‐Making, that evaluation should be based on efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and value added and should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action.\n(40)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to increase safety, the protection of health, and the economic and environmental efficiency of road transport by providing information to end-users to allow them to choose more fuel‐efficient, longer‐lasting, safer and quieter tyres, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because it requires harmonised information for end-users, but can rather, by reason of the need for a harmonised regulatory framework and a level playing field for manufacturers, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). A Regulation remains the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which preclude divergent transposition by Member States and thus ensures a higher degree of harmonisation across the Union. A harmonised regulatory framework at Union rather than at Member State level reduces costs for suppliers, ensures a level playing field and ensures the free movement of goods across the internal market. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 TEU, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(41)\nRegulation (EC) No 1222/2009 should therefore be repealed with effect from the date of the application of this Regulation,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a framework for the provision of harmonised information on tyre parameters through labelling to allow end-users to make an informed choice when purchasing tyres, for the purpose of increasing safety, the protection of health, and the economic and environmental efficiency of road transport, by promoting fuel‐efficient, long‐lasting and safe tyres with low noise levels.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Definitions\nFor the purposes of the laboratory alignment procedure for the measurement of rolling resistance, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘reference laboratory’ means a laboratory that is part of the network of laboratories, the names of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union for the purpose of the laboratory alignment procedure, and that is able to achieve the accuracy of test results determined in Section 3 with its reference machine;\n(2)\n‘candidate laboratory’ means a laboratory participating in the laboratory alignment procedure that is not a reference laboratory;\n(3)\n‘alignment tyre’ means a tyre that is tested for the purpose of performing the laboratory alignment procedure;\n(4)\n‘alignment tyre set’ means a set of five or more alignment tyres for the alignment of one single machine;\n(5)\n‘assigned value’ means a theoretical value of the rolling resistance coefficient (RRC) of one alignment tyre as measured by a theoretical laboratory which is representative of the network of reference laboratories that is used for the laboratory alignment procedure;\n(6)\n‘machine’ means every tyre testing spindle in one specific measurement method; for example, two spindles acting on the same drum shall not be considered as one machine.\n2.   General provisions\n2.1.   Principle\nThe measured (m) rolling resistance coefficient obtained in a reference laboratory (l), (RRCm,l\n), shall be aligned to the assigned values of the network of reference laboratories.\nThe measured (m) rolling resistance coefficient obtained by a machine in a candidate laboratory (c), (RRCm,c\n), shall be aligned through one reference laboratory of the network of its choice.\n2.2.

Measurement method\nThe reference laboratory shall measure each alignment tyre four times and retain the three last results for further analysis, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117 and under the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117.\nThe candidate laboratory shall measure each alignment tyre (n + 1) times, with n being specified in Section 5 of this Annex and retain the n last results for further analysis, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117 and applying the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117.\nEach time an alignment tyre is measured, the tyre/wheel assembly shall be removed from the machine and the entire test procedure referred to in paragraph 4 of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117 shall be followed again from the start.\nThe candidate or reference laboratory shall calculate:\n(a)\nthe measured value of each alignment tyre for each measurement as specified in paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117 (i.e. corrected for a temperature of 25 °C and a drum diameter of 2 m);\n(b)\nthe mean value of the three last measured values of each alignment tyre (in the case of reference laboratories) or the mean value of the n last measured values of each alignment tyre (in the case of candidate laboratories); and\n(c)\nthe standard deviation (σm\n) as follows:\nwhere:\ni\nis the counter from 1 to p for the alignment tyres;\nj\nis the counter from 2 to n + 1 for the n last repetitions of each measurement of a given alignment tyre;\nn + 1\nis the number of repetitions of tyre measurements (n + 1 = 4 for reference laboratories and n + 1 ≥ 4 for candidate laboratories);\np\nis the number of alignment tyres (p ≥ 5).\n2.4.   Data formats to be used for the computations and results\nThe measured RRC values corrected from drum diameter and temperature shall be rounded to two decimal places.\nThen the computations shall be made with all digits: there shall be no further rounding except on the final alignment equations.\nAll standard deviation values shall be displayed to three decimal places.\nAll RRC values will be displayed to two decimal places.\nAll alignment coefficients (A1\nl\n, B1\nl\n, A2\nc\n and B2\nc\n) shall be rounded and displayed to four decimal places.\n3.   Requirements applicable to the reference laboratories and determination of the assigned values\nThe assigned values of each alignment tyre shall be determined by a network of reference laboratories. Every second year the network shall assess the stability and validity of the assigned values.\nEach reference laboratory participating in the network shall comply with the specifications of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117 and have a standard deviation (σm\n) as follows:\n(a)\nnot greater than 0,05 N/kN for C1 tyres and C2 tyres; and\n(b)\nnot greater than 0,05 N/kN for C3 tyres.\nThe alignment tyre sets that have been selected in accordance with Section 2.2 shall be measured in accordance with Section 2.3 by each reference laboratory of the network.\nThe assigned value of each alignment tyre is the average of the measured values given by the reference laboratories of the network for this alignment tyre.\n4.   Procedure for the alignment of a reference laboratory to the assigned values\nEach reference laboratory (l) shall align itself to each new set of assigned values and always after any significant machine change or any drift in machine control tyre monitoring data.\nThe alignment shall use a linear regression technique on all individual data. The regression coefficients, A1\nl\n and B1\nl\n, shall be calculated as follows:\nRRC = A1\nl\n × RRCm,l\n + B1\nl\nwhere:\nRRC\nl\nis the assigned value of the rolling resistance coefficient;\nRRCm,\nl\nis the individual measured value of the rolling resistance coefficient by the reference laboratory ‘l’ (including temperature and drum diameter corrections).\n5.   Requirements applicable to candidate laboratories\nCandidate laboratories shall repeat the alignment procedure at least once every second year for every machine and always after any significant machine change or any drift in machine control tyre monitoring data.\nA common set of five different tyres that have been selected in accordance with Section 2.2 shall be measured in accordance with Section 2.3 first by the candidate laboratory and then by one reference laboratory. More than five alignment tyres may be tested at the request of the candidate laboratory.\nThe candidate laboratory shall provide the alignment tyre set to the selected reference laboratory.\nThe candidate laboratory (c) shall comply with the specifications of Annex 6 to UNECE Regulation No 117 and preferably have standard deviations (σm\n) as follows:\n(a)\nnot greater than 0,075 N/kN for C1 tyres and C2 tyres; and\n(b)\nnot greater than 0,06 N/kN for C3 tyres.\nIf the standard deviation (σm\n) of the candidate laboratory is higher than those values after four measurements, the last three being used for the computations, then the number n + 1 of measurement repetitions shall be increased as follows for the entire batch:\nn + 1 = 1 + (σm\n/γ)2, rounded up to the nearest higher integer value\nwhere:\nγ = 0,043 N/kN for C1 tyres and C2 tyres;\nγ = 0,035 N/kN for C3 tyres.\n6.   Procedure for the alignment of a candidate laboratory\nOne reference laboratory (l) of the network shall calculate the linear regression function on all individual data of the candidate laboratory (c). The regression coefficients, A2\nc\n and B2\nc\n, shall be calculated as follows:\nRRCm,l = A2\nc × RRCm,c\n + B2\nc\nwhere:\nRRCm,l\nis the individual measured value of the rolling resistance coefficient by the reference laboratory (l) (including temperature and drum diameter corrections);\nRRCm,c\nis the individual measured value of the rolling resistance coefficient by the candidate laboratory (c) (including temperature and drum diameter corrections)\nIf the coefficient of determination R2\n is lower than 0,97, the candidate laboratory shall not be aligned.\nThe aligned RRC of tyres tested by the candidate laboratory shall be calculated as follows:\nRRC = (A1\nl × A2\nc\n) × RRCm,c\n + (A1\nl\n × B2\nc\n + B1\nl\n)\nANNEX VI\nVERIFICATION PROCEDURE\nThe conformity with this Regulation of the declared fuel efficiency, wet grip and external rolling noise classes, as well as the declared values, and any additional performance information on the tyre label, shall be assessed for each tyre type or each grouping of tyres as determined by the supplier, according to one of the following procedures:\n1.\nA single tyre or tyre set is tested first. If the measured values meet the declared classes or the declared external rolling noise value within the verification tolerances referred to in the table below, the tyre label shall be considered to comply with this Regulation.\nIf the measured values do not meet the declared classes or the declared external rolling noise value within the verification tolerances referred to in the table below, three additional tyres or tyre sets are to be tested;

It makes labels about a tyre’s characteristics and performance, in snow and ice for instance, more visible and informative. This will help end-users* take into account features such as safety, health protection and economic and environmental efficiency.\nThe legislation is designed to promote fuel-efficient, long-lasting and safe tyres with low noise levels.\nIt amends Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 (see summary).\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation:\napplies to tyres for passenger cars (C1 tyres), buses and coaches, light and heavy goods vehicles, and light and heavy trailers (C2 and C3 tyres), as well as to retreads* once a suitable performance test is available;\ndoes not apply to certain specalised categories of tyre, such as those for off-road professional use, to vehicles first registered before 1 October 1990 or to second-hand tyres, unless imported from a non-EU country.\nTyre suppliers must:\nattach a sticker label to individual tyres and a printed label to a batch of tyres, containing the information set out in Annexes I and II, and provide a product information sheet containing the details specified in Annex III;\nmake the tyre label visible, preferably close to the price, in advertisements and distance selling or internet sales;\nensure the tyre labels and product information sheets are accurate;\ncooperate with market surveillance authorities, which may carry out routine and ad hoc inspections, and act immediately if any infringements are discovered;\nprovide their national authorities, via a product database, with technical details of the tyres and their performance before they are offered for sale, enabling authorities to check the accuracy of the tyre labels — the information will have to be supplied from 1 May 2021 (and by 30 November 2021 for tyres produced between 25 June 2020 and 30 April 2021);\nnot provide or display labels, marks, symbols or inscriptions that do not comply with the regulation.\nTyre distributors must:\nattach a sticker label to individual tyres and a printed label to a batch of tyres at the point of sale, containing the information required;\nensure the tyre label is displayed close to the price on any technical promotional material, paper-based distances sales, and advertisements and internet sales;\nprovide customers with a copy of the tyre label before a sale, if the tyres are not visible;\ninform customers where they can access the product information sheet.\nSuppliers and distributors of new vehicles must provide customers with the tyre label, product information sheet and any relevant technical promotional material before a purchase is made.\nInternet service providers must ensure that suppliers selling tyres on their sites display the necessary label as well as the information sheet.\nNational authorities must:\nallow the sale and use of tyres that comply with the legislation;\nverify the accuracy of the information on the tyre labels;\nlay down penalty and enforcement rules for any infringements.\nThe European Commission:\nencourages and supports cooperation and information exchange between market surveillance authorities;\nmay adopt delegated acts to amend some of the annexes to take account of technical improvements;\nsubmits a report evaluating the regulation to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee by 1 June 2025.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) 2020/740 repeals the tyre-labelling Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 (see summary).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 1 May 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe tyre-labelling system aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution and improve road safety. Tyres account for 20-30% of a vehicle’s fuel consumption. Reducing their rolling resistance helps cut emissions and increase savings for drivers through lower fuel consumption.\nFor more information, see:\nTyres — Energy label (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nEnd-user: an individual consumer, fleet manager or road transport company.\nRetread: a reconditioned tyre where the worn tread is replaced with new material.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2020/740 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 2020 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other parameters, amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 (OJ L 177, 5.6.2020, pp. 1-31)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2020/740 have been incorporated into the original text.
