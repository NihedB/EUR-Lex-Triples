(ITTO).\nThe EU pays the highest contribution to the ITTO and has the most votes within the International Tropical Timber Council, the highest authority of the ITTO.\nA decision to extend the ITTA for another 5 years was reached during the 57th session of the International Tropical Timber Council from 29 November to 3 December 2021: the members of the International Tropical Timber Council agreed that, in the next 5 years, an assessment of the relevance and added value of the ITTA in the global context would be carried out to help decide whether to renegotiate or further extend the agreement;this decision should be taken 2 years before the end of the latest extension.\nObjectives\nThe agreement has a number of specific objectives, including:\nto provide an effective basis for consultation, international cooperation and policy development regarding the world timber economy;\nto establish a consultation forum to promote non-discriminatory timber practices;\nto enhance members’ capacity to export tropical timber and timber products from sustainably managed sources;\nto improve understanding of long-term trends in the tropical timber market;\nto improve forest management and wood utilisation research;\nto encourage tropical timber reforestation and restoration of degraded forest land, taking the needs of local communities into account;\nto encourage the development of national policies that aim to conserve timber-producing forests and that maintain an ecological balance;\nto strengthen forest law enforcement and governance; and\nto address the problem of illegal logging of tropical timber.\nContributions\nCompulsory contributions by the consumer members of the ITTO are assessed primarily by the volume of imported timber.\nThe EU contributes to the administrative account of the ITTO; the EU and its Member States can make voluntary financial contributions to planned actions.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered
