The grants should contribute towards making the selected national authorities self-sustaining entities in subsequent years.\nIn order to receive such grants, the recipient national authorities will need to provide the OPCW with quantifiable objectives to be accomplished as well as a clear time-frame for their implementation with the use of the grants. As part of the contract, the recipient national authority will be obliged to report its activities to the Technical Secretariat on a regular basis. The disbursement of grants will be made in instalments, with successive instalments being released after review of progress achieved. The Technical Secretariat will provide the EU with relevant details of progress by recipient States Parties as well as a financial statement on the use of the funds by each recipient State Party.\nTotal Estimated Cost: EUR 100 000\n2.2.3.   Participation of national authorities and customs authorities in one or more technical meetings in The Hague or elsewhere, on the transfer provisions of the CWC\nProject description\nThe difficulties met by States Parties in collecting reliable import-export data for scheduled chemicals and making accurate declarations to the OPCW and in monitoring the trade in scheduled chemicals due to national capacity restraints have an impact on the effectiveness of the verification regime of the OPCW and the attainment of its non-proliferation objectives.\nThe Technical Secretariat is seeking to address the above challenges by focusing on the following:\n—\nmaking stakeholders in national authorities, especially customs authorities, aware of the CWC legal requirements in order to further the non-proliferation objectives of the Convention,\n—\nproviding customs authorities with technical information through focused meetings on better management of import-export procedures for the regulation of trade in scheduled chemicals,\n—\nidentifying relevant chemicals for effective monitoring of trade in scheduled chemicals and sharing of national and regional experiences in implementing the transfer provisions of the Convention,\n—\ndisseminating information on EU initiatives and assistance activities for the monitoring of scheduled chemicals,\n—\nunderstanding the practical difficulties and challenges that customs authorities in different regions and sub-regions encounter in monitoring the trade in scheduled chemicals,\n—\nfacilitating better understanding and cooperation amongst stake holders of the national authorities for monitoring and submitting data on the import-export of scheduled chemicals,\n—\nseeking synergies between the different international regimes which customs authorities are required to monitor and providing of a forum for consultation and cooperation within sub-regions to implement the requirements of the CWC effectively.\nThe Technical Secretariat will organise three sub-regional meetings for South East Asia, the Southern African Development Community and for States Parties in Eastern Europe. Through these meetings, the Technical Secretariat will seek to highlight the need for all States Parties to put in place measures that will help attain the non-proliferation objectives of the CWC. In addition, during the Annual Regional Meeting of national authorities in GRULAC, there will be a focus on the need for effective interaction between national authorities and customs authorities.\nThe number of States Parties attending a sub-regional event ranges between seven and ten. Two representatives from the national authority and customs authorities from each State Party are invited to participate. Resource persons with a relevant specialisation are also sponsored by the OPCW for such meetings.\nTotal estimated cost: EUR 183 466\n2.2.4.   Outreach to make Parliamentarians aware of the CWC requirements for States Parties to adopt comprehensive national implementing legislation\nProject purpose\nPromote the adoption of national implementing legislation in States Parties.\nProject description\nThe Technical Secretariat will seek to reach out to parliaments in the different geographical regions represented in the OPCW with the purpose of making them aware of the importance of adopting CWC national implementing legislation.\nTo that end, the Technical Secretariat will seek to organise two dedicated meetings of Parliamentarians at regional level in Asia and Latin America.\nIn addition, awareness-raising work will continue to be carried out during the Assemblies of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\nThis request is made on the basis of the number of drafts of national implementing legislation expected to be considered by national Parliaments during 2007-2008. Only a third of the OPCW members have comprehensive national implementing legislation.\nTotal estimated cost: EUR 167 769\nTotal estimated cost of Project 2: EUR 676 733\n2.3.   Project 3: International cooperation in the field of chemical activities\nAnalytical skills development course\nProject purpose\nTo facilitate the development of the States Parties' capacities to implement the CWC in the field of chemical activities in accordance with the provisions of Article XI of the CWC.\nThis project essentially focuses on the building of capacities through the provision of support to analytical laboratories by way of training in the area of sampling and analysis of chemicals relevant to the CWC.\nProject results/activities\n—\nAssisting qualified analytical chemists from States Parties to acquire further experience and practical knowledge to facilitate the analysis of chemicals related to the national implementation of the CWC,\n—\nenabling analytical laboratories in these targeted countries to upgrade their levels of technical competence.\nProject description\nThree units of the analytical development course will be organised for 20 participants each in 2007.

Project 4: Assistance and protection against chemical weapons\nProject purpose\nThe OPCW is committed to addressing threats to peace and security. These threats call for rapid and coordinated responses at national, regional and international levels. Article X of the CWC which consists of assistance and protection has a particular role in this regard. The OPCW is required to develop and maintain a state of readiness to provide a timely, adequate and efficient response. For this reason, the OPCW needs to assist States Parties to develop and/or improve national and regional response systems against chemical weapons and to build an effective mechanism for the mobilisation of international assistance to any requesting State Party in the case of possible use of chemical weapons.\nProject results\n—\nStrengthening of the capabilities of the Technical Secretariat to mobilise and coordinate international assistance,\n—\nbuilding/developing or improving the national response capabilities and protection programmes of States Parties,\n—\nestablishment of effectively functioning regional protection networks,\n—\nprovision and dissemination of information in the field of protection against chemical weapons.\n2.4.1.   Technical visits to States Parties for inspection of offers of assistance\nProject description\nThe Technical Secretariat will carry out up to six visits in 2007 to States Parties for inspection of offers of assistance under paragraph 7 of Article X of the CWC. The Technical Secretariat team will be composed of a maximum of two experts.\nA total of 71 States Parties have undertaken to provide assistance through the OPCW, and to this end 42 States Parties elected to volunteer assistance to the OPCW, in this regard. These voluntary assistance pledges include different types of individual protective equipment, detection and decontamination equipment and units, humanitarian equipment, literature, and expert advice.\nThese visits will allow offers made by the visited OPCW Member State to be assessed in order to ensure their validity, and verify the status of the equipment (shelf-life, packing, availability, readiness to be delivered, etc.). If the equipment is at the limits of its shelf-life or if the offer is intended to be changed, such visits will establish the new conditions and get more details about the offer. This information will be entered into the OPCW Assistance and Protection database.\nTotal estimated cost: EUR 45 230\n2.4.2.   National capacity building of North African States Parties against chemical weapons\nProject description\nIn the current security situation, the States Parties are becoming more aware of the fact that their current national response plans do not take into account the possible use of WMD. Consequently, the OPCW is receiving high numbers of requests related to protective capacity building against chemical weapons from States Parties, in the event of a chemical terrorist attack.\nThe Technical Secretariat has given high priority to the African region, where almost no protective capacity exists against chemical weapons, and the Technical Secretariat believes the need is greatest and has decided to provide this region with timely assistance.\nRecently, for the sake of the security and safety of the region, the North African States Parties (Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia), asked the OPCW for assistance in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article X of the CWC, which entitles States Parties to request and receive expert advice from the Technical Secretariat in improving and developing their capacity building against chemical weapons.\nThe Technical Secretariat has planned a set of activities aimed at training first responders involved in the field, and developing their emergency response system against chemical warfare agents (CWA). The activity in North Africa will start with one preliminary planning meeting, followed by basic, advanced and specialised protection courses. The project will be concluded with a sub-regional exercise and a final evaluation meeting.\nTotal estimated cost: EUR 200 900\nTotal estimated cost of Project 4: EUR 246 130\n2.5.
