The dialogue between the two sides of industry at European level which is to be developed, may, if the parties deem it desirable, result in contractual relations in particular at inter-occupational and sectoral level;Whereas the Commission in response to the Communication of 18 September 1996 concerning the development of the social dialogue at Community level (1) received a strong support from all involved parties in its suggestion to strengthen the sectoral social dialogue;Whereas the European Parliament, in its Resolution of 18 July 1997 (2), responding to that Commission Communication, called for a specific importance to be attached to the sectoral social dialogue since the impact of regulation and/or deregulation on employment in the economic sectors can best be assessed within the sectoral dialogue;Whereas the Economic and Social Committee in its opinion of 29 January 1997 (3), responding to that Commission Communication, stated that the sectoral dialogue must be effective, efficient and well-directed;Whereas the situation in the various Member States clearly demonstrates the need for the two sides of industry to participate actively in discussions on the improvement of living and working conditions in their sector; whereas a sectoral dialogue committee attached to the Commission is the most appropriate means of ensuring such participation, by creating at Community level a representative forum for the socio-economic interests involved;Whereas the Commission should endeavour to ensure that the membership and the activities of the Sectoral Dialogue Committees contribute to the promotion of equality between women and men;Whereas the existing Joint Committees should be replaced by the Sectoral Dialogue Committees; whereas the Decisions establishing those Committees should therefore be repealed,HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:Article 1 Sectoral Dialogue Committees (hereinafter referred to as 'the Committees`) are hereby established in those sectors where the social partners make a joint request to take part in a dialogue at European level, and where the organisations representing both sides of industry fulfil the following criteria:(a) they shall relate to specific sectors or categories and be organised at European level;(b) they shall consist of organisations which are themselves an integral and recognized part of Member States' social partner structures and have the capacity to negotiate agreements, and which are representative of several Member States;(c) they shall have adequate structures to ensure their effective participation in the work of the Committees.Article 2 Each Committee shall, for the sector of activity for which it is established,(a) be consulted on developments at Community level having social implications, and(b) develop and promote the social dialogue at sectoral level.Article 3 The representatives of the two sides of industry taking part in the meetings of each Committee shall number a maximum of 40 in all, with an equal number of representatives of the employers' and workers' delegations.Article 4 The Commission shall invite the representatives to participate in the meetings of the Committees on a proposal from the social partner organisations which have made the request set out in Article 1.Article 5 1.

They are a feature of the wider European social dialogue* which is an essential element of the EU’s social model and governance.\nKEY POINTS\nThe sectoral dialogue committees are created in sectors where organisations representing workers and employers in this sector jointly indicate they wish to take part in a dialogue at EU level. They must:\nrelate to specific economic sectors, such as banking or agriculture;\nconsist of organisations which are recognised national social partners;\nhave the capacity to negotiate agreements; and\nrepresent social partners of several EU countries;\nhave the structure and resources to participate effectively in EU-level work.\nEach committee:\nis consulted on EU developments that have social implications in its area;\ndevelops and promotes the social dialogue within its remit;\nhas a maximum number of 66 members, with an equal number of employer and employee representatives;\nestablishes, together with the European Commission, its own rules of procedure;\nmeets at least once a year;\nis chaired either by an employer or employee representative or by a Commission official;\nreviews regularly with the Commission its activities.\nThe sectoral dialogue committees replace earlier forms of sectoral cooperation between social partners.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 20 May 1998.\nBACKGROUND\nArticle 152 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union confirms the EU’s commitment to support European social dialogue and recognises European social partners’ autonomy.\nSince 1998, the Commission has created over 40 sectoral social dialogue committees. They cover some 150 million workers in the EU in sectors such as different modes of transport, agriculture, construction, commerce, public services, construction of machinery and equipment, hotels and restaurants, and banking.\nThe dialogue has led to agreement on around 900 texts of varying legal status.\nFor more information, see Sectoral social dialogue on the European Commission’s website.\nKEY TERM\n* European social dialogue: discussions, consultations, negotiations and joint activities involving both sides of industry (employers and employees).\nACT\n            \nCommission Decision 98/500/EC of 20 May 1998 on the establishment of Sectoral Dialogue Committees promoting the Dialogue between the social partners at European level (OJ L 225, 12.8.1998, pp. 27-28)\nSuccessive amendments to Commission Decision 98/500/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
