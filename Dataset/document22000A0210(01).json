The aim is to remove technical barriers to trade in motor vehicles between countries signed up to the agreement.\nDecision 2000/125/EC gives the EU’s approval to a parallel agreement, finalised in June 1998. Its aim is to establish global technical regulations on the safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and anti-theft performance for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts.\nThe EU’s involvement in both agreements ensures consistency in their different harmonisation activities.\nKEY POINTS\nDecision 97/836/EC:\nlists the UN/ECE regulations (over 100) the EU will implement. These range from headlamps and brakes to seat belts and anti-theft devices;\nstates that the EU may withdraw from, or sign up to, a regulation as it wishes;\nsets out the practical arrangements for the EU’s involvement in the UN/ECE’s work, both on new regulations and priorities for the organisation’s work programme;\nconfirms that EU countries which sign up to UN regulations, to which the EU as a whole is not party, may apply them provided these are not incompatible with the EU legislation on type approval* for motor vehicles.\nThe UN/ECE 1958 agreement:\nestablishes an administrative committee with representatives from all signatory countries to prepare the technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts;\nlays down the administrative committee’s composition and rules of procedure: a quorum requires at least half of the member countries to be present;a two-thirds majority is needed to approve a new regulation or adopt an amendment;a regulation comes into force 6 months after being adopted, unless over one third of members disagree;\nstipulates that regulations cover: wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts;technical requirements;test methods for performance requirements;conditions for granting type approval;date of entry into force;\nsets out procedures to ensure vehicles and parts meet the required standards before receiving type approval;\nenables signatory countries to grant type approval for vehicles, equipment and parts satisfying the various regulations and confirms they must accept those issued by their partners;\nrequires any disputes between members to be settled by negotiation and, failing that, by arbitration.\nThe Parallel Agreement:\nestablishes an executive committee to implement the agreement;\nsets out the criteria technical regulations must meet;\nprovides 2 procedures, instead of mutual recognition of the type-approval system, to agree new global technical regulations: harmonising existing national regulations or standards contained in a compendium as candidates for global agreement;drafting new regulations which would be listed in a global registry;\nconfirms the European Commission represents the EU in: adopting and notifying global technical regulations;participating in resolving disputes;amending the agreement.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe EU became a contracting party to the 1958 agreement on 24 March 1998.\nThe parallel agreement of 1998 entered into force on 25 August 2000.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe 2 agreements contribute to the aims of the EU’s common commercial policy by eliminating technical barriers to trade and helping access to non-EU markets.\nFor more information, see:\nInternational technical harmonisation (European Commission)\nText of the 1958 Agreement (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe)\nWhat UNECE does for you (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe)\nWorld Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) — How It Works, How to Join It (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe)\nKEY TERMS\n              \nWheeled vehicle: a vehicle that moves on wheels and usually has a container to transport people or things.\nType approval: the process applied by national authorities to certify that a model of a vehicle meets all EU safety, environmental and conformity of production requirements before authorising it to be placed on the EU market.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 97/836/EC of 27 November 1997 with a view to accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’) (OJ L 346, 17.12.1997, pp. 78-94)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 97/836/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
