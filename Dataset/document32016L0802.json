{"celex_id": "32016L0802", "reference": "21.5.2016\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 132/58\nDIRECTIVE (EU) 2016/802 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 May 2016\nrelating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels\n(codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 1999/32/EC (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Directive should be codified.\n(2)\nThe environmental policy of the Union, as set out in the action programmes on the environment, and in particular in the Sixth Environment Action Programme adopted by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), and in the Seventh Environment Action Programme adopted by Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, (6) has as one of its objectives to achieve levels of air quality that do not give rise to significant negative impacts on, and risks to, human health and the environment.\n(3)\nArticle 191(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that Union policy on the environment is to aim at a high level of protection, taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union.\n(4)\nThis Directive lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the Union.\n(5)\nEmissions from shipping due to the combustion of marine fuels with a high sulphur content contribute to air pollution in the form of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter, which harm human health and the environment and contribute to acid deposition. Without the measures set out in this Directive, emissions from shipping would soon have been higher than emissions from all land-based sources.\n(6)\nAcidification and atmospheric sulphur dioxide damage sensitive ecosystems, reduce biodiversity and amenity value and detrimentally affect crop production and the growth of forests. Acid rain falling in cities may cause significant damage to buildings and the architectural heritage. Sulphur dioxide pollution may also have a significant effect upon human health, particularly among those sectors of the population suffering from respiratory diseases.\n(7)\nAcidification is a transboundary phenomenon requiring Union as well as national or local solutions.\n(8)\nEmissions of sulphur dioxide contribute to the formation of particulate matter in the atmosphere.\n(9)\nAir pollution caused by ships at berth is a major concern for many harbour cities when it comes to their efforts to meet the Union's air quality limit values.\n(10)\nMember States should encourage the use of shore-side electricity, as the electricity for present-day ships is usually provided by auxiliary engines.\n(11)\nThe Union and the individual Member States are Contracting Parties to the UN-ECE Convention of 13 November 1979 on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The second UN-ECE Protocol on transboundary pollution by sulphur dioxide stipulates that the Contracting Parties should reduce sulphur dioxide emissions in line with or beyond the 30 % reduction specified in the first Protocol, and the second UN-ECE Protocol is based on the premise that critical loads and levels will continue to be exceeded in some sensitive areas. Further measures to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions will still be required. The Contracting Parties should therefore make further significant reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide.\n(12)\nSulphur, which is naturally present in small quantities in oil and coal, has for decades been recognised as the dominant source of sulphur dioxide emissions, which are one of the main causes of ‘acid rain’ and one of the major causes of the air pollution experienced in many urban and industrial areas.\n(13)\nStudies have shown that the benefits from reducing sulphur emissions by reductions in the sulphur content of fuels will often be considerably greater than the estimated costs to industry in this Directive. The technology exists and is well established for reducing the sulphur level of liquid fuels.\n(14)\nIn accordance with Article 193 TFEU, this Directive should not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures in order to encourage early implementation with respect to the maximum sulphur content of marine fuels, for instance using emission abatement methods outside SOx Emission Control Areas. Such measures are required to be compatible with the Treaties and are to be notified to the Commission.\n(15)\nA Member State, before introducing new, more stringent protective measures, should notify the draft measures to the Commission in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(16)\nThe TFEU requires consideration to be given to the special characteristics of the outermost regions of the Union, namely the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.\n(17)\nWith regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, it is appropriate to provide for derogations in Member States and regions where the environmental conditions so allow.\n(18)\nWith regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, it is also appropriate to provide for derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down in Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n(19)\nFor refinery combustion plants excluded from the scope of point (d) of Article 3(2) or point (c) of Article 3(3) of this Directive the emissions of sulphur dioxide averaged over such plants should not exceed the limits set out in Directive 2001/80/EC, or Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU, or any future revision of those Directives. In the application of this Directive, Member States should bear in mind that substitution by fuels other than those referred to in Article 2 should not produce an increase in emissions of acidifying pollutants.\n(20)\nIn 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL), containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010.\n(21)\nThe revised Annex VI to MARPOL introduces, inter alia, stricter sulphur limits for marine fuel in SOx Emission Control Areas (1,00 % as of 1 July 2010 and 0,10 % as of 1 January 2015) as well as in sea areas outside SOx Emission Control Areas (3,50 % as of 1 January 2012 and, in principle, 0,50 % as of 1 January 2020). Most Member States are obliged, in accordance with their international commitments, to require ships to use fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 1,00 % in SOx Emission Control Areas as of 1 July 2010. In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in the Union, this Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL. In order to ensure a minimum quality of fuel used by ships either for fuel-based or technology-based compliance, marine fuel the sulphur content of which exceeds the general standard of 3,50 % by mass should not be allowed for use in the Union, except for fuels supplied to ships using emission abatement methods operating in closed mode.\n(22)\nAmendments to Annex VI to MARPOL regarding SOx Emission Control Areas are possible under IMO procedures. In the event that further changes, including exemptions, are introduced with regard to the application of limits for SOx Emission Control Areas in Annex VI to MARPOL, the Commission should consider any such changes and, where appropriate, without delay make the necessary proposal in accordance with the TFEU to fully align this Directive with the IMO rules regarding SOx Emission Control Areas.\n(23)\nThe introduction of any new emission control areas should be subject to the IMO process under Annex VI to MARPOL and should be underpinned by a well-founded case based on environmental and economic grounds and supported by scientific data.\n(24)\nIn accordance with Regulation 18 of the revised Annex VI to MARPOL, Member States should endeavour to ensure the availability of marine fuels which comply with this Directive.\n(25)\nIn view of the global dimension of environmental politics and shipping emissions, ambitious emission standards should be set at a global level.\n(26)\nThe Union will continue to advocate more effective protection of areas sensitive to SOx emissions and a reduction in the normal limit value for bunker fuel oil at the IMO.\n(27)\nPassenger ships operate mostly in ports or close to coastal areas and their impacts on human health and the environment are significant. In order to improve air quality around ports and coasts, those ships are required to use marine fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 1,50 % until stricter sulphur standards apply to all ships in territorial seas, exclusive economic zones and pollution control zones of Member States.\n(28)\nIn order to facilitate the transition to new engine technologies with the potential for significant further emission reductions in the maritime sector, the Commission should further explore opportunities to enable and encourage the uptake of gas-powered engines in ships.\n(29)\nProper enforcement of the obligations with regard to the sulphur content of marine fuels is necessary in order to achieve the aims of this Directive. The experience from the implementation of Directive 1999/32/EC has shown that there is a need for a stronger monitoring and enforcement regime in order to ensure the proper implementation of this Directive. To that end, it is necessary that Member States ensure sufficiently frequent and accurate sampling of marine fuel placed on the market or used on board ship as well as regular verification of ships' logbooks and bunker delivery notes. It is also necessary for Member States to establish a system of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for non-compliance with the provisions of this Directive. In order to ensure more transparent information, it is also appropriate to provide that the register of local suppliers of marine fuel be made publicly available.\n(30)\nComplying with the low sulphur limits for marine fuels, particularly in SOx Emission Control Areas, can result in a significant increase in the price of such fuels, at least in the short term, and can have a negative effect on the competitiveness of short sea shipping in comparison with other transport modes, as well as on the competitiveness of the industries in the countries bordering SOx Emission Control Areas. Suitable solutions are necessary in order to reduce compliance costs for the affected industries, such as allowing for alternative, more cost-effective methods of compliance than fuel-based compliance and providing support, where necessary. The Commission should, based, inter alia, on reports from Member States, closely monitor the impacts of the shipping sector's compliance with the new fuel quality standards, particularly with regard to possible modal shift from sea to land-based transport and should, if appropriate, propose proper measures to counteract such a trend.\n(31)\nLimiting modal shift from sea to land-based transport is important given that an increasing share of goods being transported by road would in many cases run counter to the Union's climate change objectives and increase congestion.\n(32)\nThe costs of the new requirements to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions could result in modal shift from sea to land-based transport and could have negative effects on the competitiveness of the industries. The Commission should make full use of instruments such as Marco Polo and the trans-European transport network to provide targeted assistance so as to minimise the risk of modal shift. Member States may consider it necessary to provide support to operators affected by this Directive in accordance with the applicable State aid rules.\n(33)\nIn accordance with existing guidelines on State aid for environmental protection, and without prejudice to future changes thereto, Member States may provide State aid in favour of operators affected by this Directive, including aid for retrofitting operations of existing vessels, if such aid measures are deemed to be compatible with the internal market in accordance with Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, in particular in light of the applicable guidelines on State aid for environmental protection. In this context, the Commission may take into account that the use of some emission abatement methods go beyond the requirements of this Directive by reducing not only the sulphur dioxide emissions but also other emissions.\n(34)\nAccess to emission abatement methods should be facilitated. Those methods can provide emission reductions at least equivalent to, or even greater than, those achievable using low sulphur fuel, provided that they have no significant negative impacts on the environment, such as marine ecosystems, and that they are developed subject to appropriate approval and control mechanisms. The already known alternative methods, such as the use of on-board exhaust gas cleaning systems, the mixture of fuel and liquefied natural gas or the use of biofuels should be recognised in the Union. It is important to promote the testing and development of new emission abatement methods in order, among other reasons, to limit modal shift from sea to land-based transport.\n(35)\nEmission abatement methods hold the potential for significant emission reductions. The Commission should therefore promote the testing and development of such technologies, inter alia, by considering the establishment of a co-financed joint programme with industry, based on principles from similar programmes, such as the Clean Sky Programme.\n(36)\nThe Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, should further develop measures identified in the Commission's Staff Working Paper of 16 September 2011 entitled ‘Pollutant emission reduction from maritime transport and the sustainable waterborne transport toolbox’.\n(37)\nIn the case of a disruption in the supply of crude oil, petroleum products or other hydrocarbons, the Commission may authorise the application of a higher limit within a Member State's territory.\n(38)\nMember States should establish the appropriate mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this Directive. Reports on the sulphur content of liquid fuels should be submitted to the Commission.\n(39)\nThis Directive should contain detailed indications as regards the content and the format of the report to ensure harmonised reporting.\n(40)\nThe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the amendment of the equivalent emission values for, and the criteria for the use of, emission abatement methods laid down in Annexes I and II to this Directive, in order to adapt them to scientific and technical progress in such a way as to ensure strict consistency with the relevant instruments of the IMO, and in respect of the amendment of points (a) to (e) and (p) of Article 2, point (b)(i) of Article 13(2) and Article 13(3) of this Directive in order to adapt those provisions to scientific and technical progress. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(41)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(42)\nIt is appropriate for the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) established by Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) to assist the Commission in the approval of the emission abatement methods which are not covered by Council Directive 96/98/EC (12).\n(43)\nEffective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties are important for the implementation of this Directive. Member States should include in those penalties fines calculated in such a way as to ensure that the fines at least deprive those responsible of the economic benefits derived from their infringement and that those fines gradually increase for repeated infringements. Member States should notify the provisions on penalties to the Commission.\n(44)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for the transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex III, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nPurpose and scope\n1.   The purpose of this Directive is to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment.\n2.   Reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain petroleum-derived liquid fuels shall be achieved by imposing limits on the sulphur content of such fuels as a condition for their use within Member States' territory, territorial seas and exclusive economic zones or pollution control zones.\nThe limitations on the sulphur content of certain petroleum-derived liquid fuels as laid down in this Directive shall not, however, apply to:\n(a)\nfuels intended for the purposes of research and testing;\n(b)\nfuels intended for processing prior to final combustion;\n(c)\nfuels to be processed in the refining industry;\n(d)\nfuels used and placed on the market in the outermost regions of the Union, provided that the relevant Member States ensure that, in those regions:\n(i)\nair quality standards are respected;\n(ii)\nheavy fuel oils are not used if their sulphur content exceeds 3 % by mass;\n(e)\nfuels used by warships and other vessels on military service.

Paragraph 1 shall not apply:\n(a)\nwhenever, according to published timetables, ships are due to be at berth for less than two hours;\n(b)\nto ships which switch off all engines and use shore-side electricity while at berth in ports.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that marine gas oils are not placed on the market in their territory if the sulphur content of those marine gas oils exceeds 0,10 % by mass.\nArticle 8\nEmission abatement methods\n1.   Member States shall allow the use of emission abatement methods by ships of all flags in their ports, territorial seas, exclusive economic zones and pollution control zones, as an alternative to using marine fuels that meet the requirements of Articles 6 and 7, subject to paragraphs 2 and 4 of this Article.\n2.   Ships using the emission abatement methods referred to in paragraph 1 shall continuously achieve reductions of sulphur dioxide emissions that are at least equivalent to the reductions that would be achieved by using marine fuels that meet the requirements of Articles 6 and 7. Equivalent emission values shall be determined in accordance with Annex I.\n3.   Member States shall, as an alternative solution for reducing emissions, encourage the use of onshore power supply systems by docked vessels.\n4.   The emission abatement methods referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with the criteria specified in the instruments referred to in Annex II.\n5.   Where justified in the light of scientific and technical progress regarding alternative emission abatement methods and in such a way as to ensure strict consistency with the relevant instruments and standards adopted by the IMO, the Commission shall:\n(a)\nbe empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 16, amending Annexes I and II;\n(b)\nadopt implementing acts laying down the detailed requirements for monitoring of emissions, where appropriate.

II\n—\nAnnex III\n—\nAnnex IV", "summary": "Fuels — reducing sulphur content\nFuels — reducing sulphur content\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective (EU) 2016/802 — reducing the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt codifies and repeals Council Directive 1999/32/EC — the existing European Union (EU) legislation — which had been substantially amended several times.\nIt aims to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide that result from burning certain types of liquid fuels.\nIt should therefore reduce the harmful effects of these emissions on health and the environment, which could exceed those from all land-based sources in the EU by 2020.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of:\nheavy fuel oil,\ngas oil,\nmarine gas oil; and\nmarine diesel oil.\nHeavy fuel oil and gas oil\nEU countries have to prohibit the use, in their territories, of:\nheavy fuel oils if their sulphur content exceeds 1% by mass;\ngas oils if their sulphur content exceeds 0.1% by mass.\nMarine fuels\nThe directive incorporates the main changes in international law on preventing air pollution from ships. It incorporates into EU law the revised Annex VI to International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (known as MARPOL) as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating to it, which entered into force on 1 July 2010.\nAnnex VI to MARPOL introduces stricter sulphur limits for marine fuel in sulphur oxide emission control areas (SOx-ECAS) which, in the EU, are found in the Baltic and North Seas and the English Channel. These limits are fixed at 1% as of 1 July 2010 and 0.1% as of 1 January 2015. Higher sulphur contents are still possible, but only if sustainable exhaust cleaning systems are installed on board.\nSince 1 January 2012, in sea areas outside SOx-ECAs, the sulphur limits are 3.5 % and will fall to 0.5 % as of 1 January 2020. The same requirement, also called the global sulphur cap, will also enter into force at international level as decided in October 2016 by the International Maritime Organisation. This landmark decision will significantly reduce the impact of ship emissions on human health and ensure a global level playing field for ship operators.\nEU countries may permit the use of emission abatement methods* that can provide emission reductions at least equivalent to, or even greater than, reduction achievable using low-sulphur fuel, provided that:\nthey have no significant negative impacts on the environment, such as marine ecosystems; and\nthey are developed subject to appropriate approval and control mechanisms.\nImplementation\nTo ensure the directive is correctly implemented, EU countries must:\nensure frequent and accurate sampling of marine fuel placed on the market or used on board ship, as well as regular verification of ships’ logbooks and bunker delivery notes*;\nintroduce penalties that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive to deal with non-compliance.\nIn 2013, technical work started under the European Sustainable Shipping Forum to discuss coordinated strategies to ensure the cost-effective implementation of Directive 2012/33/EU (which amended Directive 1992/32/EC and sought to substantially reduce emissions from shipping due to the combustion of marine fuels). The forum involved the EU countries, the maritime industry and technical assistance from the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA).\nOn the basis of that work, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/253 was adopted. It introduced more inspections in ports of documents and fuel sampling, as well as streamlining the related reporting requirements for the EU countries. It also launched the EU’s information system (Thetis-EU), developed by EMSA for use on a voluntary basis, which allows authorities to share the daily outcomes of sulphur-in-fuel inspections on individual ships.\nScientific and technical progress\nTo keep up with scientific and technical progress, having consulted a committee of EU countries’ representatives, the European Commission has the right to adopt delegated acts to amend the equivalent emission values for, and the criteria for the use of, emission abatement methods.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective (EU) 2016/802 is the codified version of Council Directive 1999/32/EC and its subsequent amendments. It has applied since 10 June 2016.\nBACKGROUND\nEmissions of air pollutants like sulphur dioxide can travel long distances and, in recent years, emissions from maritime transport have increasingly affected air quality in the EU.\nSulphur dioxide emissions cause acid rain and generate fine dust. This dust is dangerous for human health, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and reducing life expectancy in the EU by up to 2 years.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nEmission abatement method: an alternative to using low-sulphur marine fuel, including any fitting, material, appliance or apparatus to be fitted in a ship; or other procedure, alternative fuel, or compliance method. The emission abatement method needs to meet the requirements of this directive by demonstrating that it is verifiable, quantifiable and enforceable.\nBunker delivery notes: documents that a supplier issues to customers as proof that fuel has been delivered.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective (EU) 2016/802 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels (codification) (OJ L 132, 21.5.2016, pp. 58–78)\nlast update 27.02.2017", "tags": ["pollution control measures", "maritime shipping", "air quality", "pollution from ships", "diesel fuel", "fuel oil", "sulphur", "fuel", "reduction of gas emissions"], "subjects": ["Environment", "Fuels"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32016L0802_p1": {"text": "(3)  Council directive 1999/32/ec of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending directive 93/12/eec (OJ L 121, 11.5.1999, p. 13).", "triples": [" directive 1999/32/ec,  amending,  directive 93/12/eec"]}, "32016L0802_p2": {"text": "(13)  directive 98/70/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council directive 93/12/eec (OJ L 350, 28.12.1998, p. 58).", "triples": [" directive 98/70/ec,  amending,  directive 93/12/eec"]}, "32016L0802_p3": {"text": "(1)  Commission decision 2010/769/eu of 13 December 2010 on the establishment of criteria for the use by liquefied natural gas carriers of technological methods as an alternative to using low sulphur marine fuels meeting the requirements of Article 4b of Council directive 1999/32/ec relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels as amended by directive 2005/33/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council on the sulphur content of marine fuels (OJ L 328, 14.12.2010, p. 15).", "triples": [" directive 2005/33/ec,  amended,  decision 2010/769/eu"]}, "32016L0802_p4": {"text": "(2)  directive 2009/28/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing directive 2001/77/ec directive 2003/30/ec (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16).", "triples": [" directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2003/30/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2003/30/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32016L0802_p1": {"text": "In 2013, technical work started under the European Sustainable Shipping Forum to discuss coordinated strategies to ensure the cost-effective implementation of directive 2012/33/eu (which amended directive 1992/32/ec and sought to substantially reduce emissions from shipping due to the combustion of marine fuels).
