Since creativity and the capacity to innovate are also crucial to sustainable economic and social development in Europe, these issues deserve greater emphasis in the context of future European cooperation in the field of education;\n3.\nall levels of education and training can contribute to creativity and innovation in a lifelong learning perspective: the early stages of education concentrating on motivation, learning to learn skills and other key competences, and subsequent stages focusing on more specific skills and the creation, development and application of new knowledge and ideas.\nCONSIDER that:\n1.\ncreativity is the prime source of innovation, which in turn is acknowledged as the main driver of growth and wealth creation, as key to improvements in the social field and as an essential tool in addressing global challenges such as climate change, health care and sustainable development;\n2.\nthere is a growing need for action at national level as well as cooperation at EU level to bring about the more ambitious change necessary if schools are to prepare pupils adequately to face the significant challenges and problems of a fast-changing world;\n3.\nbeyond their essential tasks of ensuring the acquisition of key competences and providing the knowledge triangle with a solid skills base, education and training systems can play a fundamental role in the development of creative and innovative capacities as key factors in enhancing future economic competitiveness and promoting social cohesion and individual well-being;\n4.\nstarting at school level, education systems need to combine the development of specific knowledge and skills together with that of generic capacities linked to creativity, such as curiosity, intuition, critical and lateral thinking, problem solving, experimentation, risk taking and the ability to learn from failure, use of the imagination and hypothetical reasoning, and a sense of entrepreneurship;\n5.\nthe eight key competences for lifelong learning defined in 2006 EU Recommendation (1) relate to skills which are of particular relevance to creativity and the capacity to innovate. In particular, there is a need for skills and competences that enable people to embrace change as an opportunity, to remain receptive to new ideas and to respect and appreciate the values of others;\n6.\nin the face of evidence that diversity and multicultural environments can stimulate creativity, inclusive education policies aimed at tolerance and mutual understanding have the potential to turn the increasing multiculturalism of European societies into an asset for creativity, innovation and growth;\n7.\nthe participation of schools in new and different networks, particularly those based in the local community, can help them to achieve their educational objectives, as well as contribute to the promotion of creativity and innovation. Partnerships between education, the working world and civil society in general are crucial for anticipating and adapting to the changing needs of professional and social life: traineeships, joint projects, peer learning and course instructors from outside education can introduce teachers and pupils to new ideas;\n8.\nteachers have a crucial role to play in nurturing and supporting each child's creative potential, and can contribute to this by exemplifying creativity in their own teaching.\nIn this regard, more personalised, learner-centred approaches to education tailored to the needs and abilities of different learners — including those with special talents — seem particularly conducive to creativity and, notwithstanding their implications in terms of resources and internal organisation, to increasing the motivation and confidence of more practically or artistically oriented learners;\n9.\nteacher education institutions also have a key contribution to make in providing teaching staff with the knowledge and competences required for change, such as the skills needed to promote learner-centred approaches, collaborative working methods and the use of modern learning tools, particularly those based on ICT. Fostering creative abilities and attitudes within schools also requires the support of an organisational culture open to creativity and the creation of an innovation-friendly environment in general, as well as committed and forward-looking leadership at all levels;\n10.\nsince an increasing share of learning occurs at the workplace, in non-formal contexts and in leisure time — often through new ICT-based learning tools and methods — the development of creative and innovative capacities has relevance for all aspects of lifelong learning;\n11.\ngreater research, supported by data sharing, is needed on methods for identifying, defining, measuring and recording learning outcomes in soft transversal skills such as creativity and innovative capacity. There is also a need to provide education policy makers with a stronger evidence base for the promotion of creative and innovative capacities through lifelong learning, and to explore the possible contribution which the EU could make to this process.\nINVITE THE MEMBER STATES TO:\n1.\nconsider how to foster greater synergy between knowledge and skills on the one hand and creativity on the other, as well as how best to promote, monitor and assess creativity and innovative capacity, at all levels of education and training;\n2.\nencourage teachers to develop their professional role as learning facilitators and promoters of creativity, and help teacher education institutions to respond to the new demands of the teaching profession, for instance by promoting collaborative, learner-centred approaches, innovative learning environments and the use of open education resources;\n3.\npromote a learning culture through the development of broader learning communities, by facilitating and supporting networks and partnerships — involving civil society and other stakeholders — between education and related areas such as culture on the one hand, and the working world on the other.\nINVITE THE MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION TO:\n1.\nconsider including the promotion of creativity and innovative capacity among the objectives for current and future European cooperation in the field of education and training as complementary to promoting and supporting the implementation of the 2006 Recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning; and explore appropriate and effective means at European level — such as peer learning — to achieve those goals at all levels of education and training and in a lifelong learning perspective;\n2.\npromote cultural production, intercultural dialogue and cooperation at local, regional, national and international level with a view to developing environments especially conducive to creativity and innovation;\n3.\ncreate synergies to support the promotion of creativity and innovation through active cooperation with relevant international organisations, in particular the Council of Europe, Unesco and the OECD, on topics such as intercultural education, democracy, tolerance and human rights (The right of participation of all Member States in such work should be ensured);\n4.\nencourage and support the development, exchange and dissemination of good practice on evidence-based education policy relating to the promotion of creative and innovative skills in Europe;\n5.\nmake appropriate use of EU programmes and instruments to promote and support creativity and innovative capacity at all stages of lifelong learning, as well as in the educational process itself.\nAND INVITES THE COMMISSION TO:\n1.\nsupport relevant research, and analyse and exchange data, at both EU level and among the Member States — in cooperation with European and international research institutions — on the promotion and development of creative and innovative skills through education and training;\n2.\nin the process of designing a new strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training beyond 2010, continue efforts to raise the level of understanding on issues associated with the development of creative and innovative capacity through education and training within the overall context of a broad-based innovation policy for the EU.\n(1)  Recommendation 2006/962/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong

innovation are considered crucial tools for growth and sustainable development. Education and training are seen to contribute to the promotion of these capacities. Hence, further action is needed both at the national and EU level to incorporate creativity and innovation into lifelong learning.\nACT\nConclusions of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council of 22 May 2008 on promoting creativity and innovation through education and training [Official Journal C 141 of 7.6.2008].\nSUMMARY\nThe ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme promotes the common European objectives of quality, access and openness to the wider world. Since creativity and innovation are also relevant for dealing with global challenges, they should be incorporated into the future framework of European cooperation in the education field. Education and training can develop creative and innovative capacities, which in turn contribute to sustainable economic and social development in Europe.\nThe 2006 Recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning lists eight competences that contain skills relevant for creativity and innovation. Among them, the abilities to see change as an opportunity, to be open to new ideas and to respect others’ values are particularly important. Inclusive education policies that promote tolerance and understanding should be designed in order to turn multiculturalism into an asset for creativity, innovation and growth.\nNew research is needed to identify, measure and document learning outcomes, especially on soft skills like creative and innovative capacities. In addition, to promote these capacities, substantive data need to be presented to policy-makers. The contribution of the EU in this process must also be considered.\nConsequently, the Member States are called upon to:\npromote the incorporation of creativity and innovation at all levels of education and training;\nsupport the professional development of teachers as mediators of creativity and innovation;\nencourage the development of a learning culture where networks and partnerships between educational institutions and related bodies are forged with the corporate sector.\nIt is suggested that both the Member States and the Commission:\nconsider complementing the objectives of European cooperation in education with the promotion of creative and innovative capacity, and supporting the implementation of the 2006 Recommendation on key competencies for lifelong learning;\ndevelop environments that favour creativity and innovation by promoting multi-level cooperation, intercultural dialogue and cultural production;\npromote creativity and innovation in collaboration with appropriate international organisations, such as the Council of Europe, Unesco and the OECD;\npromote the development, exchange and dissemination of good practice on evidence-based education policies relating to creative and innovative skills;\npromote creativity and innovation at all stages of lifelong learning through the EU programmes and instruments.\nFinally, the Commission is called upon to:\nsupport relevant research, analysis and exchange of data on the promotion of creative and innovative capacity through education and training;\nincorporate the development of creative and innovative capacity through education and training into the European education cooperation beyond 2010 and the broad-based European innovation policy.\nBackground\nThese conclusions build upon the outcomes of the Conference on Promoting Innovation and Creativity: Schools’ Response to the Challenges of Future Societies of 9-10 April 2008 and on the political background set out in the Annex to these conclusions. The latter includes notably the Council conclusions of 4 December 2006 on a Broad-based Innovation Strategy: Strategic Priorities for Innovation at EU level, which were based on the Commission Communication COM(2006) 502 of 13 September 2006 on a European innovation strategy. These perceive education as one of the pre-conditions for innovation, indicating the importance of supporting the development of talent and creativity from an early age through education.\nSee also\nFor further information about innovation and creativity in education and training, please visit the Education and Training portal.\nLast updated: 31.07.2008", "tags": ["education policy", "economic growth", "anti-discriminatory measure", "cultural pluralism", "continuing vocational training"], "subjects": ["Education, vocational training and youth"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
