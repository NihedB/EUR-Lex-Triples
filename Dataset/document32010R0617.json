The availability of regular and up-to-date data and information should enable the Commission to make the necessary comparisons, evaluations or to propose relevant measures based on appropriate figures and analysis, in particular concerning the future energy supply-demand balance.\n(2)\nThe energy landscape within and outside the Union has changed significantly in recent years and makes investment in energy infrastructure a crucial issue for securing the Union’s energy supply, for the functioning of the internal market and for the transition towards a low-carbon energy system the Union has begun.\n(3)\nThe new energy context requires significant investment in all kinds of infrastructure in all energy sectors as well as the development of new types of infrastructure and new technologies to be taken up by the market. The liberalisation of the energy sector and the further integration of the internal market give a more prominent role to economic operators for investment. At the same time, new policy requirements such as targets affecting the fuel mix will alter Member States’ policies towards new and/or modernised energy infrastructure.\n(4)\nIn this context, greater attention should be paid to investment in energy infrastructure in the Union, in particular with a view to anticipating problems, promoting best practices and establishing greater transparency on the future development of the Union’s energy system.\n(5)\nThe Commission and in particular its Market Observatory for Energy should therefore have at its disposal accurate data and information on investment projects, including decommissioning, in the most significant components of the energy system of the Union.\n(6)\nData and information regarding foreseeable developments in production, transmission and storage capacities and projects in the various energy sectors are of interest to the Union and important to future investment. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the Commission is notified of investment projects on which construction or decommissioning work has started or on which a final investment decision has been taken.\n(7)\nPursuant to Articles 41 and 42 of the Euratom Treaty, undertakings are under an obligation to notify their investment projects. It is necessary to supplement such information with, in particular, a regular reporting on the implementation of investment projects. Such additional reporting is without prejudice to Articles 41 to 44 of the Euratom Treaty.\n(8)\nIn order for the Commission to have a consistent view of the future developments of the Union’s energy system as a whole, a harmonised reporting framework for investment projects based on updated categories for official data and information to be transmitted by the Member States is necessary.\n(9)\nMember States should, to this end, notify to the Commission, data and information on investment projects in energy infrastructure concerning production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas, electricity, including electricity from renewable sources, bio-fuels and the capture and storage of carbon dioxide planned or under construction in their territory, including interconnections with third countries. Undertakings concerned should be under an obligation to notify to the Member State the data and information in question.\n(10)\nGiven the time horizon of investment projects in the energy sector, reporting every two years should be sufficient.\n(11)\nWith a view to avoiding disproportionate administrative burdens and to minimise costs to Member States and undertakings in particular for small and medium enterprises, this Regulation should give the possibility to exempt Member States and undertakings from reporting obligations provided that equivalent information is supplied to the Commission pursuant to energy sector-specific legal acts, adopted by the institutions of the Union, aiming at achieving the objectives of competitive energy markets in the Union, of sustainability of the energy system of the Union and of the security of energy supply to the Union. Any duplication of reporting requirements specified in the third internal market package for electricity and natural gas should therefore be avoided.\n(12)\nTo process data as well as to simplify and secure data notification, the Commission and in particular its Market Observatory for Energy should be able to take all appropriate measures to that effect, in particular the operation of integrated IT tools and procedures.\n(13)\nThe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Member States is governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), while the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Commission is governed by Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). This Regulation leaves those provisions intact.\n(14)\nMember States, or their delegated entities, and the Commission should preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive data and information. Therefore, Member States or their delegated entities should, with the exception of data and information related to crossborder transmission projects, aggregate such data and information at national level before submitting it to the Commission. If required the Commission should further aggregate this data in such a way that no details concerning individual undertakings and installations are disclosed or can be inferred.\n(15)\nThe Commission and in particular its Market Observatory for Energy should provide a regular and cross-sector analysis of the structural evolution and perspectives of the Union energy system and, where appropriate, more focused analysis on certain aspects of this energy system. This analysis should in particular contribute to identifying possible infrastructure and investment gaps in view of an energy supply and demand balance. The analysis should also form a contribution to a discussion at Union level about energy infrastructures and should therefore be forwarded to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee and made available to interested parties.\n(16)\nThe Commission may be assisted by experts from Member States or any other competent experts, with a view to developing a common understanding of potential infrastructure gaps and associated risks and to fostering transparency regarding future developments.\n(17)\nBuilding as far as possible on the notification format used under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2386/96 (3) which is applying Council Regulation (EC) No 736/96 of 22 April 1996 on notifying the Commission of investment projects of interest to the Community in the petroleum, natural gas and electricity sectors (4), and after consultation of national experts, the technical measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted by the Commission.\n(18)\nGiven the extent of amendments necessary to adapt it to today’s energy challenges and for the sake of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 736/96 should be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

The European Commission should have access to regular information on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the EU. This Regulation meets this requirement by establishing a framework for the exchange of data and information on future production, transmission and storage capacities for energy.\nACT\nCouncil Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 of 24 June 2010 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union and repealing Regulation (EC) No 736/96.\nSUMMARY\nThis Regulation defines a common framework for the notification to the European Commission of information relating to investment projects * in energy infrastructure *.\nSectors and types of investment projects concerned\nThis Regulation applies to energy infrastructure in the following sectors:\noil (refining, transport and storage);\nnatural gas (transmission, LNG terminals and storage);\nelectricity (production and transmission);\nbiofuel (production);\ncarbon dioxide (transport and storage).\nNotification of information to the Commission\nIn the case of infrastructure which is planned or under construction, the following data shall be notified to the Commission:\nthe volume of the capacities planned or under construction;\nthe type and main characteristics of infrastructure or capacities planned or under construction;\nthe probable year of commissioning;\nthe energy source used;\nthe installations capable of responding to security of supply crises;\nthe equipment of carbon capture systems.\nWith regard to decommissioning, the Commission shall receive information on the character and the capacity of the infrastructure concerned, and the probable year of decommissioning.\nMember States shall collect this data from the undertakings which make the investments concerned or by any other equivalent means. Member States shall notify the Commission of this data in aggregated form by 31 July of the reporting year. The first reporting year shall be 2011 and from then onwards every two years. This task may be delegated to a specific body *.\nMember States may present estimated or preliminary information on investment projects for infrastructure falling within the scope of the Regulation if the work is scheduled to start within five years or for which decommissioning is scheduled within three years.\nWhen this data is communicated, Member States shall ensure the quality, relevance, accuracy, clarity, timeliness and coherence thereof.\nThe Commission’s role\nThe Commission shall prepare an analysis of investment projects and development perspectives for the European energy system based on the data received. It shall discuss this analysis with interested parties such as the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO) for electricity, the ENTSO for gas, the Gas Coordination Group, and the Oil Supply Group. The Commission shall present the analysis to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, and shall publish its report.\nThe Commission may publish the data that it receives within the limits of personal data protection by virtue of Directive 95/46/EC and on condition that no confidential or sensitive information concerning an undertaking or installation is divulged.\nThis regulation repeals Regulation (EC) No 736/96.\nKey terms of the Act\nInvestment projects: projects aiming at building new infrastructure, transforming, modernising, increasing or reducing capacities of existing infrastructure, partial or total decommissioning of existing infrastructure.\nInfrastructure: any type of installations or part of installations related to production, transmission and storage.\nSpecific body: a body entrusted with the preparation and adoption of Union-wide multi-annual network development and investment plans in energy infrastructure.\nReference\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010\n4.8.2010\n-\nOJ L 180 of 15.7.2010\nRELATED ACTS\nCommission Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 833/2010 of 21 September 2010 implementing Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union.\n               This Regulation indicates how Member States are to notify the European Commission of information on investment projects in the field of energy. It repeals Regulation (EC) No 2386/96.\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 17 November 2010 – Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond – A Blueprint for an integrated European energy network [COM(2010) 677 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nThis Communication stresses the need to implement a new European energy infrastructure policy in order to achieve the objectives laid down by the Energy 2020 strategy.\nBy 2020, the European Commission believes that nearly one trillion euros will have to be invested in the European energy system, 200 billion of which will have to be devoted to energy transmission networks alone. Although the costs of these investments are huge, it would be more expensive not to carry them out because national solutions would be 20% more expensive.\nIn the longer term, the Commission wishes to introduce networks of the future comprising European Electricity Highways and European CO2 transport infrastructure. To accelerate the introduction of these projects, permit granting procedures should be made faster and more transparent, and a stable framework for financing should be created. The Commission therefore intends to propose new tools combining existing financial mechanisms with other innovations.\nLast updated: 07.02.2011", "tags": ["natural gas", "petroleum", "energy policy", "investment project", "European Commission", "data processing", "energy distribution", "EU action", "exchange of information", "electrical energy"], "subjects": ["Energy", "Information and verification", "Investments"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32010R0617_p1": {"text": "COUNCIL regulation 617/2010///of 24 June 2010---concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union and repealing regulation 736/96", "triples": [" regulation 617/2010,  repealing,  regulation 736/96"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32010R0617_p1": {"text": "Council regulation 617/2010 of 24 June 2010 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union and repealing regulation 736/96.", "triples": [" regulation 617/2010,  repealing,  regulation 736/96"]}, "32010R0617_p2": {"text": "Commission regulation 833/2010 of 21 September 2010 implementing Council regulation 617/2010 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union.", "triples": [" regulation 833/2010,  implementing,  regulation 617/2010"]}}}
