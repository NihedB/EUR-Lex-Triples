{"celex_id": "32004L0082", "reference": "6.8.2004\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 261/24\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2004/82/EC\nof 29 April 2004\non the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(a) and Article 63(3)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn order to combat illegal immigration effectively and to improve border control, it is essential that all Member States introduce provisions laying down obligations on air carriers transporting passengers into the territory of the Member States. In addition, in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, the financial penalties currently provided for by the Member States for cases where carriers fail to meet their obligations should be harmonised to the extent possible, taking into account the differences in legal systems and practices between the Member States.\n(2)\nThe European Council of 25 and 26 March 2004 adopted a Declaration on combating terrorism stressing the need to expedite examination of measures in this area and take work forward on the proposed Council Directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data with a view to an early conclusion on this measure.\n(3)\nIt is important to avoid a vacuum in the Community's action in combating illegal immigration.\n(4)\nAs from 1 May 2004 the Council can no longer act on an initiative of a Member State.\n(5)\nThe Council has exhausted all possibilities to obtain in time the opinion of the European Parliament.\n(6)\nUnder these exceptional circumstances the Directive should be adopted without the opinion of the European Parliament.\n(7)\nThe obligations to be imposed on carriers by virtue of this Directive are complementary to those established pursuant to the provisions of Article 26 of the 1990 Schengen Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, as supplemented by Council Directive 2001/51/EC (2), the two types of obligation serving the same objective of curbing migratory flows and combating illegal immigration.\n(8)\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (3), the freedom of the Member States to retain or introduce additional obligations for aircarriers or some categories of other carriers, including information or data in relation to return tickets, whether referred to in this Directive or not, should not be affected.\n(9)\nIn order to combat illegal immigration more effectively and in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, it is essential that, without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC, account be taken at the earliest opportunity of any technological innovation, especially with reference to the integration and use of biometric features in the information to be provided by the carriers.\n(10)\nMember States should ensure that in any proceedings brought against carriers which may result in the application of penalties, the rights of defence and the right of appeal against such decisions can be exercised effectively.\n(11)\nThese measures take up the control options set out in the Decision of the Executive Committee of Schengen (SCH/Com-ex (94) 17-rev. 4), aimed at enabling border checks to be increased and providing for sufficient time to enable detailed and comprehensive checks to be carried out on all passengers through the transmission of passenger data to the authorities responsible for carrying out such controls.\n(12)\nDirective 95/46/EC applies with regard to the processing of personal data by the authorities of the Member States. This means, that whereas it would be legitimate to process the passenger data transmitted for the performance of border checks also for the purposes of allowing their use as evidence in proceedings aiming at the enforcement of the laws and regulations on entry and immigration, including their provisions on the protection of public policy (ordre public) and national security, any further processing in a way incompatible with those purposes would run counter to the principle set out in Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 95/46/EC. Member States should provide for a system of sanctions to be applied in the event of use contrary to the purpose of the present Directive.\n(13)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Directive builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Directive whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(14)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Directive constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point E, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement (5).\n(15)\nThe United Kingdom is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (6).\n(16)\nIreland is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (7).\n(17)\nThis Directive constitutes an act building upon the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the 2003 Act of Accession,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThis Directive aims at improving border controls and combating illegal immigration by the transmission of advance passenger data by carriers to the competent national authorities.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Directive:\n(a)\n‘carrier’ means any natural or legal person whose occupation it is to provide passenger transport by air;\n(b)\n‘external borders’ means the external borders of the Member States with third countries;\n(c)\n‘border control’ means a check carried out at a border in response exclusively to an intention to cross that border, regardless of any other consideration;\n(d)\n‘border crossing point’ means any crossing point authorised by the competent authorities for crossing external borders;\n(e)\n‘personal data’, ‘processing of personal data’ and ‘personal data filing system’ have the meaning as stipulated under Article 2 of Directive 95/46/EC.\nArticle 3\nData transmission\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary steps to establish an obligation for carriers to transmit at the request of the authorities responsible for carrying out checks on persons at external borders, by the end of check-in, information concerning the passengers they will carry to an authorised border crossing point through which these persons will enter the territory of a Member State.\n2.   The information referred to above shall comprise:\n—\nthe number and type of travel document used,\n—\nnationality,\n—\nfull names,\n—\nthe date of birth,\n—\nthe border crossing point of entry into the territory of the Member States,\n—\ncode of transport,\n—\ndeparture and arrival time of the transportation,\n—\ntotal number of passengers carried on that transport,\n—\nthe initial point of embarkation.\n3.   In any case the transmission of the above mentioned data does not discharge the obligations and responsibilities laid down in the provisions of Article 26 of the Schengen Convention for carriers, as supplemented by Directive 2001/51/EC.\nArticle 4\nSanctions\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to impose sanctions on carriers which, as a result of fault, have not transmitted data or have transmitted incomplete or false data. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that sanctions are dissuasive, effective and proportionate and that either:\n(a)\nthe maximum amount of such sanctions is not less than EUR 5 000, or than the equivalent national currency at the rate of exchange published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the day on which this Directive enters into force for each journey for which passenger data were not communicated or were communicated incorrectly; or\n(b)\nthe minimum amount of such sanctions is not less than EUR 3 000, or than the equivalent national currency at the rate of exchange published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the day on which this Directive enters into force for each journey for which passenger data were not communicated or were communicated incorrectly.\n2.   This Directive shall not prevent Member States from adopting or retaining, for carriers which infringe very seriously the obligations arising from the provisions of this Directive, other sanctions, such as immobilisation, seizure and confiscation of the means of transport, or temporary suspension or withdrawal of the operating licence.\nArticle 5\nProceedings\nMember States shall ensure that their laws, regulations and administrative provisions stipulate that carriers against which proceedings are brought with a view to imposing penalties have effective rights of defence and appeal.\nArticle 6\nData processing\n1.   The personal data referred to in Article 3(1) shall be communicated to the authorities responsible for carrying out checks on persons at external borders through which the passenger will enter the territory of a Member State, for the purpose of facilitating the performance of such checks with the objective of combating illegal immigration more effectively.\nMember States shall ensure that these data are collected by the carriers and transmitted electronically or, in case of failure, by any other appropriate means to the authorities responsible for carrying out border checks at the authorised border crossing point through which the passenger will enter the territory of a Member State. The authorities responsible for carrying out checks on persons at external borders shall save the data in a temporary file.\nAfter passengers have entered, these authorities shall delete the data, within 24 hours after transmission, unless the data are needed later for the purposes of exercising the statutory functions of the authorities responsible for carrying out checks on persons at external borders in accordance with national law and subject to data protection provisions under Directive 95/46/EC.\nMember States shall take the necessary measures to oblige carriers to delete, within 24 hours of the arrival of the means of transportation pursuant to Article 3(1), the personal data they have collected and transmitted to the border authorities for the purposes of this Directive.\nIn accordance with their national law and subject to data protection provisions under Directive 95/46/EC, Member States may also use the personal data referred to in Article 3(1) for law enforcement purposes.\n2.

This shall also comprise the information referred to in Article 10(c) and Article 11(1)(c) of Directive 95/46/EC.\nArticle 7\nTransposal\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this Directive not later than 5 September 2006. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.\n2.   Member States shall communicate the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive to the Commission.\nArticle 8\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force 30 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 9\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community.\nDone at Luxembourg, 29 April 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
