In the interests of clarity and rationality that Directive should be codified.\n(2)\nThe internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured.\n(3)\nTrade in foodstuffs occupies a very important place in the internal market.\n(4)\nIndication of the lot to which a foodstuff belongs meets the need for better information on the identity of products. It is therefore a useful source of information when foodstuffs are the subject of dispute or constitute a health hazard for consumers.\n(5)\nDirective 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (5) contains no provisions on indication of lot identification.\n(6)\nAt international level there is a general obligation to provide a reference to the manufacturing or packaging lot of prepackaged foodstuffs. It is the duty of the Union to contribute to the development of international trade.\n(7)\nIt is therefore advisable to provide for rules of a general and horizontal nature in order to manage a common lot identification system.\n(8)\nThe efficiency of that system depends on its application at the various marketing stages. It is nevertheless desirable to exclude certain products and operations, in particular those taking place at the start of the distribution network for agricultural products.\n(9)\nIt is necessary to take account of the fact that the immediate consumption upon purchase of certain foodstuffs such as ice cream in individual portions means that indicating the lot directly on the individual packaging would serve no useful purpose. However, it should be compulsory in the case of those products to indicate the lot on the combined package.\n(10)\nThe concept of a lot implies that several sales units of a foodstuff have almost identical production, manufacture or packaging characteristics. That concept should, therefore, not apply to bulk products or products which, owing to their individual specificity or heterogeneous nature, cannot be considered as forming a homogeneous batch.\n(11)\nIn view of the variety of identification methods used, it should be up to the trader to determine the lot and to affix the corresponding indication or mark.\n(12)\nIn order to satisfy the information requirements for which it is intended, that indication should be clearly distinguishable and recognisable as such.\n(13)\nThe date of minimum durability or ‘use by’ date, may, in conformity with Directive 2000/13/EC, serve as the lot identification, provided it is indicated precisely.\n(14)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\n1.   This Directive concerns the indication which allows identification of the lot to which a foodstuff belongs.\n2.   For the purposes of this Directive, ‘lot’ means a batch of sales units of a foodstuff produced, manufactured or packaged under practically the same conditions.\nArticle 2\n1.   A foodstuff may not be marketed unless it is accompanied by an indication as referred to in Article 1(1).\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply:\n(a)\nto agricultural products which, on leaving the holding, are:\n(i)\nsold or delivered to temporary storage, preparation or packaging stations;\n(ii)\ntransported to producers’ organisations; or\n(iii)\ncollected for immediate integration into an operational preparation or processing system;\n(b)\nwhen, at the point of sale to the ultimate consumer, the foodstuffs are not prepackaged, are packaged at the request of the purchaser or are prepackaged for immediate sale;\n(c)\nto packagings or containers the largest side of which has an area of less than 10 cm2;\n(d)\nto individual portions of ice cream. The indication enabling the lot to be identified shall appear on the combined package.\nArticle 3\nThe lot shall be determined in each case by the producer, manufacturer or packager of the foodstuff in question, or the first seller established within the Union.\nThe indication referred to in Article 1(1) shall be determined and affixed under the responsibility of one or other of those operators. It shall be preceded by the letter ‘L’ except in cases where it is clearly distinguishable from the other indications on the label.\nArticle 4\nWhen the foodstuffs are prepackaged, the indication referred to in Article 1(1) and, where appropriate, the letter ‘L’ shall appear on the prepackaging or on a label attached thereto.\nWhen the foodstuffs are not prepackaged, the indication referred to in Article 1(1) and, where appropriate, the letter ‘L’ shall appear on the packaging or on the container or, failing that, on the relevant commercial documents.\nIt shall in all cases appear in such a way as to be easily visible, clearly legible and indelible.\nArticle 5\nWhen the date of minimum durability or ‘use by’ date appears on the label, the indication referred to in Article 1(1) need not appear on the foodstuff, provided that the date consists at least of the uncoded indication of the day and the month in that order.\nArticle 6\nThis Directive shall apply without prejudice to the indications laid down by specific provisions of the Union.\nThe Commission shall publish and keep up to date a list of the provisions in question.\nArticle 7\nDirective 89/396/EEC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex I, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex II.\nArticle 8\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 9\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 13 December 2011.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
