{"celex_id": "32011R0492", "reference": "27.5.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 141/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 492/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 5 April 2011\non freedom of movement for workers within the Union\n(codification)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 46 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nFreedom of movement for workers should be secured within the Union. The attainment of this objective entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment, as well as the right of such workers to move freely within the Union in order to pursue activities as employed persons subject to any limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.\n(3)\nProvisions should be laid down to enable the objectives laid down in Articles 45 and 46 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the field of freedom of movement to be achieved.\n(4)\nFreedom of movement constitutes a fundamental right of workers and their families. Mobility of labour within the Union must be one of the means by which workers are guaranteed the possibility of improving their living and working conditions and promoting their social advancement, while helping to satisfy the requirements of the economies of the Member States. The right of all workers in the Member States to pursue the activity of their choice within the Union should be affirmed.\n(5)\nSuch right should be enjoyed without discrimination by permanent, seasonal and frontier workers and by those who pursue their activities for the purpose of providing services.\n(6)\nThe right of freedom of movement, in order that it may be exercised, by objective standards, in freedom and dignity, requires that equality of treatment be ensured in fact and in law in respect of all matters relating to the actual pursuit of activities as employed persons and to eligibility for housing, and also that obstacles to the mobility of workers be eliminated, in particular as regards the conditions for the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.\n(7)\nThe principle of non-discrimination between workers in the Union means that all nationals of Member States have the same priority as regards employment as is enjoyed by national workers.\n(8)\nThe machinery for vacancy clearance, in particular by means of direct cooperation between the central employment services and also between the regional services, as well as by coordination of the exchange of information, ensures in a general way a clearer picture of the labour market. Workers wishing to move should also be regularly informed of living and working conditions.\n(9)\nClose links exist between freedom of movement for workers, employment and vocational training, particularly where the latter aims at putting workers in a position to take up concrete offers of employment from other regions of the Union. Such links make it necessary that the problems arising in this connection should no longer be studied in isolation but viewed as interdependent, account also being taken of the problems of employment at the regional level. It is therefore necessary to direct the efforts of Member States toward coordinating their employment policies,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nEMPLOYMENT, EQUAL TREATMENT AND WORKERS’ FAMILIES\nSECTION 1\nEligibility for employment\nArticle 1\n1.   Any national of a Member State shall, irrespective of his place of residence, have the right to take up an activity as an employed person, and to pursue such activity, within the territory of another Member State in accordance with the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action governing the employment of nationals of that State.\n2.   He shall, in particular, have the right to take up available employment in the territory of another Member State with the same priority as nationals of that State.\nArticle 2\nAny national of a Member State and any employer pursuing an activity in the territory of a Member State may exchange their applications for and offers of employment, and may conclude and perform contracts of employment in accordance with the provisions in force laid down by law, regulation or administrative action, without any discrimination resulting therefrom.\nArticle 3\n1.   Under this Regulation, provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action or administrative practices of a Member State shall not apply:\n(a)\nwhere they limit application for and offers of employment, or the right of foreign nationals to take up and pursue employment or subject these to conditions not applicable in respect of their own nationals; or\n(b)\nwhere, though applicable irrespective of nationality, their exclusive or principal aim or effect is to keep nationals of other Member States away from the employment offered.\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply to conditions relating to linguistic knowledge required by reason of the nature of the post to be filled.\n2.   There shall be included in particular among the provisions or practices of a Member State referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 those which:\n(a)\nprescribe a special recruitment procedure for foreign nationals;\n(b)\nlimit or restrict the advertising of vacancies in the press or through any other medium or subject it to conditions other than those applicable in respect of employers pursuing their activities in the territory of that Member State;\n(c)\nsubject eligibility for employment to conditions of registration with employment offices or impede recruitment of individual workers, where persons who do not reside in the territory of that State are concerned.\nArticle 4\n1.   Provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action of the Member States which restrict by number or percentage the employment of foreign nationals in any undertaking, branch of activity or region, or at a national level, shall not apply to nationals of the other Member States.\n2.   When in a Member State the granting of any benefit to undertakings is subject to a minimum percentage of national workers being employed, nationals of the other Member States shall be counted as national workers, subject to Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications (5).\nArticle 5\nA national of a Member State who seeks employment in the territory of another Member State shall receive the same assistance there as that afforded by the employment offices in that State to their own nationals seeking employment.\nArticle 6\n1.   The engagement and recruitment of a national of one Member State for a post in another Member State shall not depend on medical, vocational or other criteria which are discriminatory on grounds of nationality by comparison with those applied to nationals of the other Member State who wish to pursue the same activity.\n2.   A national who holds an offer in his name from an employer in a Member State other than that of which he is a national may have to undergo a vocational test, if the employer expressly requests this when making his offer of employment.\nSECTION 2\nEmployment and equality of treatment\nArticle 7\n1.   A worker who is a national of a Member State may not, in the territory of another Member State, be treated differently from national workers by reason of his nationality in respect of any conditions of employment and work, in particular as regards remuneration, dismissal, and, should he become unemployed, reinstatement or re-employment.\n2.   He shall enjoy the same social and tax advantages as national workers.\n3.   He shall also, by virtue of the same right and under the same conditions as national workers, have access to training in vocational schools and retraining centres.\n4.   Any clause of a collective or individual agreement or of any other collective regulation concerning eligibility for employment, remuneration and other conditions of work or dismissal shall be null and void in so far as it lays down or authorises discriminatory conditions in respect of workers who are nationals of the other Member States.\nArticle 8\nA worker who is a national of a Member State and who is employed in the territory of another Member State shall enjoy equality of treatment as regards membership of trade unions and the exercise of rights attaching thereto, including the right to vote and to be eligible for the administration or management posts of a trade union. He may be excluded from taking part in the management of bodies governed by public law and from holding an office governed by public law. Furthermore, he shall have the right of eligibility for workers’ representative bodies in the undertaking.\nThe first paragraph of this Article shall not affect laws or regulations in certain Member States which grant more extensive rights to workers coming from the other Member States.\nArticle 9\n1.   A worker who is a national of a Member State and who is employed in the territory of another Member State shall enjoy all the rights and benefits accorded to national workers in matters of housing, including ownership of the housing he needs.\n2.   A worker referred to in paragraph 1 may, with the same right as nationals, put his name down on the housing lists in the region in which he is employed, where such lists exist, and shall enjoy the resultant benefits and priorities.\nIf his family has remained in the country whence he came, they shall be considered for this purpose as residing in the said region, where national workers benefit from a similar presumption.\nSECTION 3\nWorkers’ families\nArticle 10\nThe children of a national of a Member State who is or has been employed in the territory of another Member State shall be admitted to that State’s general educational, apprenticeship and vocational training courses under the same conditions as the nationals of that State, if such children are residing in its territory.\nMember States shall encourage all efforts to enable such children to attend these courses under the best possible conditions.\nCHAPTER II\nCLEARANCE OF VACANCIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT\nSECTION 1\nCooperation between the Member States and with the Commission\nArticle 11\n1.   The Member States or the Commission shall instigate or together undertake any study of employment or unemployment which they consider necessary for freedom of movement for workers within the Union.\nThe central employment services of the Member States shall cooperate closely with each other and with the Commission with a view to acting jointly as regards the clearing of vacancies and applications for employment within the Union and the resultant placing of workers in employment.\n2.

It enables the former to exercise their right to free movement and to improve their personal and professional situation, and the latter to fill job vacancies and skills shortages.\nJust as someone living in one EU country has the right to take up gainful employment in another, so can employers advertise job vacancies and agree contracts with potential employees from throughout the EU.\nThe legislation codifies and replaces Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, which was substantially amended several times. It ensures the system operates smoothly by outlawing any form of nationality discrimination between EU workers.\nIn particular, it bans: separate recruitment procedures for foreign nationals; andlimits on advertising vacancies or the imposition of specific conditions such as registering with employment offices for people coming from another EU country.\nSimilarly, it is illegal to discriminate between national and other EU workers on employment and work terms, covering: access to employment, including the jobseekers’ assistance by employment offices;working conditions, including pay, dismissal, reinstatement or re-employment;access to training, including in vocational schools and retraining centres.\nThe same principle of access to educational, apprenticeship and vocational training schemes applies to the children of someone who is or has been working in another EU country.\nThe legislation covers certain social rights. A worker working in another EU country is entitled to the same social and tax advantages as nationals of the host EU country. He also has the right to housing benefits in the same conditions as nationals and may register on a housing list, where these exist, in the area where they are working.\nThe legislation also covers equality of treatment as regards membership of trade unions and the exercise of related rights, such as the right to vote and to be eligible for administrative or management posts in a trade union.\nA certain level of language knowledge may be required for a job, but any language requirement must be reasonable and necessary for the job in question.\nThe legislation sets up an Advisory Committee comprising 6 members from each EU country: 2 representing the government, 2 the trade unions and 2 the employers’ associations. This committee assists the European Commission in matters concerning free movement of workers. The European Labour Authority, established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1149 participates in the committee’s meetings as an observer, providing technical input and expertise.\nOne exceptionThe one exception to the non-discrimination principle concerns access to posts involving the exercise of public authority and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the state.
