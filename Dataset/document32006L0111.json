{"celex_id": "32006L0111", "reference": "17.11.2006\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 318/17\nCOMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/111/EC\nof 16 November 2006\non the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparency within certain undertakings\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(Codified version)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 86(3) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCommission Directive 80/723/EEC of 25 June 1980 on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparency within certain undertakings (1) has been substantially amended several times (2). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2)\nPublic undertakings play a substantial role in the national economy of the Member States.\n(3)\nMember States sometimes grant special or exclusive rights to particular undertakings, or make payments or give some other kind of compensation to particular undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest. These undertakings are often also in competition with other undertakings.\n(4)\nArticle 295 of the Treaty provides that the Treaty is in no way to prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership. There should be no unjustified discrimination between public and private undertakings in the application of the rules on competition. This Directive should apply to both public and private undertakings.\n(5)\nThe Treaty requires the Commission to ensure that Member States do not grant undertakings, public or private, aids incompatible with the common market.\n(6)\nHowever, the complexity of the financial relations between national public authorities and public undertakings tends to hinder the performance of this duty.\n(7)\nA fair and effective application of the aid rules in the Treaty to both public and private undertakings will be possible only if these financial relations are made transparent.\n(8)\nSuch transparency applied to public undertakings should enable a clear distinction to be made between the role of the State as public authority and its role as proprietor.\n(9)\nArticle 86(1) of the Treaty imposes obligations on Member States in the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which Member States grant special or exclusive rights. Article 86(2) of the Treaty applies to undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest. Article 86(3) of the Treaty requires the Commission to ensure the application of the provisions of that Article and provides it with the requisite means to this end. In order to ensure the application of the provisions of Article 86 of the Treaty the Commission must have the necessary information. This entails defining the conditions for ensuring such transparency.\n(10)\nIt should be made clear what is to be understood by the terms ‘public authorities’ and ‘public undertakings’.\n(11)\nThe Member States have differing administrative territorial structures. This Directive should cover public authorities at all levels in each Member State.\n(12)\nPublic authorities may exercise a dominant influence on the behaviour of public undertakings not only where they are the proprietor or have a majority participation but also by virtue of powers they hold in management or supervisory bodies as a result either of the rules governing the undertaking or of the manner in which the shareholdings are distributed.\n(13)\nThe provision of public funds to public undertakings may take place either directly or indirectly. Transparency must be achieved irrespective of the manner in which such provision of public funds is made. It may also be necessary to ensure that adequate information is made available as regards the reasons for such provision of public funds and their actual use.\n(14)\nComplex situations linked to the diverse forms of public and private undertakings granted special or exclusive rights or entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest as well as the range of activities that might be carried on by a single undertaking and the different degrees of market liberalisation in the various Member States could complicate application of the competition rules, and particularly Article 86 of the Treaty. It is therefore necessary for Member States and the Commission to have detailed data about the internal and financial and organisational structure of such undertakings, in particular separate and reliable accounts relating to different activities carried on by the same undertaking.\n(15)\nThe accounts should show the distinction between different activities, the costs and revenues associated with each activity and the methods of cost and revenue assignment and allocation. Such separate accounts should be available in relation to, on the one hand, products and services in respect of which the Member State has granted a special or exclusive right or entrusted the undertaking with the operation of a service of general economic interest, as well as, on the other hand, for each other product or service in respect of which the undertaking is active. The obligation of separation of accounts should not apply to undertakings whose activities are limited to the provision of services of general economic interest and which do not operate activities outside the scope of these services of general economic interest. It does not seem necessary to require separation of accounts within the area of services of general economic interest or within the area of the special or exclusive rights, as far as this is not necessary for the cost and revenue allocation between these services and products and those outside the services of general economic interest or the special or exclusive rights.\n(16)\nRequiring Member States to ensure that the relevant undertakings maintain such separate accounts is the most efficient means by which fair and effective application of the rules of competition to such undertakings can be assured. In 1996 the Commission adopted a Communication on services of general interest in Europe (3), which was supplemented by another Communication in 2001 (4), in which it emphasised the importance of such services. It is necessary to take account of the importance of the sectors concerned, which may involve services of general interest, the strong market position that the relevant undertakings may have and the vulnerability of emerging competition in the sectors being liberalised. In accordance with the principle of proportionality it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of transparency to lay down rules on such separate accounts. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with the provisions of the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.\n(17)\nIn certain sectors provisions adopted by the Community require Member States and certain undertakings to maintain separate accounts. It is necessary to ensure an equal treatment for all economic activities throughout the Community and to extend the requirement to maintain separate accounts to all comparable situations. This Directive should not amend specific rules established for the same purpose in other Community provisions and should not apply to activities of undertakings covered by those provisions.\n(18)\nCertain undertakings should be excluded from the application of this Directive by virtue of the size of their turnover. This applies to those public undertakings whose business is not conducted on such a scale as to justify the administrative burden of ensuring transparency. In view of the limited potential for an effect on trade between Member States, it is not necessary, at this time, to require separate accounts in relation to the supply of certain categories of services.\n(19)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to other provisions of the Treaty, notably Articles 86(2), 88 and 296, and to any other rules concerning the provision of information by Member States to the Commission.\n(20)\nIn cases where the compensation for the fulfilment of services of general economic interest has been fixed for an appropriate period following an open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure it does not seem necessary to require such undertakings to maintain separate accounts.\n(21)\nThe undertakings in question being in competition with other undertakings, information acquired should be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.\n(22)\nA reporting system based on ex post facto checks of the financial flows between public authorities and public undertakings operating in the manufacturing sector will enable the Commission to fulfil its obligations. That system of control must cover specific financial information.\n(23)\nIn order to limit the administrative burden on Member States, the reporting system should make use of both publicly available data and information available to majority shareholders. The presentation of consolidated reports is to be permitted. Incompatible aid to major undertakings operating in the manufacturing sector will have the greatest distortive effect on competition in the common market. Therefore, such a reporting system may at present be limited to undertakings with a yearly turnover of more than EUR 250 million.\n(24)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\n1.   The Member States shall ensure that financial relations between public authorities and public undertakings are transparent as provided in this Directive, so that the following emerge clearly:\n(a)\npublic funds made available directly by public authorities to the public undertakings concerned;\n(b)\npublic funds made available by public authorities through the intermediary of public undertakings or financial institutions;\n(c)\nthe use to which these public funds are actually put.\n2.   Without prejudice to specific provisions laid down by the Community the Member States shall ensure that the financial and organisational structure of any undertaking required to maintain separate accounts is correctly reflected in the separate accounts, so that the following emerge clearly:\n(a)\nthe costs and revenues associated with different activities;\n(b)\nfull details of the methods by which costs and revenues are assigned or allocated to different activities.\nArticle 2\nFor the purpose of this Directive:\n(a)\n‘public authorities’ means all public authorities, including the State and regional, local and all other territorial authorities;\n(b)\n‘public undertakings’ means any undertaking over which the public authorities may exercise directly or indirectly a dominant influence by virtue of their ownership of it, their financial participation therein, or the rules which govern it.\nA dominant influence on the part of the public authorities shall be presumed when these authorities, directly or indirectly in relation to an undertaking:\n(i)\nhold the major part of the undertaking’s subscribed capital; or\n(ii)\ncontrol the majority of the votes attaching to shares issued by the undertakings; or\n(iii)\ncan appoint more than half of the members of the undertaking's administrative, managerial or supervisory body;\n(c)\n‘public undertakings operating in the manufacturing sector’ means all undertakings whose principal area of activity, defined as being at least 50 % of total annual turnover, is in manufacturing. These undertakings are those whose operations fall under Section D — Manufacturing being subsection DA up to and including subsection DN of the NACE (Rev.1) classification (5);\n(d)\n‘undertaking required to maintain separate accounts’ means any undertaking that enjoys a special or exclusive right granted by a Member State pursuant to Article 86(1) of the Treaty or is entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest pursuant to Article 86(2) of the Treaty, that receives public service compensation in any form whatsoever in relation to such service and that carries on other activities;\n(e)\n‘different activities’ means, on the one hand, all products or services in respect of which a special or exclusive right is granted to an undertaking or all services of general economic interest with which an undertaking is entrusted and, on the other hand, each other separate product or service in respect of which the undertaking is active;\n(f)\n‘exclusive rights’ means rights that are granted by a Member State to one undertaking through any legislative, regulatory or administrative instrument, reserving it the right to provide a service or undertake an activity within a given geographical area;\n(g)\n‘special rights’ means rights that are granted by a Member State to a limited number of undertakings, through any legislative, regulatory or administrative instrument, which, within a given geographical area:\n(i)\nlimits to two or more the number of such undertakings, authorised to provide a service or undertake an activity, otherwise than according to objective, proportional and non-discriminatory criteria; or\n(ii)\ndesignates, otherwise than according to such criteria, several competing undertakings, as being authorised to provide a service or undertake an activity; or\n(iii)\nconfers on any undertaking or undertakings, otherwise than according to such criteria, any legal or regulatory advantages which substantially affect the ability of any other undertaking to provide the same service or to operate the same activity in the same geographical area under substantially equivalent conditions.\nArticle 3\nThe transparency referred to in Article 1(1) shall apply in particular to the following aspects of financial relations between public authorities and public undertakings:\n(a)\nthe setting-off of operating losses;\n(b)\nthe provision of capital;\n(c)\nnon-refundable grants, or loans on privileged terms;\n(d)\nthe granting of financial advantages by forgoing profits or the recovery of sums due;\n(e)\nthe forgoing of a normal return on public funds used;\n(f)\ncompensation for financial burdens imposed by the public authorities.\nArticle 4\n1.   To ensure the transparency referred to in Article 1(2), the Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that for any undertaking required to maintain separate accounts:\n(a)\nthe internal accounts corresponding to different activities are separate;\n(b)\nall costs and revenues are correctly assigned or allocated on the basis of consistently applied and objectively justifiable cost accounting principles;\n(c)\nthe cost accounting principles according to which separate accounts are maintained are clearly established.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall only apply to activities which are not covered by specific provisions laid down by the Community and shall not affect any obligations of Member States or undertakings arising from the Treaty or from such specific provisions.\nArticle 5\n1.   As far as the transparency referred to in Article 1(1) is concerned, this Directive shall not apply to financial relations between the public authorities and:\n(a)\npublic undertakings, as regards services the supply of which is not liable to affect trade between Member States to an appreciable extent;\n(b)\ncentral banks;\n(c)\npublic credit institutions, as regards deposits of public funds placed with them by public authorities on normal commercial terms;\n(d)\npublic undertakings whose total annual net turnover over the period of the two financial years preceding that in which the funds referred to in Article 1(1) are made available or used has been less than EUR 40 million. However, for public credit institutions the corresponding threshold shall be a balance sheet total of EUR 800 million.\n2.   As far as the transparency referred to in Article 1(2) is concerned, this Directive shall not apply:\n(a)\nto undertakings, as regards services the supply of which is not liable to affect trade between Member States to an appreciable extent;\n(b)\nto undertakings whose total annual net turnover over the period of the two financial years preceding any given year in which it enjoys a special or exclusive right granted by a Member State pursuant to Article 86(1) of the Treaty, or in which it is entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest pursuant to Article 86(2) of the Treaty is less than EUR 40 million; however, for public credit institutions the corresponding threshold shall be a balance sheet total of EUR 800 million;\n(c)\nto undertakings which have been entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest pursuant to Article 86(2) of the Treaty if the compensation they receive, in any form whatsoever, was fixed for an appropriate period following an open, transparent and non-discriminating procedure.\nArticle 6\n1.   Member States shall ensure that information concerning the financial relations referred to in Article 1(1) be kept at the disposal of the Commission for five years from the end of the financial year in which the public funds were made available to the public undertakings concerned. However, where the same funds are used during a later financial year, the five-year time limit shall run from the end of that financial year.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that information concerning the financial and organisational structure of undertakings referred to in Article 1(2) be kept at the disposal of the Commission for five years from the end of the financial year to which the information refers.\n3.

Member States whose public undertakings operate in the manufacturing sector shall supply the financial information as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 to the Commission on an annual basis within the timetable contained in paragraph 5.\n2.   The financial information required for each public undertaking operating in the manufacturing sector and in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be the annual report and annual accounts, in accordance with the definition of Council Directive 78/660/EEC (6). The annual accounts and annual report include the balance sheet and profit/loss account, explanatory notes, together with accounting policies, statements by directors, segmental and activity reports. Moreover, notices of shareholders' meetings and any other pertinent information shall be provided.\nThe reports required shall be provided for each individual public undertaking separately, as well as for the holding or subholding company which consolidates several public undertakings in so far as the consolidated sales of the holding or subholding company lead to its being classified as ‘manufacturing’.\n3.

OF THIS DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt aims to ensure transparency in financial relations between European Union (EU) countries and state-owned companies so as to ensure there is fair competition with, and no discrimination against, private companies.\nKEY POINTS\nSpecifically, EU countries are required to ensure the transparency of any public funds which are made available to state-owned companies, how they are used and ensure that the costs and income of such companies are clearly set out in separate accounts.\nThe kinds of financial relations covered by the directive include the provision of capital, grants or loans on privileged terms and the setting-off of operating losses*.\nEU countries must ensure that the internal accounts of the companies concerned are kept separate in relation to their different activities, and that all costs and income are correctly set out according to proper cost accounting principles.\nCertain kinds of financial relations are excluded from the directive, e.g. between EU countries and central banks, or with state-owned companies involving the supply of services which are unlikely to have a significant impact on trade between EU countries.\nEU countries must ensure that the relevant financial information is made available to the European Commission for up to 5 years after the public funds were provided to the company. The Commission, however, must not disclose any information covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.\nRegarding the manufacturing sector, this information has to be provided to the Commission on an annual basis and should include the annual report and annual accounts.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 20 December 2006. Directive 2006/111/EC codifies and replaces Directive 80/723/EEC and its subsequent amendments. The original Directive 80/723/EEC had to become law in the EU countries by 1981.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nLegislation — Transparency of public undertakings on the European Commission's website.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nSetting off of losses: accounting term whereby if a loss is recorded, it is set against a profitable item in order to cancel out its effect.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Directive 2006/111/EC of 16 November 2006 on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparency within certain undertakings (Codified version) (OJ L 318, 17.11.2006, pp. 17-25)\nlast update 24.05.2019", "tags": ["public finance", "financial management", "public authorities", "economic relations", "codification of EU law", "administrative transparency", "public sector", "State aid"], "subjects": ["Competition", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Approximation of laws"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32006L0111_p1": {"text": "It has applied since 20 December 2006. directive 2006/111/ec codifies and replaces directive 80/723/eec and its subsequent amendments.
