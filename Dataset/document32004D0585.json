The amount allocated to each RAC for operating costs will not exceed 90 % of its operating budget and may not exceed 200 000 EUR in the first year. In the four following years, the maximum financial contribution will be degressive (1) and depend on the budget available. The Commission will conclude with each RAC and for each year an ‘operating grant agreement’ which will set the precise terms and conditions and the procedure for the grant of financing. Only the actual expenses will be subject to the Community contribution, which will be granted on condition that the other sources of financing have been allocated.\nThe eligible costs will consist of the costs necessary to ensure the normal operation of the RACs and enable them to pursue their aims.\nThe following direct costs will be eligible:\n—\npersonnel expenses (cost of personnel per day of work on the project),\n—\nnew or used equipment,\n—\nmaterials and supplies,\n—\ndissemination of information to members,\n—\ntravel and accommodation expenses of experts attending RAC meetings (based on scales or rules laid down by the Commission departments),\n—\naudits,\n—\na contingency reserve of not more than 5 % of eligible direct costs.\nPart 2\nInterpretation and translation costs\nThe Commission will conclude with each RAC and for each year an action grant agreement of up to 50 000 EUR which will set the precise terms and conditions and the procedure for the grant of financing.\n(1)  First year: 200 000 EUR (90 %), second year: 165 000 EUR (75 %), third year: 132 000 EUR (60 %), fourth year: 121 000 EUR (55 %), fifth year: 110 000 EUR (50 %).", "summary": "Regional Advisory Councils\nRegional Advisory Councils\nThe establishment of Regional Advisory Councils (RACs), a mainstay of the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP), seeks to involve stakeholders in the fisheries sector more closely in the decision-making process in this field. Through these ongoing forums, all the parties concerned will be able to maintain a dialogue and cooperate in the development and implementation of the CFP.\nACT\nCouncil Decision 2004/585/EC of 19 July 2004 establishing Regional Advisory Councils under the Common Fisheries Policy [See amending acts].\nSUMMARY\nBy this Decision, the Council intends to adopt a general framework for establishing Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) in order to encourage participation by the fisheries sector * in the formulation and management of the common fisheries policy (CFP). Within that context, the parties concerned may make recommendations and suggestions to the Commission and the competent national authorities regarding the geographical areas covered by an RAC.\nEstablishment\nThe RACs consist of management units based on biological criteria. They cover sea areas which are the concern of at least two Member States. An RAC is therefore established for:\nthe Baltic Sea;\nthe Mediterranean Sea;\nthe North Sea;\nnorth-western waters;\nsouth-western waters;\npelagic stocks;\nthe high seas/long distance fleet.\nWhere a matter is of interest to various RACs, they will coordinate their positions and adopt joint recommendations on that issue.\nEstablishment procedure\nIn order to establish an RAC, the stakeholders must submit a properly documented request to the Member States concerned * and the Commission. If the Member States consider the request to be compatible with this Decision, they will send a recommendation on the RAC to the Commission. The latter, after evaluation of the recommendation and any necessary amendment to the request, will adopt a decision specifying the date on which the RAC will become operational.\nStructure and composition\nEach RAC will consist of a general assembly and an executive committee.\nThe general assembly will approve each year the annual report and the annual strategic plan drawn up by the executive committee.\nThe general assembly will appoint an executive committee of up to 24 members, which will manage the work of the RAC and adopt its recommendations.\nThe RACs will consist of representatives of the fisheries sector and other interest groups * affected by the CFP. These will be proposed by the organisations representing the fisheries sector and other interest groups to the Member States concerned who will select all the members of the general assembly.\nScientists will be invited to participate as experts in the work of the RACs. The following may also participate as active observers:\nthe Commission;\nnational and regional administrations of the Member States concerned;\na representative of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA);\nrepresentatives of the fisheries sector and other interest groups from third countries on an invitation from the RAC.\nFunctioning\nRACs will adopt the measures necessary for their organisation. They may, for example, establish a secretariat and working groups. They will adopt the measures necessary to ensure transparency at all stages of the decision-making process. Their meetings will, in principle, be open to the public, save in exceptional cases.\nThe members of the executive committee will, where possible, adopt recommendations by consensus.\nFinancing\nRACs may receive Community aid to cover their operating costs, including translation and interpretation. The Financial Regulation provides for such aid for bodies pursuing a European general interest objective. As regards the procedure, the Commission signs grant agreements with the RACs and may carry out checks to ensure that their expenditure matches the tasks they are supposed to perform.\nKey terms used in the act\nFisheries sector: this includes the sub-sectors fishermen, producer organisations, processors, traders and other market organisations, and women's groups.\nMember State concerned: any Member State having fishing interests in the area or fisheries covered by a Regional Advisory Council.\nOther interest groups: amongst others, environmental organisations and groups, aquaculture producers, consumers and representatives of recreational or sport fishing.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2004/585/EC\n10.8.2004\n-\nOJ L 256 of 3.8.2004\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2007/409/EC\n22.6.2007\n-\nOJ L 155 of 15.6.2007\nRELATED ACTS\nCommission Decision 2008/695/EC of 29 August 2008 declaring operational the Regional Advisory Council for Mediterranean Sea under the Common Fisheries Policy [Official Journal L 232 of 30.8.2008].\nCommission Decision 2007/222/EC of 4 April 2007 declaring operational the Regional Advisory Council for the south-western waters under the common fisheries policy [Official Journal L 95 of 5.4.2007].\nCommission Decision 2007/206/EC of 29 March 2007 declaring operational the Regional Advisory Council for the High Seas/Long Distance Fleet under the common fisheries policy [Official Journal L 91 of 31.3.2007].\nCommission Decision 2006/191/EC of 1 March 2006 declaring operational the Regional Advisory Council for the Baltic Sea under the common fisheries policy [Official Journal L 66 of 8.3.2006].\nCommission Decision 2005/668/EC of 22 September 2005 declaring operational the Regional Advisory Council for the north-western waters under the common fisheries policy [Official Journal L 249 of 24.9.2005].\nCommission Decision 2005/606/EC of 5 August 2005 declaring operational the Regional Advisory Council for pelagic stocks under the common fisheries policy [Official Journal L 206 of 9.8.2005].\nCommission Decision 2004/774/EC of 9 November 2004 declaring operational the Regional Advisory Council for the North Sea under the common fisheries policy [Official Journal L 342 of 18.11.2004].\nLast updated: 19.11.2010", "tags": ["common fisheries policy", "EU regional policy", "institutional structure", "fishing area", "operation of the Institutions", "advisory committee (EU)"], "subjects": ["Fisheries policy", "Provisions governing the Institutions"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32004D0585_p1": {"text": "(1)  For the purposes of this Decision, ICES areas are as defined in regulation 3880/91 (OJ L 365, 31.12.1991, p. 1), Regulation as last amended by regulation 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1) and CECAF Divisions are as defined in regulation 2597/95 (OJ L 270, 13.11.1995, p. 1).
