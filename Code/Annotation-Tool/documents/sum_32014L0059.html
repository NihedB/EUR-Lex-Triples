        üî∫ Annotate triplets ! But what is a triplet ?
    </h2>
<ul>
<li>
        A triplet is composed of 3 elements: <span style=" background-color: yellow">Entity 1</span>, <span style=" color: blue">Action</span>, <span style=" background-color: yellow">Entity 2</span>.
        </li>
<li>
        The entities are legal references to laws, represented in the form of a <span style=" background-color: yellow">court decision</span>, a <span style=" background-color: yellow">directive</span>, a <span style=" background-color: yellow">regulation</span>, etc.
        </li>
<li>
        Actions are represented as verbs: To <span style=" color: blue">ammend</span>, to <span style=" color: blue">repeal </span>, to <span style=" color: blue">implement</span>, etc.
        </li>
<li>
            ‚ùå Please read the text carefully, our goal here is to form relational triplet. Sometimes there are all the elements of a triplet, but they do not form a relational triplet.
