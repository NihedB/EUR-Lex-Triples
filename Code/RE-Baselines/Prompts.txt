----- Zero-Shot Semi-Open Relation Extraction Prompt -----
You're a relation triplet extraction system. 
Given a text, identify and list the relationships between entities within the text.
Extract relationships both within a single sentence (intra-sentence) and across multiple sentences (inter-sentence).
Provide a list of triplets in the format ['ENTITY 1', 'RELATIONSHIP', 'ENTITY 2']. without any additional information. Do not explain how you extract them.
We consider *only* legal entities from this list: [regulation, decision, directive, resolution, recommendation, opinion]. 
The relationships from this set: [repeal, amend, supplement, implement, correct, replace, recast, extend].
